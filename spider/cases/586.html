One order dismissed the plaintiffs application for an extension of time for setting downthe appeal. The other order granted the plaintiffs application for a stay of execution pending appeal of the order for costs madeagainst them below.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The appeal arises from the judgment of Sears J. in an Admiralty action in rem given on the 4th June 1991 dismissing the plaintiffsclaim against the defendants. The plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal on the 6th September 1991 in respect of the judgment, whichdid not deal with the costs of the action. On the 7th September the plaintiffs issued a chambers summons applying for an order extending(in manner hereinafter appearing) the time for setting down their appeal under Order 59 rule 5. On the 26th September the defendantsfiled a respondents' notice supporting the judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On the 21st November Sears J. made an order awarding the costs of the action to the defendants. On the same day the plaintiffs appliedto the judge for a stay of execution of his order for costs, pending appeal. Evidently, being aware of the plaintiffs previous relatedpending application ("the first application") for an extension of time for setting down the appeal, the judge adjourned the plaintiffs'later application ("the second application"), for stay of execution of his costs order, to the hearing of the first application bya single judge of the Court of Appeal. A formal summons in respect of the second application was issued on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On the 6th December both applications came before me and were referred pursuant to Order 59 rule 14(10) for hearing by the Courtof Appeal. after counsel for both parties had indicated that the parties intended in any event to exercise their rights under Order59 rule 14(12) if my decision were adverse to them on the first application, which I regarded as raising a novel issue meriting determinationby the Court of Appeal, Both applications were heard by this court on the 29th and 30th January 1992. For the purposes of Order 59rule 14(4) we regarded the judge's adjournment of the second application to this court as having been properly directed by reasonof the inter-relation of the two applications giving rise to special circumstances making it impracticable for the judge to dealwith the second application on its own. On the 30th January this court dismissed the first application and allowed the second applicationfor reasons which we give now.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The judgment of Sears J. which has given rise to the plaintiffs' pending appeal was concerned with their claim as owners and consigneesof three lots of electrical machinery and equipment which were damaged when in transit on a voyage in the defendants' vessel (the"Dong Do") from Japanese ports to Hong Kong in May 1987. The plaintiffs issued their writ on the 11th July 1988 claiming in bailmentand tort against the defendants as owners of the vessel in question. The defendants raised no defence to liability in tort and quantumwas agreed. However they claimed to have been parties to the three relevant bills of lading comprising or evidencing the contractsof carriage and relied on a contractual or statutory time bar incorporated by the provisions of the bills of lading.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The crucial issue between the parties was therefore whether the defendants, who were not named in the three bills of lading, werenevertheless parties to the contracts off carriage comprised in or evidenced by them and accordingly entitled to the benefit of thelimitation defence made available to the carrier under the bills. The bills of lading had been issued in a printed form by MeishinShipping Co. Ltd. ("Meishin") which was the voyage charterer of the vessel under a Fixture Note dated the 24th April 1987 incorporatingthe terms of a GENCON charterparty. The question thus arose in the action whether the relevant three bills of lading (which had indisputablybeen issued by Meishin with the defendants' authority) were to be interpreted as owners' (i.e. the defendants') bills.or charterers'(i.e. Meishin's) bills.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The judge ultimately decided this question in favour of the defendants. Having held that the bills of lading were governed by Japaneselaw, he first construed them in accordance with Hong Kong law because this was necessary in order to ascertain which party shouldundertake the burden of rebutting the presumption that foreign law is the same as Hong Kong law until proven otherwise. Construingthe bills under Hong Kong law the judge was of the view that they were on their face charterers' bills, but that in each case theeffect of the demise clause (clause 3 of each bill which he held to be a valid clause) was to render the bills shipowners' bills.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> This finding placed the burden on the plaintiffs to show that Japanese law required a different interpretation of the bills. On thisquestion the judge had the benefit of conflicting evidence from a Japanese legal expert for each of the respective parties. Howeverit seems to have been common ground between them that the Hong Kong concept of judicial precedent formed no part of Japanese jurisprudenceand that under Japanese law it was a question of construction whether the bills of lading were shipowners' or charterers' bills.On this question the judge preferred the evidence of the defendants' expert. Whilst he was again of the view that, construed in accordancewith Japanese law, the bills of lading appeared to be, on their face, charterers' bills, the judge held that Japanese law on demiseclauses had not been proved to his satisfaction to be different from English or Hong Kong law. He therefore' concluded that underJapanese law the bills of lading were to be construed (as under Hong Kong law) as shipowners' bills.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In arriving at his conclusion on this last question, concerning the construction of the bills of lading in accordance with Japaneselaw, the judge seems to have been influenced inter alia by two factors. One was that, after judgment had been reserved in the actionon the 26th February 1991, evidence became available of a recent decision (on the 19th March 1991.) by a Japanese court, equivalentto the High Court in Hong Kong, in a case, (referred to as the "<u>Jasmine</u>") where a demise clause was involved and the Japanese court held that the shipowner and not the charterer was the carrier. The defendantsobtained leave to adduce evidence of this decision in the action before judgment was given. Their legal expert relied upon the <u>Jasmine</u> as being of persuasive support to their case. The plaintiffs' expert was unimpressed by the decision which he also sought to distinguishon the facts and he pointed out that it was subject to appeal to a higher court. Of the <u>Jasmine</u> the judge observed in his reserved judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"    I have received an additional affidavit from each expert commenting on a recent decision of the Tokyo District Court, with whichMr. Hiratsuka was concerned. The 'Jasmine' was decided by a Court equivalent to the Hong Kong High Court and the' Chief Justice wasone of the Judges. Whilst the decision appears to be based on a contextual construction of the bill of lading, certain observationsare made about the demise clause which is in the standard form. I am informed that this decision is to [be] appealed, but the generalapproach of the Court to the demise clauses appear[s] in my opinion to equate more closely to Hong Kong law."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Another factor which clearly weighed with the judge was his discernment of underlying error in the evidence of the plaintiffs' legalexpert, upon whom the judge commented towards the end of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> "    However, underlying Mr. Nishiyama's reasoning is his opinion that, as under Japanese law there can only be one carrier, wherea ship is chartered, the ship-owner could not be the carrier. He was asked in cross-examination what would be the position if a shipis voyage-chartered and the shipowner wants to be the contracting party - he answered that this could not be done. He sought to explainthis answer by saying that the space in the ship has been given to the charterer who then becomes the carrier. This line of reasoningonly emerged in oral evidence and seems, in my judgment, to be contrary to the generally held proposition that in a voyage charterpartythe court has to construe the bill of lading to ascertain which of the two competing parties - the ship-owner or the charterer -is the carrier. This exercise is unnecessary if Mr. Nishiyama's assertion is correct</p>            <p class="quote">    As a matter of fact, having considered all the evidence available to me I consider Mr. Nishiyama to be in error. This wrong approachmay well have clouded his opinion on demise clauses."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>1. <u>The first application (extension of time for setting down the appeal)</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In substance the plaintiffs contend by their grounds of appeal that the judge erred in dismissing their claim:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(A) In relation to Hong Kong law because -</p>            <blockquote>                <p>(i) Having correctly construed the bills of lading on their face as shipowners' bills the judge ought to have held that such a constructionwas not displaced by the demise clause (grounds 1 to 3).</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(ii)The judge wrongly regarded the terms of the demise clause in the bills of lading as the same as the standard clause recognisedas valid in Hong Kong whereas the clause in the bills in question in the action contained an additional sentence which rendered theclause materially different from the standard clause (grounds 4 and 5).</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(iii) The judge misconstrued the additional sentence in the demise clause in the bills of lading which, properly construed, was tobe regarded as making it clear that the clause was not a demise clause but was intended inter alia to make it clear that in the presentcase Meishin, as voyage charterers, had not only issued the bills of lading but also undertaken to be the contracting carrier, sothat the judge had wrongly held that the bills were shipowners' bills (grounds 6 to 9).</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(B) In relation to Japanese law because</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>(i)if the judge had construed the bills of lading properly under Hong Kong law, in the manner indicated under (A) above, he wouldhave held that the burden was on the defendants to prove that under Japanese law the bills ought to be construed (otherwise) as shipowners'bills (ground 10).</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify">(ii) The judge erred in his construction of the bills of lading as shipowners' bills under Japanese law in that :</p>                <p align="justify">(a) Having rightly held that on their face the bills of lading were charterers' bills, the judge failed to have regard to five specifiedfeatures of Japanese law which further supported the construction of the bills as charterers' bills (grounds 11 and 12).</p>                <p align="justify">(b) The judge wrongly construed the demise clause in the bills of lading as if it were in the standard form and failed to give theproper construction to the additional sentence in that cl ause (ground 13).</p>                <p align="justify">(c) If clause 3 of the bills of lading was properly to be construed as a demise clause the judge erred in holding that the generalapproach of the Tokyo District Court to demise clauses appeared to him to equate more closely to Hong Kong law, because he oughtto have held that under Japanese law a demise clause is invalid and of no assistance in construing a bill of lading and, in particular,in identifying the parties to the contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the bill (grounds 14 and 15).</p>                <p>(d) In erring as indicated in (c), above and in holding that it had not been proved to his satisfaction that Japanese law on demiseclauses was different from English (Hong Kong) law the judge had wrongly relied on or placed too much weight on the decision of theTokyo District Court in the <u>Jasmine</u> as being evidence that under Japanese law a demise clause was valid (ground 16).</p>                <p align="justify">(e) The judge failed to attach sufficient weight to the plaintiffs' expert witness to the effect that under Japanese law a demiseclause is invalid because the effect of such a clause was to re-introduce Article 759 of the Japanese Commercial Code which has beenexpressly excluded from the Japan International Carriage of Goods by Sea Act ("COGSA") and because such a clause is contrary to Article15(1) of Japanese COGSA. If the judge had given due weight to the evidence of the plaintiffs' expert witness he would have held therelevant bills of lading to be charterers' bills and that the shipowners were not parties to the relevant contract of carriage andso not entitled to the benefit of the time bar provided for in the bills (ground 17, 18 and 19).</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffs' summons for an extension of time sought an order that the time for setting down the appeal (which had not expired)be extended to one month after "final determination or other resolution of the appeal now pending before the Japanese High Courtin the "JASMIN[E]" case or until further order". The application was supported by the affidavit evidence of the plaintiffs' solicitorMr. McIntosh and the plaintiffs' expert witness Mr. Nishiyama, who is acting for the appellant in the <u>Jasmine</u> case which is the subject of appeal from the Tokyo District Court to the High Court. A copy of the relevant part of the equivalentof the appellant's notice of appeal in that case was exhibited to the formal affidavit of a partner of Mr. Nishiyama.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. McIntosh deposed that in the <u>Jasmine</u> case there were different facts which pointed to the contract with the shipowners which the Tokyo District Court found to have beenmade. That court had, Mr. McIntosh deposed, gone on to make incidental observations that "..... a demise clause which provides theshipowner to be the carrier does not make it unclear as to who is the carrier under the Bill of Lading".</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> According to Mr. McIntosh the plaintiffs' first argument in their present appeal will be (as appears from grounds 14, 15 and 16 inthe notice of appeal) that the judge failed to give full weight to the differences between the <u>Jasmine</u> case and the present case and placed too much weight upon the decision of the District Court in the <u>Jasmine</u> case which the judge assumed to have validated the use of demise clauses, whereas the decision of the District Court had been reachedon other grounds. However Mr. McIntosh points out that, in his evidence below, Mr. Hiratsuka, the defendants' legal expert, had deposedthat the decision in the <u>Jasmine</u> was support for the validity of demise clauses under Japanese law. If this be the case, Mr. McIntosh contended, then the <u>Jasmine</u> assumed greater importance in the present appeal because one of the grounds of appeal filed in the High Court in the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal by Mr. Nishiyama is that the Tokyo District Court was wrong in determining that the demise clause is valid and effective inJapanese law. Mr. McIntosh further deposed that if this ground were to succeed, as the appellants in the <u>Jasmine</u> case were advised is reasonably possible, then the chances of the plaintiffs' appeal in the present case will be significantly increasedand they would then seek to adduce further evidence of the <u>Jasmine</u> decision in any subsequent hearing of their pending appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Nishiyama's affidavit was in line with that of Mr. McIntosh which had been clearly based substantially on Mr. Nishiyama's advice.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> By the defendants' respondents' notice they sought to support the judge's decision on the additional grounds that the judge shouldhave held that (1) the relevant bills of lading.were subject to Hong Kong law and not Japanese law and (2) even on its face eachof the bills was a shipowners' bill whether the applicable law was that of Hong Kong or Japan. The second ground was elaborated bythe contention that the judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that (a) on the face of the bill it was stated twicethat the bill was signed for the master and (b) the defendants had authorised the charterers to issue bills of lading on their behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The defendants relied on the affidavit, filed on the 25th November 1991, of Mr. Hiratsuka, who had been their expert witness belowand is acting for the respondents in the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal. He agreed with the evidence of Mr. Nishiyama that the High Court would probably not give judgment in the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal before the expiration of 18 months from the date (10th July 1991) of filing of the appeal. He deposed that he would expectthe judgment to be given in the first half of 1993 although there was slight possibility that it would be given in late 1992. Mr.Hiratsuka added that there was a possibility of a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan. In that event, he deposed, therewould be a further delay of approximately one year even if the Supreme Court were to dismiss the appeal without a hearing, otherwisethe final appeal could take 3 to 5 years, from the time the appeal was lodged.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> On the hearing of the plaintiffs' application by this court the plaintiffs sought leave to file out of time and read an affidavitsworn by Mr. Nishiyama on the 24th January 1992 in reply to Mr. Hiratsuka's evidence regarding the question of further appeal tothe Supreme Court of Japan. This was opposed by the defendants who did not object to the affidavit being read de bene esse. Mr. Nishiyamadeposed to his belief that "while there is a slight possibility of a further appeal" in the <u>Jasmine</u> case it was "very unlikely". His evidence was that there was no appeal to the Supreme Court unless the judgment appealed (a) wasclearly affected by error in the interpretation of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or ordinances or (b) failed to state reasons or stated mutually contradictory reasons. He seems to have inferred that the <u>Jasmine</u> case involved error in making a factual finding. He stated that the Tokyo High Court was unlikely to make errors constituting groundsfor appeal to the Supreme Court. He went on to give evidence of statistics of the percentage (35 per cent) of civil and administrativelitigation where appeals were taken to the Supreme Court and deposed that where maritime cases were taken on final appeal the SupremeCourt gave judgment within one year</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Fok for the plaintiffs submitted helpful and elaborate written submissions in support of the application. He did, not in termsidentify Order 3 rule 5 as the basis for the "general discretion" to extend time which he invited the court to exercise. Howeverwe assume that the plaintiffs intended to invoke that rule because (the summons having erroneously referred to Order 15 rule 15)Mr. Fok did not invoke the inherent jurisdiction of this court to grant a stay which is reserved by section 16(3) of the SupremeCourt Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>). Furthermore Mr. Fok's written submissions referred to the practice notes in the Supreme Court Practice,Vol. 1, pp.918 and 921 relating to the discretion of the court under the rule to extend time for instituting and setting down anappeal. However Mr. Fok rightly acknowledged that this application is not of the same type as was considered by Griffiths L.J. inthe leading case of <u>C.M. Van Stillevoldt B.V.</u> v. <u>El Carriers Inc.</u> [1983]1 WLR 207 and was more in the nature of an application for a stay of the appeal pending the determination of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In order to persuade the court to exercise its jurisdiction to extend time to achieve what amounted to a stay of the appeal Mr. Mokresorted to a number of analogies, including the principles applicable to appeals out of time which he submitted were applicable"because a fortiori, if the Plaintiffs would be permitted to appeal Sears J.'s decision out of time upon the Tokyo High Court decidingthat demise clauses were invalid under Japanese law, the Plaintiffs ought to be entitled to decelerate the process of appeal."</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> There was, in Mr. Fok's submission, good reason to stay the appeal temporarily to enable the Tokyo High Court to determine the issueas to the validity under Japanese law of the demise clause in a bill of lading. Having regard to the defendants' concession as toliability and the judge's finding that the bills were on their face charterers' bills a decision by the Tokyo High Court that demiseclauses were invalid under Japanese law would, Mr. Fok contended,constitute evidence which was likely to be determinative in supportof the plaintiffs' appeal. An analogy was drawn with the procedure for a stay under Order 4 rule 9(1)(a). If the decision of theHigh Court in the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal were favourable to the plaintiffs they would seek to adduce fresh evidence of this fact (pursuant to order 59 rule 10(2) asmatters occurring after trial or, alternatively as evidence admissible in accordance with <u>Ladd</u> v. <u>Marshall</u> [1954]1 WLR 1489) in order to show the true state of Japanese law.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> On behalf of the plaintiffs it was contended that the defendants would not be prejudiced if the application were granted. The judgment,it was said, had no financial consequences for them. The arguments on appeal were purely legal arguments and the defendants had securityin place from their P &amp; I Club in case the appeal succeeded. It was contended that the delay was minimal because it was unlikelythe appeal would came on before the autumn of 1992. Also, the defendants would benefit if the application were granted and the TokyoHigh Court were to uphold the decision of the District Court in the <u>Jasmine</u>. Furthermore, it was contended, if this court were to hear and dismiss the plaintiffs' appeal before the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal were decided it would be open to the plaintiffs to seek leave to appeal to the Privy Council on the basis of the fresh evidenceconstituted by a favourable decision in the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As to a possible further appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan in the <u>Jasmine</u> case, the plaintiffs relied on the evidence of Mr.Nishiyama that such an appeal was unlikely and emphasised that, whereas such anappeal remained a matter of uncertainty, the appeal to the Tokyo High Court was a known fact.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> We were unable to accept these submissions, able though they were, as sufficient to persuade the court to exercise its discretion(whether inherent or under Order 3 rule 5) in favour of the plaintiffs in this application. In exercising the necessary balancingexercise we began with the consideration that, as Mr. Fok, fairly acknowledged, procedural time tables laid down by rules of courtare ordinarily required to be strictly adhered to in this court. In the present case the plaintiffs had elected to institute an appealagainst Sears J.'s judgment. They had done so in time but sought, in effect, to stay the appeal (and the recovery of costs by thesuccessful defendants) until such time (if ever) as the High Court in Tokyo might decide the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal in a manner favourable to their contentions in this appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> If the plaintiffs' application had been granted it seemed to the court to be probable that the hearing of the appeal would have beendeferred from the autumn of 1992 for at least three months and possibly longer, pending the determination of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal in the High Court. In our opinion the possibility, to which Mr. Hiratsuka referred, of a further appeal to the Supreme Courtin Japan (whatever the outcome of the appeal to the Tokyo High Court) could not be ruled out by the contrary opinion of Mr. Nishiyama,whose late affidavit we were prepared to admit although counsel for the defendants informed the court that the affidavit was receivedless than 48 hours before the hearing. At the very least there was a conflict of evidence between the experts on this question, butwe also accepted Mr. Smith's submission that the nature of the arguments in favour of the invalidity under Japanese law of a demiseclause in a bill of lading supported the contention that questions of the construction of COGSA and the Japanese Commercial Codewere involved, so that the possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court could not be ruled out. On this basis, even on Mr. Nishiyama'sevidence, there was a real risk of further appeal and that the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal would not be finally determined (in the Supreme Court) for at least another year after the High Court's decision.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In addition to the risk of substantial (and possibly very substantial) delay if the plaintiffs appeal were stayed, as sought, therewas the fundamental uncertainty as to the outcome of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal in the Tokyo High Court in which the experts of the parties to this appeal are involved on opposite sides. If the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal should not be settled and should be decided in a manner unfavourable to the plaintiffs the stay would have served no usefulpurpose, because the defendants resist the application and are anxious to get on with the plaintiffs' appeal in Hong Kong. It wasthe patent uncertainty of the outcome of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal in the High Court (and possibly in the Supreme Court) which seemed to us to destroy any possible comparison between the plaintiffs'application to extend time to set down the appeal pending the determination of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal and the allegedly obverse situation of an application to appeal out of time after the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal had been determined. Indeed it seemed to us that the plaintiffs were seeking to have it both ways at the expense of the defendantsby an application for what amounted to a stay on the basis of what Mr. Clifford Smith, for the defendants, rightly called a hypotheticalfavourable decision in the Jasmine appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Furthermore, as Mr. McIntosh's evidence and the grounds of appeal summarised above demonstrate, the plaintiffs case on appeal reliesinitially on the argument that in any event the judge misconstrued the demise clause in the bills of lading and placed too much weighton the <u>Jasmine</u> decision in the District Court as being evidence that under Japanese law a demise clause in a bill of lading is valid. The case ismanifestly a complex one involving difficult questions of construction. Despite a forceful argument from Mr. Clifford Smith in supportof the second ground in the defendants' respondents' notice, (as to which we express no opinion save that the ground is clearly arguable),we were by no means persuaded that the initial contentions of the plaintiffs, which do not depend upon the outcome of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal, do not amount to reasonable arguments which in themselves might result in the success of the plaintiffs' appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It follows that the de facto stay sought by the plaintiffs is intended to ensure that, if (but only if) the final outcome (wheneverthat may be) of the <u>Jasmine</u> appeal (to which they are not parties) is favourable to the plaintiffs, they will have the advantage of another and admittedly powerfulargument which might, if the grounds in the respondents' notice (particularly the second ground) fail, decide the appeal in the plaintiffs'favour. The price to be paid by the defendants for the de facto stay was the deferment of the determination of the appeal, from ajudgment in favour of the defendants, for a substantial and uncertain period during which time the defendants would have had to maintainthe security for the plaintiffs' claim of about (US)$300,000 in the form of a Club guarantee which inevitably would have adversefinancial repercussions for the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Weighing all these factors in the balance we were left in no doubt that it would be unjust to grant the plaintiffs' application andthat, although supported by an able argument by Mr. Fok, the novelty of the application was matched by its lack of merit. We thereforedismissed the application, but we will, if necessary grant any formal extension of time that may now be required in the order toenable the appeal to be duly set down without further delay.</p>    <p>2. <u>The second application (stay of execution of the order for costs)</u></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The plaintiffs' first application having been dismissed, the second application had to be considered on the basis that the appealwould have to be set down without further delay. This was therefore a case for the exercise of the court's discretion under Order59 rule 13 in accordance with the general rule of practice that the onus was upon the applicant plaintiffs to satisfy the court thatif there were no stay of execution of the order for costs against the plaintiffs, and those costs had to be paid, there would beno reasonable probability of getting the costs back if the appeal were to succeed. We were left in no doubt that the plaintiffs (whowere prepared to give the usual undertaking for diligent prosecution of the appeal) had discharged this onus.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The plaintiffs had arrested a sister ship of the " Dong Do" when these proceedings began. The defendants secured the release of thearrested vessel upon provision of security of $2.5 million. However it was clear from Mr. McIntosh's evidence that if the plaintiffs'appeal were successful the total amount of their claim and their own costs below and on appeal would exhaust the security which wouldnot cover the amount (approximately $1 million) of the defendants' costs recoverable by the plaintiffs after a successful appeal,if there had been no stay of execution.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The defendants (Hanoi Maritime Transportation Co.) are a Vietnamese corporation. The evidence in support of the application for thearrest of the sister ship ("Hanoi 1") of the "Dong Do" and the evidence of Mr. McIntosh in support of this application indicatedthat Lloyds Register cannot be relied upon for the identification of the vessels owned by the defendants at any specific time. Thusthe Register for 1991/2 showed the defendants as the owners of "Hanoi 1", "Hanoi 02", "Ba Dinh" and "Dong Do" whereas further inquiriesdisclosed that "Hanoi 02" had been owned by another corporation since 1987. Furthermore the defendants' solicitor, Mr. Hardaker,deposed that the vessels currently owned by the defendants were only the "Dong Do" and the "Ba Dinh".</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The defendants relied on the availability of their two vessels, which traded internationally and both of which had called in HongKong during the previous 12 months, as providing ample scope for the enforcement of any claim the plaintiffs might have, in the eventof a successful appeal, to recover the costs paid by them to the defendants. We were not persuaded by these arguments. It seemedto us that, in the light of the combination of the foreign character of the defendants and the uncertainty created by mutations ofownership of foreign vessels which traded internationally, it could not be said that there was any reasonable probability of theplaintiffs being able, as successful appellants, to recover any costs they would have had to pay the defendants if no stay of executionwere ordered.</p>    <p><u>3. Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> No order for costs was made at the conclusion of the hearing of the applications. There will be an order nisi that the defendantsare to have the costs of the first application and the plaintiffs are to have the costs of the second application. In making theorder nisi regarding the second application we have borne in mind that the defendants did not oppose that application conditionallyupon the first application succeeding, but the opposition was unqualified on the issue of reasonable probability of recovery on whichthey were unsuccessful.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Sir Derek Cons)</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Michael Kempster)</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:center">(P.G.
