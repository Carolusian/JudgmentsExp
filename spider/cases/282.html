She submitted that the District Court or any other Court in Hong Kong has no jurisdiction to determine such claims(see <b><i>Hooi Siew Fong Rachel v. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited</i></b> (unreported, CACV 146/2010, 18.2.2011) at paragraph 15 and 17; <b><i>Ngan Yu Chiu v. New World First Bus Services Limited</i></b>(unreported DCCJ 824/2009, 19.4.2010) at paragraph 17-19).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Ms. Tong says that Plaintiffâs claim for <i>âunjust dismissalâ</i> could only be premised upon a breach of the Employment Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiff on the other hand said he actually relied on paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the Ordinance which says the Labour Tribunalshall not have jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim for a sum of money or otherwise in respect of a cause of action, foundedin tort, whether arising from a breach of contract or a breach of duty imposed by a rule of common law or any enactment. He claimshis cause of action against the Defendant is based on tort.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Plaintiff fails to elaborate as to how the <i>âunjust dismissalâ</i> was founded in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  This Court could not see how that the case of <i>âunjust dismissalâ</i> could be a valid claim or recognized cause of action in tort which would entitle Plaintiff to compensation or loss of wages. Thisclaim could only be premised upon a breach of contract. This Court take the view therefore that the District Court has no jurisdictionto deal with the <i>âunjust dismissalâ</i> claim of the Plaintiff. Clearly, the Plaintiff has wrongly commenced the present claim for <i>âunjust dismissalâ</i> in the District Court and such claim would be struck out on such ground.</p>    <p><i><u>Is there a reasonable cause of action regarding the admission to PHD Program?</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I now deal with the Plaintiffâs claim based on his unsuccessful application for admission to the PHD Program.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  This Court is well aware that it is only in plain and obvious case that the Court should exercise its summary power to strike outthe endorsement on any writ or any pleadings. The claim must be obviously unsubstantial, the pleadings unarguably bad and it mustbe impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the Court will strike it out. (Hong Kong Civil Procedure, 2012edition, Order 18/19/4)  </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In traversing the Statement of Claim relating to this part of Plaintiffâs claim, this Court is unable to discover the legal basisupon which the claim is premised upon.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiff has not pleaded any valid cause of action in law in respect of his unsuccessful application for admission for thePHD Program.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I agree as submitted by Ms. Tong that Defendant has no legal obligation to accept Plaintiffâs application for admission. No suchlegal obligation has in fact been pleaded by Plaintiff in the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Plaintiff did complain that the Defendant has failed to give reasons for the refusal to admit him to the PHD Program. Again, I amunable to see legal basis properly pleaded in support of Plaintiffâs submission that a tertiary institution is obliged to offerreasons for refusal of admission to their programs. In any event, even adopting the widest liberal interpretation to the pleadingsof the Plaintiff, now acting in person, no proper cause of action can be made out or was pleaded or was relied upon by the Plaintiffin the Statement of Claim, whether in contract or in tort, that would entitle Plaintiff to the relief sought.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  This part of Plaintiffâs claim must also be struck out as it discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It follows therefore that the claims of the Plaintiff as pleaded in the Statement of Claim should be struck out in their entiretyand the action is dismissed with costs and I so order.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I also make an order nisi that the Plaintiff shall pay the Defendant costs of this action (including costs of this application)with certificate for counsel, the same is summarily assessed at $129,087.</p>    <p> </p><p> </p><table width="100%" border="0">  <tr>    <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>    <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">( K.
