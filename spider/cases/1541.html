All that is alleged in respect of the canopyis that the plaintiff was instructed to work there and that he fell when walking along it, see paragraphs 3 and 5 which read as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â3. On 3rd June 2002, the Plaintiff was in the course of his employment with the 3rd Defendant and was instructed to work at canopyon 1st Floor of Sau Lok House facing Sau Mau Road of the Site (âthe Canopy').  The Plaintiff's duty was, inter alia, to installelectrical cable and cable duct for the air conditioning system of the Site.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â5. At about 5:00 p.m. of the same day when the Plaintiff was walking along the Canopy to the Exit, he slipped and fell from theCanopy through a distance about 4.9 metres to the ground (âthe Accident').â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The canopy and the place of accident</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  According to the Accident Report prepared by the Labour Department, there was a canopy on the first floor of Sau Lok House facingSau Ming Road.  The width of the canopy was 1.5 metres.  The edge of the canopy was totally unfenced, with only a short parapet ofabout 20 cm in height at its edge.  There was a door opening fitted with a metal gate at the end of the canopy.  There were somemetal pipes and metal racks âfound layingâ across the canopy.  Some pools of water covered with mosses were also found on thesurface of the canopy.  The plaintiff's working position was at the other end of the canopy, about 25 metres away from the exit ofthe canopy.  The plaintiff and his co-worker had been installing electrical cable and cable duct for air-conditioning systems fromabout 1:00 pm to about 5:00 pm on 3 June 2002.  After the appellant and his co-worker âhad almost finished the electrical workâ,they âtidied up their tools and walked away from their working position along the edge of the canopy to the exit, which was locatedat the opposite end of the canopyâ.  None of the legal teams took the trouble of seeking from the Labour Department a colouredor better copy of the photographs attached to the report to show with clarity and greater precision the working position, the pondof water with moss and the position where the plaintiff fell.  It is barely sufficiently clear from the 1<sup>st</sup> floor plan and the black and white copy photographs attached to the report that the place where the plaintiff fell was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) not his working position;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) quite some distance away from his working position; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) not at the narrowest strip where the metal pipes and racks and heat exhaust units of split-type air-conditioners were.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In his Declaration dated 16 July 2002, he indicated on photograph 1 that his working position was at one end of the canopy and thathe fell from a position after he had passed the narrowest strip.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In his Declaration dated 26 July 2002, he indicated on photograph 1 that his working position was at one end of the canopy and statedthat he âdid not need to work thereâ (there meaning the position where he fell from the canopy to the ground) and that he wouldpass there only when he entered and exited the canopy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In his testimony, the plaintiff insisted that the place where he fell was at the narrowest strip.  I reject his testimony becauseit is contradicted by his earlier Declarations and the Accident Report and also because he was not a credible witness. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In answer to the question why he was on his way out at about 5:00 pm when his hours of work were from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, he saidthat he had finished work for the day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Based on the Accident Report and the plaintiff's 2 Declarations and the plaintiff's own testimony that he was on his way out atabout 5:00 pm because he had finished work for the day, I find that the plaintiff had finished work on the day of accident and wason his way to the exit when he fell from a position which:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) formed no part of his place of work;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) was quite some distance away from his working position; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) was not at the narrowest strip where the metal pipes and racks and heat exhaust units of split-type air-conditioners were.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Claim against 2<sup>nd</sup>  defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The plaintiff sued the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>, and in negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The simple but fatal objection to the claim under the Ordinance is that there is no allegation in the plaintiff's Statement of Claimthat the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was an occupier of the canopy or any part thereof. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In any event, I am not satisfied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was an occupier of the canopy at the place of fall which was not within the plaintiff's place of work.  All the witnessestestified that they had to get keys from the management office before they could access the canopy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I do not think the claim in negligence takes the plaintiff's claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant any further.  As Mr Anthony Houghton, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, pointed out, it is not part of the plaintiff's pleaded claim that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant came under a duty when it âbecame aware of a dangerâ in the access route.  The place of fall formed no part of theâwork siteâ or the plaintiff's place of work.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had sub-contracted the air-conditioning installation works to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, an ostensibly competent sub-contractor whom the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had been using since 2000.  No authority has been cited to support the proposition that the employer of an independentand ostensibly competent sub-contractor owes the same duty of care to employees of the sub-contractor as the sub-contractor employerdoes.   The authorities which counsel drew my attention to suggested the contrary, see <i>Chong Yiu Tat v Fong Man Chi</i>, unreported, Reyes J., HCPI 742/2001, 24 December 2003, at paragraphs 14-20; <i>Wheat v Lacon</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] AC 552</a>; <i>D &amp; F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 177</a> at p. 209 (contrary to Practice Direction 5.5 paragraph 5, counsel cited another report instead of the Law Reports); and <i>Makepeace v Evans Brother (Reading)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20BLR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] BLR 287</a> at pp. 289-290. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The plaintiff's claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant fails and must be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Claim against 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was the plaintiff's employer.  His duty of care to the plaintiff extended to activities incidental to work such as leavingthe workplace at the end of the work period, see Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts, 19<sup>th</sup> edition, paragraph 13-02 and the Scottish case of <i>Bell v Blackwood Morton &amp; Sons</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1960%20SC%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1960 S.C. 11</a> where the pursuer was injured while she was leaving her place of work on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor via a staircase to go home after the end of the work period. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant realised the danger of passage along the canopy; chose to take up sub-contracting works; simply ignored the danger whichhe had actual knowledge of and sent the plaintiff to work on the canopy.  In my judgment, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant is liable to the plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Plaintiff's contributory negligence</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In his testimony, the plaintiff came up with a new assertion.  He alleged that he told his boss that as there was some water andmoss, it was quite dangerous and that his boss said âbe a bit carefulâ.  If what the plaintiff asserted was true, this showedthat he knew about the danger and that he had been told by his boss to be careful.  The canopy was on the plaintiff's pleaded case1.5 metres wide.  With actual knowledge of the danger, he should have taken the greatest precaution about his own safety; shouldhave taken care to see that the foot he put forward was resting on something solid before putting his weight on it; and should havewalked slowly and carefully along the edge of the building block as far away from the parapet as possible, cf <i>Wheat v Lacon</i> at pp. 570 and 576.  The plaintiff made no allegation of having taken any care of himself.  He did not even walk as far away fromthe parapet as the geography permitted.  He simply ignored the known danger.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I do not think his assertion was true but this does not help his case.  Any person taking proper of himself and having passed andre-passed the canopy a number of times before the accident would have realised the obvious danger presented by the water pond(s),the moss(es), and the absence of any fencing at the parapet.  Such person should have taken the greatest precaution about his ownsafety. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In my judgment, there was contributory negligence on the plaintiff's part.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The only ratio put forward was 50:50.  In the absence of any argument against this ratio, I accept it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Date for resumption of work</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The plaintiff was examined by Dr Yu Yuk Ling, the plaintiff's neurological expert, and Dr Edmund K. W.

There were discrepancies between Mr. Tam's claimed disabilities and objective findings during examination (see Section 15).

Monocular diplopia is in general considered as non-neurological.  He didnot exert fully when motor power of his right upper limb and left lower limb was tested.

He claimed that he had difficulty standing or walking for a longtime which he explained meant 15 â 20 minutes and that he would feel numbness, dizziness, pain and might fall down and that waswhy he used crutches.  His allegations were contradicted by the report of his own orthopaedic expert.  He said he had been to theLabour Department and some employment expos to look for jobs.  Although he had produced a registration card with the Labour Department,he could not be specific about the job(s) he was looking for.  His allegations about visits to expos were, with one exception, vague. The only thing specific was his ludicrous statement which he repeatedly made that he was looking for cleaning jobs, domestic helperjobs and jobs distributing leaflets.  He said distributing leaflets required standing in streets for 8 hours when he would have mebelieve that he had difficulty standing or walking for 15 â 20 minutes.
