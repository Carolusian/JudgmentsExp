</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 10 March 2005, Mr Ng, together with Mr Choy Bing Wing as co-plaintiff, commenced the present action against 4 defendants.  The1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants (âCRHâ and âMax Shareâ respectively) were also the defendants/ respondents in FACV 5/2004 where the Court of FinalAppeal made the RPO, whereas the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants (âCREâ and âthe SFCâ respectively) are new parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr Ng did not seek leave from me or Lam J or indeed any other judge of this court pursuant to paragraph 4 of the RPO, before hecommenced the present action together with Mr Choy.  The action has since been brought to my notice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Issues before the Court</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Amongst the questions before me are whether the present action commenced by Mr Ng falls within the specified class of proceedingsset out in paragraph 3 of the RPO, and if it does, whether the action should be permitted to continue or should be dismissed as perparagraph 8 of the RPO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendants naturally contend that the present action by Mr Ng is caught by paragraph 3 of the RPO and moreover, it should notbe permitted to continue.  Not only that, as Mr Choy is not a party to FACV 5/2004, and doubts have arisen as to whether the RPOprohibits <i>Mr Choy</i> from bringing the present action as co-plaintiff and whether the same may be proceeded with by <i>him</i> even if the court should be of the view that <i>Mr Ng</i> should not be permitted to continue with the action (as per paragraphs 3 and 8 of the RPO), the Defendants have also by summonsesapplied for a restricted proceedings order in terms similar to the RPO against Mr Choy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Although their summonses do not specifically say so, it is implicit in the Defendantsâ identical applications that they also applyfor the dismissal or stay of Mr Choyâs claim against them in this action, which as a matter of logical sequence, should precedea restricted proceedings order against Mr Choy â which really looks to the <i>future</i>.  That was also apparent from the evidence and written submissions filed by them before the hearing.

That was the abuse that prompted the Court of Final Appeal to makethe RPO.  That (i.e. re-litigation) is often the abuse that a court is faced with when it finds it necessary to consider making arestricted proceedings order against a plaintiff.  But that is <i>not</i> the only abuse that is imaginable.  A party is as much vexed by an opponent who repeatedly drags him to court for the same old subjectmatter that has been decided in previous proceedings between themselves, as by an opponent who, having lost in a previous piece oflitigation to him in relation to one subject matter, repeatedly drags him back to court in relation to some other frivolous or vexatiouscomplaints, which cannot be said to be the same subject matter that has been previously litigated on or a matter that could and shouldhave been raised in the previous action as per the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle (<i>Yat Tung Investment Co. Ltd v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581).</a>  From the perspective of the court, the court is no less vexed, and its limited valuable judicial resources drained, by new actionsthat seek to vex successful parties in previous litigation with spurious new matters that cannot be said to be the same as the oldsubject matters of litigation or matters caught by the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle, than by abusive proceedings that seek to re-litigate decided matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In those circumstances, if the new matter complained of in the new action is caught by the wide formulation in a restricted proceedingsorder, I do not see why the designated judge should turn a blind eye to the fact that the new matter so raised is frivolous or vexatiousor otherwise abusive, even though it is, strictly speaking, not the same as the old subject matter that has been adjudicatedon ora matter that could and should have been raised in the previous litigation as per the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle (which has been significantly narrowed down by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v. Gore Wood &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1</a> and other subsequent cases).  I do not see why in such a case, where the new action is caught by the wide formulation in the restrictedproceedings order, the designated judge should give leave to the commencement of the action or permission for the action to proceed,leaving it to the defendant to fend for himself, with its attendant waste of time and resources.  Whether the defendant applies tostrike out the claim or simply defends it in the normal way, the proceedings will entail a wholly unjustified drain on valuable yetinevitably limited judicial time and resources, which could otherwise be made available to genuine and <i>bona fide</i> litigants before the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In my judgment, the court and the designed judge should take a firm and robust, sensible, approach towards the question of leave/permission in relation to a restricted proceedings order.  When it comes to curbing vexatious proceedings and abuses of the courtâsown process, I see little place for technicalities and formalism that is devoid of substantive or procedural justification.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Of course, the above observations are made in the context that the new action is caught by the wide formulation in a restrictedproceedings order.  If it is not, the question of leave or permission to proceed does not arise in the first place.  However, ifit is caught by the wide formulation, I can see no justification for prolonging the vexation or abuse by granting leave or permissionto proceed, when by definition, the inevitable outcome is that the new claim will be struck out and/or the action dismissed (or stayed)upon subsequent application (or after trial).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Riberio PJ, in discussing the use of a wide formulation in a restricted proceedings order, said that some such wider formulationmight catch ânon-<i>abusive</i>â proceedings and in such cases the court âcouldâ be expected to grant leave for the new proceedings to proceed.  His Lordshipdid not say all new proceedings that did not involve an attempt to <i>re-litigate</i> a lost cause could be expected to be permitted to proceed.  Rather, his Lordship said that ânon-<i>abusive</i>â proceedings could be expected to be permitted to proceed.  Moreover, the learned judge only said that in such cases involvingnon-abusive proceedings, the court â<i>could</i>â be expected to grant leave for the new proceedings to proceed.  Quite obviously, the learned judge was leaving it to the unfettereddiscretion of the designated judge to determine whether to grant leave in accordance with the actual circumstances of the case thathe or she might have to face.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I am not, by my above observations, extending the scope of a restricted proceedings order beyond its intended ambit.  Any such suggestionbegs the question of what the intended ambit of a restricted proceedings order is.  As I said, while re-litigation is a common typeof abuses faced by the court, it is by no means the only known type of abuses.  Other types of abuses may also call for the makingof a restricted proceedings order.  Moreover, although a particular restricted proceedings order may have its genesis in a particulartype of abuses, its ambit of operation need not be directed towards that particular type of abuses only.  One of the functions ofa wide formulation in a restricted proceedings order is precisely to draw the boundary of the ambit of operation of the order.  Thatboundary has to be justified by the facts and evidence that have been placed before the court making the restricted proceedings orderand the courtâs judgment (based on the facts and materials before it as well as the inferences that it can draw from the same)on what the vexatious litigant might do in future.  However, once the boundary is drawn, it settles the ambit of the order.  I failto see anything wrong for the designed judge to require an arguably meritorious claim to be present before giving leave/permissionto the commencement or continuation of the new action that falls within the boundary so drawn.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Striking-out of the courtâs own motion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In this regard, it is important also not to forget that in the courtâs arsenal of weapons against attempts to abuse its own processis the power to strike out a claim <i>on its own motion</i>.  Order 18 rule 19(1), the Rules of the High Court (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>), providing for the courtâs power under the statutory rules to strikeout pleadings and indorsements, does not specifically require the application of a party as a pre-condition to the courtâs exerciseof its power.  Rather it provides that the court âmay at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck outâ any pleadings basedon the usual grounds â including that the claim is frivolous or vexatious and that it is otherwise an abuse of the process of thecourt, and order the stay or dismissal of the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Moreover, apart from the statutory power to strike out, there is also the parallel power under the inherent jurisdiction of thecourt to strike out or stay proceedings before it, which are obviously frivolous or vexatious, or are otherwise an abuse of processof the court.  In fact, the power to make a restricted application order or a restricted proceedings order stems from the same inherentjurisdiction of the court to protect its own process from abuses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Further, whether under the statutory power or the inherent jurisdiction to strike out, the court may consider exercising its poweron its own motion, even in the absence of any application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The position has also been explained by <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</i>, vol. 1, para. 18/19/12, which points out that from time to time such power to strike out has been exercised by the court in personalinjuries cases of its own motion:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">âThe current personal injuries Judge, Seagroatt J considers that this is a much misunderstood provision and is often overlookedin practice. In personal injury actions, particularly running down and employerâs liability actions, many accidents are so self-evidentlythe consequence of negligence on the part of the defendant that no sensible defence can be maintained. Where there is no plea ofcontributory negligence, or no evidence of it, or where such a contention is manifestly contrary to common sense and known principlesof law, the court has power to strike out the defence and enter judgment accordingly, even in the absence of a specific applicationby the plaintiff. Further the inherent jurisdiction of the court enables it to make decisions for the economic, expeditious and justdisposal of actions. Spurious defences such as tactical or holding defences, are regarded as wasting costs, causing the parties toprepare cases on liability where there can be no such issue. This involves use of court time and resources as well as the use ofpublic funds and resources in cases where the Legal Aid Department, Department of Justice, Labour Department and Police Force areconcerned.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">See also <i>Lam Kai v.

It is true that in paragraph 57 (at page 494H), his Lordship referred to the need for the party being vexedby the abusive proceedings to make an application to strike out and for the court to entertain an <i>inter partes</i> hearing before the abuse can be brought to an end by a strike-out order.  There, I believe his Lordship was focusing on the normaltype of situations where the court deals with an application to strike out.  As I have sought to demonstrate above, the power tostrike out has been exercised on the courtâs own motion, even in the absence of a specific application, provided that a fair opportunityto be heard has been afforded to the party affected.  As has been pointed out by Earl of Selborne LC in <i>Metropolitan Bank v. Pooley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2010%20AC%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 10 App. Cas.  210</a>, the power to strike out or stay a manifestly vexatious suit which is plainly an abuse of the authority of the court is âinherentin the jurisdiction of every Court of Justice to protect itself from the abuse of its own procedureâ (at page 214).  As the protectionof the courtâs own procedure and interest is at stake, it seems to me that the exercise of the power to strike out or to stay theabusive proceedings so as to protect the courtâs own procedure and interest cannot be dependent upon the making of an applicationby the opposite party.  The court must have, as part of its inherent jurisdiction to protect itself from the abuse of its own procedure,the power to act on its own motion.  Of course, the power must be exercised carefully and resorted to only in exceptional circumstanceswhere it is a plain and obvious case of abuse.  But that is quite another matter distinct from the one under discussion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In the courtâs combat against abusive proceedings brought by vexatious litigants, not only should the court be flexible in developingremedies which are proportionate to the abuse that has to be dealt with in exercising its statutory and inherent jurisdiction (paragraph6 of Li CJâs judgment in <i>Ng Yat Chi</i> at page 482A-C), <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i>, it should also have no hesitation in putting to best and most efficient use of existing weapons already in its possession to preventor curb abuses of process.  Amongst others, the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to strike out on the courtâs own motion, evenin the absence of a specific application, should be resorted to unhesitantly, where appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Of course, before the court should decide to exercise its power to strike out, a fair opportunity must be given to the potentiallyaffected litigant to be heard.  But subject to that procedural safeguard, I am of the view that the court clearly has the power tostrike out a frivolous or vexatious claim or proceedings that are an abuse of the process of the court, on its own motion, and inthe absence of a specific application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  That being the case, I fail to see why a designated judge must give leave or permission for an abusive claim to be commenced orproceed, which is caught by the wide formulation in a restricted proceedings order that has its genesis in an attempt to re-litigatean old matter, if the new claim does not involve an attempt to re-litigate but is otherwise abusive.  As a matter of substance, notgiving leave/permission is the same as striking out the claim of the courtâs own motion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  If I am wrong and a designated judge must adopt a compartmentalised or blinkered approach to the question of leave and permission,I would venture to suggest that he or she could consider, <i>at the same juncture</i> of his or her giving leave/permission to commence/continue the abusive claim, exercising the courtâs undoubted power to strikeout the claim, provided that a fair opportunity to be heard should first be given to the vexatious litigant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  So much for the principles.  They have been discussed in some detail because questions have been raised in the present case as to(a) whether the new action commenced by Mr Ng, though caught by the wide formulation used in paragraph 3 of the RPO, is in substancean attempt to re-litigate old matters; (b) if the answer is ânoâ, whether it is otherwise abusive so that the court should nonethelessnot permit the same to proceed, and (c) if the permission has to be granted, whether there is really nothing that the court can ofits own motion do about the situation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Claim in the present case</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On the face of it, Mr Ngâs and Mr Choyâs complaint in the present action is as follows: The shares in CRE are owned by Max Sharethrough a nominee (CSA?).  However, that fact has been concealed in the reports and financial statements of Max Share for the years1992 to 2003.  Furthermore, CRE itself has since 1992 continuously made âfalse representationsâ to the public that its holdingcompany was and is CRH (rather than Max Share).  As CRE has been declaring dividends on its shares, the above concealment and misrepresentationshave served to enable dividends that should have been received by Max Share as shareholder to be âembezzledâ or otherwise misappropriated. âCorporate fraudsâ have thus been committed.  Furthermore, there has been an attempt (that has been thwarted by Mr Ng and MrChoy) to dispose of Max Shareâs shareholding in CRE in the United States in the name of CRH.  The SFC has aided and abetted thecorporate Defendants to cheat the public and Mr Ng and Mr Choy in the concealment of the alleged frauds and by failing to order thesuspension of trading of CREâs shares in the stock market.  Mr Ng and Mr Choy thus claim damages against the Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  At the hearing, Mr Choy told the Court in no uncertain terms that this is not a derivative action.   Rather he and Mr Ng rely onthe cause of action of intentional interference with economic interests (or deceit).  They personally claim damages for the tort.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  On a superficial reading of the pleading, the claim does not turn on the validity of the share capital increase of Max Share in1992, the subject of re-litigation that gave raise to the RPO in the first place.  Whether Mr Ng legally (and Mr Choy beneficially)own 49% or 0.38% (after the increase in share capital) in the share capital of Max Share does not affect the substance of the claimin the sense that dividends due to Max Share (as per the matters pleaded in the statement of claim) have been misappropriated, andas Max Shareâs shareholder Mr Ng (as trustee for Mr Choy) has thus suffered a financial loss â whether that would give rise toa personal action in tort is quite another matter.  Furthermore, Mr Choy has in his 9<sup>th</sup> affirmation claimed that the subject matter of complaint only came to his knowledge shortly before the commencement of the presentaction â presumably he speaks for Mr Ng as well; in other words, it was not a matter that could and should have been raised inthe earlier proceedings, particularly the winding-up proceedings (HCCW 321/1996) where a number of complaints of misconduct had beenlevelled against CRH and those behind it, and thus the wider principle of issue estoppel under <i>Yat Tung</i> does not apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Present claim is an attempt to re-litigate in disguise</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In my judgment, on closer examination, the present action <i>is</i> an attempt to re-open the question of validity of the share capital increase in 1992 or a collateral attack against the courtâsconclusion in relation to the validity of the same that has been reached in the previous proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  <i>First</i>, paragraph 2 specifically pleads the shareholdings in Max Share.  It refers to the 1992 share capital increase as a âpurportedâincrease only.  It therefore raises an issue on the validity of the 1992 share capital increase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  <i>Second</i>, Mr Ng and Mr Choy sue for damages based on the tort of intentional interference, as per Mr Choyâs submission.  The pleading isplainly defective in that loss and damage have not been particularised.  Leaving that aside, it is plain that the quantum of damagesâ assuming for the sake of argument that the cause of action is viable â will depend on Mr Ngâs percentage of shareholdingin Max Share.  Given the way paragraph 2 of the statement of claim has pleaded the shareholdings in Max Share and its reference tothe 1992 increase in share capital as merely a âpurportedâ increase, and in the absence of any express and specific disclaimerby Mr Ng and Mr Choy that their claim is by reference to Mr Ngâs 0.38% shareholding in Max Share only, one can only conclude thatthe claim for damages is again an attempt to re-litigate the validity of the 1992 increase in share capital through the backdoor. Put another way, the claim for damages will raise immediately the issue of Mr Ngâs percentage of shareholding in Max Share.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  <i>Third</i>, it should be remembered that in the winding-up proceedings commenced in 1996 and tried in 2000, Mr Ng (holding his shares as barenominee for Mr Choy) made a number of complaints of misconduct and misappropriation of assets against his fellow shareholder, CRH. The latest complaint of misconduct and misappropriation of assets allegedly belonging to Max Share against CRH is plainly a matterof similar nature, and if it was known to Mr Ng (or Mr Choy) at the time when the winding-up petition was still on, on the materialsbefore the court, there would be no reason why Mr Ng should not have raised it in the winding-up proceedings, bearing in mind thatthe alleged concealment complained of in the present action spanned 13 years, from 1992 to 2003.  It was not so raised, and the onlyexplanation given â and given by Mr Choy only â was that âthe deception was only discovered by the Plaintiffs shortly beforecommencement of [the present action]â (paragraph 2 of Mr Choyâs 9<sup>th</sup> affirmation).  The only evidence Mr Choy relied on in support of his assertion was a letter he wrote to the Chief Judge of the HighCourt on 15 June 2005 where he made the same bare assertion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I note that Mr Ng himself has not gone on oath to say anything.  He has not even bothered to appear before this Court at the hearing. So far as the position of Mr Ng is concerned, in my view it is for him to persuade the Court, given my conclusion that the actionis caught by the wide formulation in paragraph 3 of the RPO, that the new action is not an attempt to re-litigate a lost cause ora matter that could and should have been raised in the previous proceedings under the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle, as per paragraph 120(a) of the judgment of Riberio PJ already reproduced above.  The burden is on him to satisfy the designatedjudge of the (arguable) merits of his new claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I am far from persuaded by the bare allegation of Mr Choy (none came from Mr Ng) that the two of them only discovered the allegedconcealment and deception âshortly beforeâ the commencement of the present action on 10 March 2005.  In my judgment, not onlyis such a bare assertion wholly inadequate, it is also contradicted by the correspondence emanating from Mr Ng and Mr Choy themselves,which have been referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the statement of claim and have been placed before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The correspondence clearly shows that Mr Ng and Mr Choy were aware of the alleged concealment and deception well before the commencementof the present action in March 2005.  Thus, for instance, in Mr Choyâs letter dated 22 April 2003 that he wrote to the Chief Justiceof the Court of Final Appeal, he said â</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%"

Mr Ng and Mr Choy have said so in terms in their correspondence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Indeed in Mr Ngâs and Mr Choyâs long letter dated 16 September 2003 to various securities authorities and the New York stockexchange, they alleged that âMSL [i.e. Max Share] is 49% owned by Ng Yat Chi and 51% owned by CRHC [i.e. CRH]â (paragraph 3.1)and went on to complain bitterly about the âfraudulentâ judgments of the courts in Hong Kong by which their initial success inthe winding-up proceedings before the trial judge was reversed on appeal and the validity of the 1992 share capital increase upheld.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Patently paragraphs 6 to 8 of the statement of claim seek to re-open a lost cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  As Riberio PJ has anticipated in paragraph 120(a) of his judgment reproduced above, spurious new elements may be introduced intothe new action, perhaps hoping to disguise the fact that it is in reality no more than an attempt at re-litigation.  Paragraph 13(b)of the latest Practice Direction on restricted application orders and restricted proceedings orders (Practice Direction 11.3 dated18 March 2005:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20HKLRD%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 HKLRD 548</a>, 552G-J) gives a similar warning.  Judging on the materials before the Court, I have no doubt whatsoever that as a matter of <i>substance</i>, the present action is an attempt by Mr Ng and Mr Choy to re-litigate a lost cause, or matters that could and should have been raisedin the earlier proceedings within the meaning of the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Addition of three new parties irrelevant</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Having come to the conclusion that in substance, the present action is an attempt in disguise to re-litigate a lost cause or mattersthat could and should have been raised in the earlier proceedings, the fact that three new parties are involved in the present actionthat were not parties to FACV 5/2004 where the RPO was made or the other proceedings mentioned in paragraph 3 of the RPO is neitherhere nor there, as again has been anticipated by Riberio PJ in paragraph 120(a) of his judgment.  In any event, CRE was actuallyreferred to in paragraph 14 of the statement of claim in HCA 2039/2002, which led to FACV 5/2004 and was one of the proceedings specifiedin paragraph 3 of the RPO.  The joinder of CRE as a co-defendant in the present action does not save it from being caught by theRPO at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  As regards the SFC, its alleged liability in the present action is parasitic on the claim against the other defendants.  It is saidto have âaided and abettedâ the other defendants in their alleged wrong-doings.  The joinder of the SFC as a defendant does notalter the true nature and substance of the present action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As regards Mr Choy as co-plaintiff, as will be discussed below, his presence does not affect the question of whether Mr Ngâs claimis caught by the RPO or should be permitted to continue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">No merits in Ngâs claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Having come to the above conclusion, I need to apply the arguably meritorious test set out in the judgment of the Court of FinalAppeal.  There can be only one answer.  The present action is plainly unarguable and wholly devoid of merit.  As I already concludedabove, it seeks to re-litigate a matter that was or could and should have been raised and dealt with in the previous proceedings. That amounts to an abuse of the process of the court.  There are no exceptional circumstances justifying the re-opening of the matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Furthermore, the statement of claim as a pleading is hopelessly defective.  Serious allegations of fraud are made against the Defendants,including the SFC.  The material facts pleaded are vague and not easy to understand.  More objectionably, the requisite particularsof the Plaintiffsâ case on fraud are wholly missing, contrary to the specific requirement under Order 18 rule 12(1) of the Rulesof the High Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Last but not the least, the claim against the SFC is equally unsustainable and bad.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Abuses must be stopped as soon as possible</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  But not only that.  The present claim is plainly an abusive one in every sense of the word.  It is a culmination of a whole seriesof correspondence that preceded its commencement, to which the pleading specifically refers.  The correspondence contains countlesswholly unjustified and unfounded allegations and abuse levelled at the court leaders as well as members of the Judiciary involvedin hearing the previous litigations.  The correspondence was copied or purportedly copied to authorities and persons holding highpositions not only in Hong Kong, but also in the Mainland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Mr Choy went so far in hisoral submission before this Court as to suggest that the âdisclosureâ by him of the alleged embezzlement of dividends in questionin the correspondence that was purportedly copied to, amongst others, the President as well as the Premier of the Peopleâs Republicof China led to the âdownfallâ of the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR.  The suggestion is no doubt absurd.  But moreimportantly for our present purposes, that highlights the need to stop all these abuses and nonsense as soon as possible. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Ngâs claim not permitted to proceed</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In those circumstances, I have come to the firm conclusion that the claim made by Mr Ng against the Defendants in the present actionis totally devoid of merit and is indeed abusive.  I therefore refuse to grant permission to Mr Ng to continue with his claim inthe action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  If I had concluded that the present claim is not an attempt to re-litigate old matters, for the reasons explained above, I wouldstill have applied the arguably meritorious test and refuse permission to continue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Alternatively, Ngâs claim should be struck out</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Alternatively, if I am wrong and  â (a) the present action is not an attempt by Mr Ng to re-litigate a matter that was or couldand should have been raised and decided in the earlier proceedings, <i>and</i> (b) in that event the designated judge has no discretion to look into the merits of the claim but must permit the claim to proceed,I would without hesitation exercise the courtâs undoubted power both under the statutory rules and its inherent jurisdiction tostrike out the pleading and dismiss the claim as being an abusive one.   I have already explained above that even leaving aside thequestion of re-litigation and <i>Yat Tung</i>, the present claim as formulated is plainly bad and unsustainable.  It is an abusive claim.  I will not repeat myself here.  Forthat reason, the pleading should be struck out and the claim dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Position of Choy vis-Ã -vis the RPO</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Turning to the position of Mr Choy, there is no need to decide whether the RPO made by the Court of Final Appeal in FACV 5/2004to which Mr Choy was not a party is binding on him as such, so that he cannot commence the present claim without first getting theleave of the court to do so.  Arguments to that effect have been advanced by the Defendants in the present action, principally onthe ground that ever since the acquisition of Mr Ngâs shares in Max Share by Mr Choy back in 1992, Mr Ng has been holding the sharesas bare trustee for Mr Choy, as Max Share has refused to register Mr Choy as shareholder.  This has been indeed Mr Choyâs own argumentbefore the Court of Appeal in <i>Ng Yat</i> <i>Chi</i> <i>v. Max Share Ltd</i> (CACV 252/1996)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20HKLRD%20663" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] HKLRD 663</a>, 666 H/I, and remains his contention in this action as per paragraph 2.3 of the statement of claim.  Thus the argument runs thatthe RPO imposed by the Court of Final Appeal against Mr Ng is in truth and in substance a restricted proceedings order made againstMr Ng as trustee for Mr Choy as beneficiary at whose direction Mr Ng must have brought the previous proceedings.  I can see muchforce in the argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On the other hand, I bear in mind the consideration that a court order, particularly an order of the present type, must be clearand unambiguous.  As Mr Choy has not been named in the RPO, nor did he have an opportunity to address the Court of Final Appeal whetherin person or by representation, I can see the counter argument that he is not bound by the RPO as such â particularly consideringthat whilst the fact that Mr Ng had prosecuted the various previous proceedings, including those before the Court of Final Appealin FACV 5/2004, for the benefit of Mr Choy, was well-known to the Court of Final Appeal itself, it however did not see fit to namespecifically Mr Choy in the RPO that it made.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  As I say, I do not need to decide this interesting but academic point, because I have come to the view that (a) the present claimby Mr Choy should be struck out as being an abuse of the process of the court for the same reasons that I have given above in relationto Mr Ngâs claim, and (b) a similar restricted proceedings order should be made against Mr Choy personally.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">No merits in Choyâs claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In relation to the first point, what I have said in relation to Mr Ngâs claim applies equally to Mr Choyâs.  So far as re-litigationand the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle is concerned, as beneficiary suing by his trustee (Mr Ng), Mr Choy is as much bound by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> as well as the wider doctrine in <i>Yat Tung</i>, as Mr Ng himself: see <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ed. re-issue), vol. 16(2), para. 1004; <i>Re</i> <i>Defries</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2048%20LT%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 48 LT 703.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Leaving <i>re-litigation</i> and <i>Yat Tung</i> aside, the same criticisms against the claim pleaded in the statement of claim that have been pointed out in relation to the positionof Mr Ng apply equally to the claim pleaded by Mr Choy as co-plaintiff in the same statement of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Choyâs claim, like that made by his co-plaintiff Mr Ng, is plainly bad.  His pleading should be struck out and his action dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">A new restricted proceedings order against Choy</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  As regards the making of a new restricted proceedings order against Mr Choy, it cannot be argued otherwise that Mr Choy was andis the main instigator behind all the previous proceedings as well as the present action.  Not only is Mr Ng merely a bare trusteeholding no beneficial interest in the shares, the court records as well as the correspondence and documents concerned all bear witnessto the fact that Mr Choy was and is the prime mover behind all the proceedings that have been seen by the courts thus far.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Even without making any reference to what has happened in the present action and the correspondence preceding its commencement,it is clear that in the previous proceedings identified in paragraph 3 of the RPO, all the reasons that have been given for the makingof the RPO against Mr Ng by the Court of Final Appeal in FACV 5/2004 apply equally, if not with greater force â bearing in mindthat Mr Choy was in fact the main instigator behind Mr Ng â to Mr Choy.  See in particular paragraph 51 of Ribeiro PJâs judgment(at p. 493A to C).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  And if the present action as well as the correspondence preceding its commencement are taken into account as well, the picture cannotbe clearer.  Many of the blatantly abusive letters that have been written were penned by Mr Choy himself.  After action was commenced,many of the letters and most of the responses in relation to whether the present action is caught by the RPO and whether permissionshould be given for it to continue were written or made by Mr Choy himself.  Mr Choy has filed no less than 11 affirmations in thisaction.  Furthermore, as a common hallmark of vexatious litigants and abusive proceedings and applications, an application was madeby Mr Choy alone to disqualify and discharge me from hearing the present matter.  The application, which was made on spurious grounds,was duly dismissed by me, for which I have handed down a separate reasons for judgment in open court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  By way of contrast, Mr Ng has not put in any affirmation in this action, and has made little if any substantive response of hisown in relation to the issues arising out of the RPO against him.  He did not join Mr Choy in his application by motion to dischargeme from hearing the case and indeed, as I mentioned above, he did not even bother to appear before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The inescapable conclusion is that Mr Choy is the main instigator behind the present action and the preceding correspondence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  All this is more than sufficient to justify the imposition of a restricted proceedings order against Mr Choy personally coveringall previous proceedings covered by paragraph 3 of the RPO made by the Court of Final Appeal against Mr Ng, as well as the presentaction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The fact that formally, this is only the first time that Mr Choy is suing in his own name (leaving aside the winding-up proceedingsin which Mr Choy was at one stage a co-petitioner) does not make any difference.  As a matter of substance, he has been involvedin all the previous proceedings.  In my judgment, it is important to look at substance rather than form, and to assess the probabilitiesof a vexatious litigant seeking to bring further vexatious proceedings in future after the dismissal or stay of his current action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">No wavier of RPO</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Choy argued that the Defendants had taken steps in the present action after service of the writ of summons on them, and had therebywaived their rights or protection under the RPO, or are otherwise estopped from seeking protection under it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  There are quite a number of good answers to this argument.  I would only mention one, which is, from the perspective of the court,amongst the most important ones.  A restricted proceedings order is not there only to protect innocent parties from wholly unmeritoriousclaims made by vexatious litigants, or vexatious proceedings.  It is made also for the protection of the court against wholly unwarranteddrain of its valuable yet limited judicial time and resources.  Furthermore, it safeguards the public interest in having genuinelitigations dealt with and adjudicated upon by the court without undue delay.  A drain on the Judiciaryâs time and resources byvexatious litigants and proceedings is a loss to the genuine litigants in terms of the courtâs handling of their proceedings. There is a much wider public interest perspective to restricted application orders and restricted proceedings orders than the personalinterests of the immediate parties to vexatious or abusive proceedings, important though they themselves are or may be.  RiberioPJ has explained the public interest dimension of abusive proceedings in paragraphs 52 and 53 of his judgment in <i>Ng Yat Chi</i> (at page 493C/D to J).  See also paragraph 4 of the judgment of Li CJ in <i>Ng Yat Chi</i> (at page 481F to G/H).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Thus analysed, it can be plainly seen that the protection afforded in a restricted proceedings order cannot be  âwaivedâ bya party to abusive proceedings brought subsequently to the order.  The courtâs as well as the publicâs interests are at stake. The court has its own process to protect against abuses.  The protection afforded by a restricted proceedings order to the courtâsown process cannot be waived by any party to a subsequent abusive litigation or proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I reject Mr Choyâs argument. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">A further restricted proceedings order against Ng</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  For similar reasons, not only do I as designated judge not permit the claim of Mr Ng in the present action to continue (paragraph8 of the RPO order), I also make a new restricted proceedings order against <i>Mr Ng</i> covering the present action specifically (for the avoidance of doubt â as the RPO, for obvious reasons, did not include the presentaction in paragraph 3 thereof ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Suing as co-plaintiff</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In the present case, Mr Ng and Mr Choy sue as co-plaintiffs.  As the RPO, at least on the face of it, only covers Mr Ng, that gaverise to difficulties on the part of the Defendants in that understandably they (i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants) did not find it safe to simply ignore the action and file no acknowledgement of service (as definitely would and shouldhave been the case as per paragraph 10 of the RPO if Mr Ng <i>alone</i> were suing), apparently for fear that Mr <i>Choy</i> might seek to enter default judgment against them if no acknowledgement of service was filed.  Instead they were forced to take stepsto respond to the action, and besides the expenditure of time and costs, that gave rise to Mr Choyâs argument of waiver.  (As forthe SFC, it was not aware of the RPO at all until sometime after taking some steps in the action.)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The procedural difficulties that have thus arisen have been described in Lam Jâs judgment given on 13 May 2005, in which his Lordshipgave some guidance for handling similar situations in future: see paragraph 16.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  In order to prevent the same problem from arising again, in the restricted proceedings orders against Mr Ng and Mr Choy that I amgoing to make, I would specifically make all new proceedings, whether commenced by them as the sole plaintiff or as a co-plaintiff,subject to the leave/permission requirement, so as to ensure that the defendant(s) in those proceedings need not respond to themat all unless and until leave/permission is given (or it is directed that leave is not required). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I am not suggesting that this should be a standard requirement for all restricted proceedings orders.  Obviously the question dependson the facts of each case.  But in the present case, on the facts, I find the imposition of such a requirement to be wholly justified. I do not think the right of anyone who should have any legitimate reason to commence a new action together with Mr Ng or Mr Choy(that may fall within the ambit of the restricted proceedings orders that I am going to make) will be unduly compromised or otherwiseaffected by my orders.  If the cause of action is several, such a person could always commence a separate action by himself in whichevent my orders will not affect his action at all.  If he has a joint cause of action with Mr Ng or Mr Choy, then I am afraid onthe facts and past history of the present case, the balance obviously lies in favour of making the new action that such a personmay commence jointly with Mr Ng or Mr Choy subject to the leave/permission requirement.  But even then, the safeguard to that co-plaintiffâsinterest is that the court could be expected to grant leave/permission to his claim if it is arguably meritorious and is not abusiveâ which is by no means unfair in the light of the courtâs jurisdiction to strike out an unmeritorious or abusive claim of itsown motion in any event.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Outcome</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In summary, I would order as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Pursuant to paragraph 8 of the RPO, permission to continue the claim by Mr Ng against the Defendants in the present action be refused,and the claim be dismissed instead.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">A further restricted proceedings order be made against Mr Ng in the same terms as paragraphs 3 to 10 of the RPO made by the Courtof Final Appeal, with the following changes: the order shall apply to all new proceedings to be commenced by Mr Ng whether as thesole plaintiff or a co-plaintiff; and the previous proceedings covered by the restricted proceedings order that I am making are theproceedings in the present action (HCA 424/2005).</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The statement of claim in this action, insofar as it is the pleading of Mr Choy, be struck out and his claim against the Defendantsin the present action dismissed on the ground that the same is an abuse of the process of the court.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">A restricted proceedings order be made against Mr Choy in the same terms as paragraphs 3 to 10 of the RPO made by the Court of FinalAppeal against Mr Ng with the following changes: the order shall apply to all new proceedings to be commenced by Mr Choy whetheras the sole plaintiff or a co-plaintiff; and the previous proceedings covered by the restricted proceedings order against Mr Choyare the proceedings in the HCCW No. 321 of 1996, HCA No. 2039 of 2002 and HCSD No. 22 of 2002 (i.e. the proceedings specified inparagraph 3 of the RPO) as well as HCA 424/2005 (i.e. the present action).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> giving the costs of the present action, including the costs of the Defendantsâ two respective summonses for a restricted proceedingsorder against Mr Choy, as well as the costs in all the other interlocutory proceedings that have been put on hold pending my decisionherein, to the Defendants against the two Plaintiffs, to be taxed on an indemnity basis if not agreed.
