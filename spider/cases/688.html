The issue is whether the defendants as members of the board of directorsof the company assumed personal responsibility for the contents of the announcement. If they did, and if the statements <em>were</em> made negligently, the plaintiff may well succeed in its action. If the defendants did not assume personal responsibility for thecontents of the announcement, that part of the plaintiff's case which is based on it will fail. The defendants say that the statementof claim does not contain any assertion of their assumption of personal responsibility and is accordingly defective.</p>    <p class="heading">The judgment below</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The judge, after a careful review of the law and of the contents of the statement of claim, held that the pleading <em>was</em> defective. He struck out paragraphs 7 to 14 of the statement of claim. Those paragraphs read as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"7. On Sunday 26th October 1997 the Defendants were present at a board meeting of Peregrine convened to discuss and deal with thewidespread rumours as to Peregrine's financial difficulties.</p>        <p class="quote">8. On 26th October the Defendants issued an announcement (the 'Announcement') and caused the same to be published in the press, includingThe South China Morning Post on the following day, Monday 27th October 1997. An extract of the text of the Announcement is reproducedas schedule 1 hereto though the Plaintiff will refer to and rely on the full text of the Announcement as necessary at trial.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">9. The Defendants made the Announcement and caused the same to be published with the intention of re-assuring and/or to representto, inter alia, Peregrine's shareholders that Peregrine was not in financial difficulty and that rumours of Peregrine's financialdemise were completely false.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">10. The Plaintiff will allege and/or ask the court to infer that the Defendants' purpose for making the Announcement and causing thesame to be published was that the Defendants intended and/or wished to influence and/or ensure that those involved with Peregrine,including then shareholders of Peregrine such as the Plaintiff, retained confidence in Peregrine and did not cease to be involvedwith Peregrine; which in the case of shareholders, such as the Plaintiff, involved an intention to dissuade shareholders from sellingtheir shares and/or an intention that shareholders should be persuaded to hold their shares in the medium term and at least untilthe next audited accounts of Peregrine were published.</p>        <p class="quote">11. In making the Announcement and/or causing the same to be published in the press, the Defendants undertook and/or owed a duty ofcare to and/or assumed a responsibility to and/or a relationship with, Peregrine's shareholders, including the Plaintiff, to ensurethat the contents of the Announcement were true and accurate and would not mislead Peregrine shareholders, including the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">12. The Defendants knew, or ought to have known and been aware of and/or contemplated, that then shareholders of Peregrine such asthe Plaintiff would be influenced by and place reliance on the accuracy and truthfulness of the contents of the Announcement in decidingwhether they should sell or retain their Peregrine shares in light of the said rumours.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><em>Particulars</em></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Pending discovery and/or interrogatories herein the Plaintiff relies, in addition to the wording of the Announcement itself, on thefollowing matters:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) Pending release of the audited accounts of Peregrine, the Defendants as executive directors and/or officers of Peregrine werein a privileged position to know and/or ascertain and comment upon the true financial position of the Peregrine group; outside shareholderswere not in such a position and hence it was more probable than not that reliance would be placed on the Announcement made by thePeregrine board, the Announcement being reasonably expected to contain the best source of information as to the true position ofPeregrine and its subsidiaries and/or guidance as to what to do at a time when rumours as to Peregrine's demise were rife;</p>            <p class="quote">(2) The Announcement was specifically addressed inter alia to Peregrine's shareholders;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(3) The Announcement was a formal one given by order of the Peregrine board, not comments made on a social occasion or in an informalcontext; and</p>            <p class="quote">(4) The defendants, unlike the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, attached no disclaimer of responsibility and/or liability forthe contents of the Announcement.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">13. In reliance on the truth of the facts and/or matters contained in the Announcement and induced thereby, the Plaintiff's boardresolved on 12 December 1997 to reclassify 3,750,000 shares in Peregrine to be held as a long term investment instead of sellingthose shares.</p>        <p class="quote">14. In breach of duty and/or negligently the Defendants gave misleading and false information in the Announcement and/or omitted togive information in the Announcement which made statements therein misleading."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(Particulars are given of the allegation in paragraph 14, but I need not read them.)</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is necessary to add only that the announcement contained no <em>express</em> assumption of personal responsibility. No such statement as "The directors collectively and individually accept full responsibilityfor the accuracy of the information contained in this announcement" is to be found in it.</p>    <p class="heading">The defendants' case</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The case for the four defendant directors is that this announcement was an announcement made for <em>the company.</em> The defendants say that it is not pleaded against them that it was an announcement for which they assumed personal responsibility.They say that, even if it had been so pleaded, the plea would be bound to fail, since it is plain and obvious, reading the announcement,that it was made for the company alone.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In my judgment, the judge was wrong to strike out those paragraphs of the statement of claim which I have set out above. As it seemsto me, this announcement was indeed made for the company; but that does not exclude the possibility that it was an announcement madein terms from which it can properly be inferred that the defendants <em>were</em> assuming personal responsibility for its contents.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> As was pointed out by Seagroatt, J. in the course of the argument, paragraph 11 does contain an averment that, in causing the announcementto be published, the defendants assumed the responsibility to Peregrine shareholders to ensure that the contents of the announcementwere true and accurate. The suggestion, in these circumstances, that the statement of claim does not sufficiently plead that theannouncement was one for which the directors are said to have assumed responsibility cannot be supported.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The other point that, even if pleaded (as I have concluded that it was), the plea will be bound to fail, since it is plain and obviousthat the announcement was one made for the company alone, cannot be supported either. It is, I think, not plain and obvious at all.I accept that, at the trial, the judge may well come to the conclusion in relation to this announcement that it was made for thecompany alone, without any assumption of personal responsibility on the part of the defendants. The absence of any such words as"The directors collectively and individually accept full responsibility" for the announcement is a pointer in the defendants' favour,and it is, of course, the law that directors will not be held liable for acts of the company of which they are directors unless theyare to be taken as having assumed personal responsibility for them. But these are matters which need to be considered by the trialjudge. It would, in my judgment, be wrong to drive the plaintiff from the seat of judgment on the sort of points taken today. Inmy judgment, the case for the plaintiff is adequately pleaded, and it is not one of which it can be said that it is bound to fail.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> For these reasons, I would allow this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Rogers, J.A. :</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This is an action in negligence for economic loss sustained because of alleged negligent misstatements. For such a cause of actionto subsist, there must be a special relationship. That is necessary because statements can be made on many occasions when they arenot intended to be relied upon, e.g. social occasions or other informal occasions. Furthermore, the damage which can result fromstatements might be far wider than the physical damage which is suffered from a normal negligent act; for those reasons, it has beenappreciated that in the case of statements alleged to give rise to an action in negligence, actionability depends upon a specialrelationship being established. The existence of a special relationship entails, amongst other things, that the statement was madefor a particular purpose known to the adviser that the adviser knew that the statement would be communicated to the advisee and itwas made in circumstances such as would be regarded by a reasonable man as one that was to be taken seriously and relied upon.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Liability for negligent misstatements is not a liability which arises from a tort of strict liability as in the case, for example,of copyright and patent infringement. In such cases, it is sufficient to show that the director was implicated by having authorisedor procured the act wherein the tort was committed. This is exemplified by what was said in cases such as <strong>Evans v. Spritebrand</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20WLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 W.L.R. 317</a> @ 329 and <strong>PLG Research Ltd. v. Ardon International Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20FSR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] F.S.R. 197</a> @ 238. In cases where it is sought to make a director liable for negligent misstatements said to have been made by a company, itis necessary to go further than showing authorisation or procurement because to show that the director himself had, in effect, allthe ingredients of the tortfeasor, in the language that has been used in the cases, it must be shown that he has assumed personalresponsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Turning to the pleadings in this case, the first point to be noted is that the allegation is that the Defendants issued an "Announcement"or made the statement which is relied upon. The Defendants are individuals and they all are members of the Board. In paragraph 8,it is said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"8. On 26th October the Defendants issued an announcement (the 'Announcement') and caused the same to be published in the press ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In paragraph 9, it is said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"9. The Defendants made the Announcement and caused the same to be published with the intention of re-assuring and/or to representto, inter alia, Peregrine's shareholders ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The kernel of the announcement is set out in the schedule of statement of claim. The full announcement has, indeed, been shown tous, but it is of significance to note that the schedule sets out, first of all, the circumstances in which the announcement cameto be made. Those circumstances were, in brief, that there were rumours circulating in the market that Peregrine had suffered severefinancial losses. It is then said that "In order to end these rumours and re-assure Peregrine's clients and counter parties, bankers,shareholders and employees, the Board of directors ("the Board") of Peregrine has decided to make this announcement ..." There areother references to the Board in that announcement which is set out in the schedule e.g. it is said that "the Board believes thatthese reserves are adequate" in respect of certain matters. The whole matter is summarised. There are two references to the Boardin the Summary . In paragraph 8 is said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Board confirms there are currently no discussions taking place with another party to acquire a substantial shareholding in Peregrineand that there is no substance in the rumour that Mr. Philip Tose may be leaving Peregrine."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> An analysis of that statement alone must show that, on the face of the matter, it was the Board making the statement, indeed it wouldseem that the final words of that paragraph could probably only have come from the member of the Board who happens to be the firstnamed Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Paragraph 9 states that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Board confirms that, save as disclosed in this announcement, it is not aware of any matter disclosable under the general obligationimposed by paragraph 2 of the Listing Agreement, which is or may be of a price sensitive nature."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It concludes that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Rumours of losses by Peregrine running into hundreds of millions of US dollars and of Peregrine's financial demise are completelyfalse."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The statement concludes that it was made by order of the Board of Peregrine Investment Holdings Limited. It is signed by the companysecretary, namely the 4th Defendant who also was, of course, a member of the Board.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> It seems to me, that it is clearly arguable that the statements in the Announcement were made by the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Fung, S.C., on behalf of the Defendants, has manfully argued that such an argument is not sustainable. In my view, it is an argumentwhich is clearly on its face sustainable that the Defendants made these statements. They were statements similar, I would suggest,to statements made in a prospectus. There is per force an argument that they were made to a clearly identifiable class of persons,namely the shareholders.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In my view, the pleading in paragraphs 8 to 12 of the Statement of Claim on that footing alone is sufficient. But I also agree withwhat Godfrey, J.A. has said that if it is regarded that this was a corporate statement, there is sufficient that has been pleadedfor it to be argued that the Defendants have undertaken personal responsibility in respect of the statements made in the Announcement.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In my view, this appeal should be allowed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Seagroatt, J. :</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> For the reasons given by my Lords, Godfrey and Rogers, J.J.A., I also would allow this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Gerald Godfrey)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Conrad Seagroatt)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Michael Thomas, S.C. &amp; Mr. Robert Whitehead (M/s.
