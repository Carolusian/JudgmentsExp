The Defendant thendelivered these items to her solicitors in Hong Kong and requested them to divide the items into three portions and deliver one ofthe portions to the Plaintiff.  It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff did not accept the personal property delivered to him.  TheDefendant then brought the personal property back to Shanghai.</p>    <p><b><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> </b>On 16 November 1998, the Defendant applied to the Shanghai court for the division of the Deceasedâs estate among the Plaintiff herein,the Defendant herein and Madam Zhou Guan Hua (å¨å è¯) ((1998) Lu Min Chu Zi No. 1936).</p>    <p><b><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> </b>It is not in dispute that the Shanghai court delivered its judgment (hereinafter âthe Shanghai Judgmentâ) on 16 August 2002, whichis binding on both parties.</p>    <p><b><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> </b>The items claimed under paragraph 14.1 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim herein are items which were ordered to be distributedto the Plaintiff under paragraph 3 of the Shanghai Judgment, which states as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>3.

This cause of action must be founded on the claimantâs ownership and/or right of possessionover the subject matter (i.e. the property in question).  There is no dispute that these rights are derived from the Shanghai Judgment,and the Plaintiff confirmed at the hearing that the alleged detinue related to the Defendantâs conduct subsequent to the ShanghaiJudgment.  The items being claimed by the Plaintiff will be referred to hereinafter as âthe Plaintiffâs chattelsâ.</p>    <p><b><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a></b> It is also not in dispute that the Plaintiff has the ownership and/or right of possession over the property which was distributedto him under the Shanghai Judgment, and those rights are derived from the Shanghai Judgment.</p>    <p><b><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> </b>The parties agree that, subsequent to the Shanghai Judgment, the Plaintiffâs solicitors and the Defendantâs solicitors enteredinto correspondence which included the letters referred to in paragraphs 4(1)-(3), (5)-(11) and (13)-(15) of the Plaintiffâs AmendedStatement of Claim.</p>    <p><b><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> </b>According to the Defendant, the property in question is still in the possession of the Shanghai lawyer engaged by the Defendant.</p>    <p><b><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> </b>At the Pre-Trial Review hearing before Her Honour Judge Marlene Ng on 28 August 2006, the parties agreed that the issues in the presentcase are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)        First Issue: After the Shanghai Judgment took effect, did the Plaintiff make any valid demand which is required to constitutea cause of action in detinue at law?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)        Second Issue: Under the Shanghai Judgment, did the Defendant have the duty and/or obligation to deliver the property inquestion to the Plaintiff on her own initiative and/or in Hong Kong?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)        Third Issue: Did the acts of the defendant and/or her agents after the Shanghai Judgment took effect constitute detinue?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)        Fourth Issue: Did the Defendant intend to wrongfully detain the property in question?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><b><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> </b>At the same Pre-Trial Review, Judge Ng granted a consent order giving leave to each party to call an expert in PRC law to give evidenceat trial, and such expert evidence was to be confined to the interpretation under PRC law of the order in the Shanghai Judgment requiringthe Defendant herein to deliver up the property within 30 days from the effective date of the Judgment.  This evidence relates tothe Second Issue referred to above, which arises from paragraph 4(d) of the Amended Defence, which pleads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Further or in the alternative, under the Shanghai Judgment, the Defendant did not have any duty and/or obligation to deliver the subjectproperty from Shanghai to Hong Kong.  The Plaintiff was required to collect [the subject property] by himself.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In these proceedings, the Plaintiff has filed a Report and a Supplemental Report of Professor Dong Li Kun (è£ç«å¤ææ) as expertevidence on PRC law in support of the Plaintiffâs arguments on the Second Issue, whereas the Defendant has filed a Report of ProfessorZhang Xian Chu (å¼µæ²åææ) in support of the Defendantâs arguments on the Second Issue.  These reports can be found in pages76-7 to 76-23 of the Trial Bundle.</p>    <p><b><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> </b>At trial, the Plaintiff gave evidence in court and was cross-examined by Counsel for the Defendant.  Professor Dong Li Kun, the Plaintiffâsexpert witness, failed to attend the hearing at the scheduled time and date on 10 January 2007.  The Plaintiff said that the expertwitness was for some unknown reason not permitted to pass through the Visa Control of the Immigration Department at the border. This notwithstanding, the Plaintiff elected to proceed with trial rather than having an adjournment and applied for an order thatthe Reports of his expert be admitted as evidence without the expert witness having to attend court.  The Defendant opposed the applicationpursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 47(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap. 8</a> of the Laws of Hong Kong.  Having considered the submissions of both parties, and in the interests of justice, I exercisedmy discretion to refuse the Plaintiffâs application for the following three reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The evidence of Professor Dong Li Kun was necessary and important, but crucial aspects of his opinion were hotly contestedby the Defendantâs expert.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The weight of the opinions expressed in the Reports of Professor Dong Li Kun would be substantially diminished, and such opinionswould be of limited value, if he did not adduce his Reports in court under oath and was not cross-examined on the aspects of hisopinions which were hotly contested by the Defendant.  By comparison, the Defendantâs expert witness would give his opinion evidenceon oath and be subject to cross-examination.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     It would be prejudicial to the Defendant if the Plaintiff were allowed to adduce the Reports of Professor Dong Li Kun withouthis having to attend court and be cross-examined on his opinions whereas the Defendantâs expert witness would have to be cross-examinedon his views which were disputed by the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><b><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> </b>In the face of the above decision, the Plaintiff was left with no expert evidence in support of his arguments on the Second Issue.</p>    <p><b><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> </b> The Defendant elected not to testify in court. She relied on documentary evidence in support of her case and relied on the evidenceof her expert witness Professor Zhang Xian Chu in support of her arguments on the Second Issue.</p>    <p><b><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> </b>Having set out the background and preliminary matters as above, I shall deal with my findings on each of the issues.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The First Issue</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is beyond dispute that a claim in detinue âlay at the suit of a claimant having a right to immediate possession for the wrongfuldetention of his chattelâ (<i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (19<sup>th</sup> Ed), page 1005, para. 17-03).  The same passage goes on to state that â[t]he wrongful detention was normally, though not invariably,evidenced by the defendantâs refusal to deliver [the detained property] up on demand â¦â.  Hence, a fundamental issue in thepresent case is whether the Plaintiff made a legally valid demand.  The Plaintiffâs claim rests upon the basis that the Defendantunreasonably refused his demands (paragraph 4 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, at page 39-3 of the Trial Bundle).</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The First Issue arises from paragraph 4(c) of the Amended Defence, which pleads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>However, the Defendant denies that the relevant correspondence of the Plaintiff could constitute a legally valid demand and henceconstitute a cause of action in detinue.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Therefore, I have to determine whether the Plaintiff issued an effective demand on the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The demands that the Plaintiff allegedly made on the Defendant are set out in paragraph 4 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim. I shall now deal with each of the demands in the context of the underlying facts and taking into account the Defendantâs case andthe relevant submissions of Counsel for the Defendant.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Paragraph 4(1) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim refers to a letter dated 16 December 2004 from the Plaintiff to the Defendantâssolicitors in Hong Kong.  The letter stated: âPlease prepare [a Security Agreement] and present it for my signature by 18 December.â The request here was clearly not for the delivery up on demand of the possession of the chattels concerned.  It in fact relatedto a âSecurity Agreementâ to be prepared by the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong for the Plaintiffâs signature in orderto set-off the debt specified in a statutory demand issued against the Plaintiff in bankruptcy proceedings arising from the Plaintiffâsdefault in the payment of costs.  In his letter, the Plaintiff stated:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I hereby solemnly declare that, had the creditor disclosed the abovementioned security or guarantee in the âstatutory demandâ,the debtor would long ago have readily signed the agreement.  This position still has not changed, but regrettably âthe securityor guaranteeâ was disclosed too late, and time and costs have been wasted.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Please prepare the âsecurity agreementâ and present it for my signature by 18 December.  I believe this arrangement is beneficialto all parties and may save costs of the petition.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>However, the Defendant rejected the request.  In my view, this was not a demand for the delivery up of the chattels but rather wasa request to use the chattels as a charge or security for the debt of $16,694.35 specified in the statutory demand issued againstthe Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff was, in my view, requesting to use his chattels as a security for the debt in the statutory demand,rather than asking for his chattels back.  It follows that this request did not constitute a valid demand which was necessary forfounding an action for detinue. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The second demand is set out in paragraph 4(3) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  Here the Plaintiff refers to a letterthat he wrote to the Defendantâs then Shanghai lawyer with the following request:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Please immediately ask the Hong Kong solicitors acting for Weh Pih Stella (Rita Law &amp; Co.) to âdeliver upâ my personal propertyentrusted by Weh Pih Stella to you for âcustodyâ.  Upon receiving the written notice, I will go to the Hong Kong solicitors firmto go through the procedures for the collection of the property.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     The third purported demand is referred to in paragraph 4(6) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  Here the Plaintiff statesthat on 1 April 2005 he wrote to the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong seeking an update on the handling of the Plaintiffâschattels.  This letter, which can be found in page 286 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle, contains the following sentence:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Please provide me with an update on how âthe portion of Shanghai estate belonging to Mr Chow still under the custody of my Shanghailawyerâ is being handled.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>This did not constitute a demand as it merely inquired into the âwhereaboutsâ of the Plaintiffâs chattels.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     The fourth purported demand is referred to in paragraph 4(9) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  This is contained in aletter dated 5 April 2005 from the Plaintiff to the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer, which can be found in pages 288 to 290 of thePlaintiffâs Bundle.  The purported demand was in the following terms:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Please tell me: regarding the abovementioned 40 items of personal property that belong to me, what has your firm done on behalf ofyour client (Stella Pih) to comply with the 4<sup>th</sup> item of the civil judgment of (1998) Lu Min Chu Zi No. 1936, namely: âItem 3 of the judgment is to be delivered up by Weh Pih Stellawithin 30 days from the effective date of this judgmentâ?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>This request concerned the mode of compliance with the Shanghai Judgment, i.e. the mode of delivering the Plaintiffâs chattels pursuantto the terms of the Shanghai Judgment as stated in the letter.  This was essentially a question about the method of delivery and,strictly speaking, not a demand for delivery.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     The fifth purported demand, referred to in paragraph 4(11) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, is contained in a letterdated 14 April 2005 to the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer, a copy of which can be found in page 292 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle. The relevant passage in this letter is the 4<sup>th</sup> item, which reads as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>If your firm fails to directly account to me in accordance with the advice of the lawyer acting for Stella Pih, I will not hesitateto initiate proceedings against your client Stella Pih in the Hong Kong District Court in May, suing her for <u>wrongful detention of personal property</u>.  She will be asked to describe in the witness box the details of how she conspired with your firm to wrongfully take possessionof my property.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>This statement was in fact an ultimatum that if the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer did not directly âaccount to himâ by May 2005,the Plaintiff would commence legal proceedings in Hong Kong against the Defendant for detinue.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)     The sixth demand, referred to in paragraph 4(13) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, is contained in a letter dated 15 April2005 to the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong.  The letter contained a final warning in the following terms:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>If, by 30 April 2005, <u>Weh Pih Stella</u> still fails to deliver up item 3 of the civil judgment of (1998) Lu Min Chu Zi No. 1936, I will commence civil proceedings in theDistrict Court immediately.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the midst of these purported demands, on 26 April 2005 the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong replied to the Plaintiffâsletter dated 15 April 2005.  The reply contained the following passage:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>We understand that you have been in contact with Mr Zhu You Bin, the Shanghai lawyer who acts for Madam Stella Pih.  Regarding yourshare of the estate, you should follow up the matter with Mr Zhu.  We have advised you repeatedly to directly contact Mr Zhu, anddid provide you with Mr Zhuâs contact details on 4 April 2005.  Madam Pih <u>has never refused</u> to deliver to you that portion of the estate and has also provided you with contact details of her Shanghai lawyer through our firm(see the letter dated 4 April 2005).  Our client has instructed her Shanghai lawyer to handle the estate, and we fail to understandwhy you keep inquiring of us about matters relating to the estate instead of contacting the Shanghai lawyer to inquire about thecollection of the estate or other matters.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In its letter of 26 April 2005, Messrs. Rita Law &amp; Co, solicitors for the Defendant, requested the Plaintiff to contact the Defendantâslawyer in Shanghai.  The Plaintiff apparently did not do so before commencing the present legal action on 3 May 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> On this issue, Counsel for the Defendant argues that the demands of the Plaintiff did not constitute a valid demand at law becausethe Plaintiff was asking the Defendant to deliver the Plaintiffâs chattels to him in Hong Kong.  Details can be found in the Plaintiffâsletter to the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer whereby the Plaintiff demanded to have his  chattels delivered to the Defendantâs solicitorsin Hong Kong for onward delivery to him (see page 282 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle).  Similarly, in a letter dated 14 April 2005 tothe Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer (see page 292 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle) and a letter dated 15 April 2005 to the Defendantâssolicitors in Hong Kong (see page 293 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle), the Plaintiff requested the other party to deliver his chattelsto him in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Counsel for the Defendant refers to the case of <i>Capital Finance Co Ltd v. Bray</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%201%20WLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 1 WLR 323</a> in support of the proposition that the Defendant was not under a legal obligation to deliver the Plaintiffâs chattels to him inHong Kong.  The relevant principle is set out in Holding paragraph (2) in the headnote, which states as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)        That the demand was not a good one such as to found a claim in detinue.  No one is bound, save by contract, to take a chattelto the owner of it, his only obligation being not to prevent the owner from getting it when he comes for it.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The case involved a hire-purchase agreement of a motor vehicle.  The contract was protected by the Hire Purchase Act 1938, whichmeant that if the hirer had paid one-third of the total price, the owner could not take the car back unless the court ordered otherwise. The hirer, one Mr Bray, paid more than one-third of the total price but then defaulted on subsequent payments.  The finance company,as owner of the car, wrongfully terminated the contract and took the car back but subsequently returned it to the hirer.  A few monthslater, on 1 March 1963, the finance company acting through its solicitors wrote to the hirer, requesting him to return the car toone of the three designated addresses in Edinburgh and London by a specified date and demanding payment of all outstanding instalments. The hirer did not comply with the letter.  The owner commenced legal proceedings for the return of the car on the basis of the originalhire-purchase agreement.  By his defence, the hirer claimed that the owner had terminated the agreement by unlawfully repossessingthe car without a court order.  Shortly before the hearing in the County Court, the owner amended the claim by adding a claim indetinue and damages.  The County Court held that the owner could not rely on the hire-purchase agreement because it had unlawfullyterminated the agreement by taking possession of the car without a court order.  However, the Court held that when the hirer failedto return the car upon demand of the owner, a claim arose in detinue.  On appeal, the English Court of Appeal reversed the decisionof the trial judge and made the following ruling in the second paragraph on page 328 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>In my judgment, the letter of March 1 was not a sufficient demand to found a claim in detinue.  It was a demand to deliver up in accordancewith the hire-purchase agreement.  It demanded delivery up by Bray at his own expense to one of three named places, Edinburgh, WaterlooPlace in London, or Stone Building, Lincolnâs Inn.  But once the hire-purchase agreement was determined and not reinstated, Braywas under no obligation to take the goods to the finance company.  He could leave the goods at his house until the owner came tocollect them.  He would not be guilty of any unlawful detention unless, when the owner came to collect them, he prevented him takingpossession of them.  It is rather like the case, which was put in argument.  Suppose a trader leaves some article on my premisesâ it may be a photograph or even a grand piano â hoping I will buy it.  If I am unwilling to buy it, he cannot demand that Ipost the picture back to him or that I load the grand piano on a haulage contractorâs van and take it back to him.  I can leaveit where it is.  Or I can put it out of my way, if I like, without being guilty of any wrongdoing at all.  If he comes to collectit, I must let him have it: but that is all.  There is no obligation on a person who has another personâs goods to return themto him, except by contract.  This rule is accurately stated in <i>Salmond on Torts</i>, (18<sup>th</sup> ed.) at page 264: No one is bound, save by contract, to take âa chattel to the owner of it.  His only obligation is not to preventthe owner from getting it when he comes for it.â That has been the law ever since the case to which we were referred of <i>Clements v. Flight</i>.  The judgment of the court makes it quite clear, in order that there would be a wrongful detention of goods, the defendant mustwithhold the goods and prevent the plaintiff from having possession of them.  He is not bound to be active and send the goods backunless there is an obligation by contract to do so.  It seems to me, therefore, that this demand of March 1 1963, was not a gooddemand such as to found a claim in detinue.  It did not merely demand delivery up.  It demanded that the hirer should take the carback to one of these three addresses.  He was under no obligation to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (19<sup>th</sup> Ed), page 1015, para. 17-22, under the heading âConversion by keeping: demand and refusalâ, the learned authors stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The ordinary way of showing a conversion by unlawful retention of property is to prove that the defendant, having it in his possession,refused to surrender it on demand.  Indeed, such a demand is generally a precondition of the right of action for detention â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>It should be noted, however, that the defendantâs obligation is normally only to allow the claimant to collect the goods, not todeliver them to him.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The footnote to the above passage refers to <i>Capital Finance Co Ltd v. Bray</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%201%20WLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 1 WLR 323</a>, the authority cited by the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The Plaintiff sought to rely on the case of <i>Cranley v Hillary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281813%29%202%20M%20%26%20S%20120" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1813) 2 M. &amp; S. 120.</a>  In that case the defendant entered into a composition with his creditors including the plaintiff whereby he was to pay 8 shillingsin the pound on their respective debts and this sum was to be paid by two instalments to be secured by promissory notes to be givenby the defendant and payable on fixed dates.  The defendant was to assign to the creditors certain debts mentioned in the resolutionupon which the creditors should execute a general release.  The defendant and all other creditors executed the assignment of debtsand releases in performance of the resolution, but the plaintiff and his partner did not do so.  The plaintiff might have receivedhis promissory notes if he had applied for them, but there was no evidence that the defendant had given or tendered them to the plaintiff. In his judgment, Dampier J said that âthe obligor of a bond conditioned for payment of money at a particular day, is bound toseek the obligee, if he be in England, and at the set day to tender him the money, otherwise he shall forfeit the bond.  So in thiscase, the Defendant was to give the notes, and therefore to go with them to the Plaintiff, and he was not to go to the Defendant. Suppose the condition had been to pay a sum of money, I apprehend the Defendant must have sought out the party in order to pay it.â</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> It must be noted that <i>Cranley v. Hillary</i> is a case on the law of contract, specifically on the place of performance of a contract.  In <i>Chitty on Contract</i> (29<sup>th</sup> Ed), page 1235, para. 21-2005, the learned authors refer to the above case to support the principle that in relation to contractwhere the place of performance is not specified âeven by implication, but performance requires the concurrence of the promisee,the general rule is that the promisor must seek out the promisee and perform his promise wherever the promisee may beâ.  This principleis neither relevant nor applicable to the present case where the cause of action is detinue and the action is in tort.  The principlecited in <i>Capital Finance Co Ltd v. Bray</i> clearly applies to cases involving detinue.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Relying on <i>Capital Finance Co Ltd v. Bray</i>, Counsel for the Defendant submits that there was no legal obligation on the part of the Defendant to deliver the Plaintiffâs chattelsto him in Hong Kong as demanded by him, as she was not contractually obliged to do so. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Counsel for the Defendant submits that the Plaintiffâs demands for delivery of his chattels to him in Hong Kong were not good demandssuch as to found a claim in detinue and form the basis of the present action.  The Defendant was under no contractual obligationto deliver the Plaintiffâs chattel to him in Hong Kong.  As regards whether the Defendant was legally obliged under PRC law todo so pursuant to the Shanghai Judgment, I shall decide on this after I make my findings on the Second Issue with reference to theopinion evidence of the Defendantâs expert on the relevant PRC law.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Second Issue</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> This is an issue related to the law of the PRC.  The expertise of the Defendantâs expert, Professor Zhang Xian Chu, is not in dispute. In paragraph 3 of his Report (see page 65-6 of the Trial Bundle), Professor Zhang states that, âaccording to the judgment of theShanghai court, the place of âdeliveryâ should be Shanghaiâ.  He puts forward three reasons in support of his view:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>3.1       I have consulted a number of books but have not found any legal interpretation or judicial interpretation of the SupremePeopleâs Court concerning specific requirements of the place of delivery in succession cases.  However, I have reason to believethat, before it delivered its judgment, the Shanghai court had already ruled in the hearing at first and second instance on its jurisdiction,and all the parties had to attend the hearing in Shanghai.  Moreover, all the estate is in Shanghai. Therefore, unless otherwisespecified in the judgment, the place of delivery should obviously be Shanghai.  It defies judicial common sense to require a partyto make delivery in another place when there is no express term to that effect in the judgment of the court.  It is also unfair tothe party concerned.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3.2       The issue in the present case is not an academic debate on the concept of âdeliveryâ;,rather, it is about the âdeliveryâadjudged in an actual trial.  Concerning a âjudgment for deliveryâ, it is stated in <i>The Dictionary of PRC Law â Litigation Law</i> (the Editor-in-chief of which is Professor Chen Guang Zhong, who is an authority in PRC litigation law) that a judgment for deliveryis a civil judgment made by a Peopleâs Court requiring a particular party to fulfil the obligation of delivery imposed by the judgmentâ¦ only a judgment for delivery which takes legal effect is enforceable â¦ .   <i>The Dictionary of Law</i> (the Editor-in-chief of which is Zeng Qing Min) further points out that a special feature of a judgment for delivery is that oneof the parties undertakes a substantive obligation, and if the obligor fails to fulfil the obligation, the obligee can apply to thecourt for enforcement.  According to these authoritative legal interpretations, the crux of a âjudgment for deliveryâ is obviouslyfrom the interconnection between the judgment for delivery and the enforcement of delivery.  The court should not give a judgmentwhich it cannot or will not enforce.  The Supreme Peopleâs Court clearly states in its judicial interpretation that âan orderfor payment which takes legal effect is to be enforced by the Peopleâs Court which makes that orderâ.  Hence, it goes withoutsaying that the place of delivery under the judgment of the Shanghai court should be Shanghai.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3.3       In the present case, Shanghai is the place where the deceased Xu Zong Zhen lived at the time of her death and also the placewhere her estate is located.  Hence, the Shanghai court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the disputes of the parties as wellas jurisdiction to enforce the judgment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> During cross-examination, the Plaintiff sought to put to Professor Zhang Xian Chu that âArticle 88 of the PRC Civil Code providesthat where the place of performing the obligation is uncertain, the making of payment shall be performed at the location of the recipientâ¦ .  Hence, the place of delivery in the present case should be Hong Kong, not Shanghaiâ.  Professor Zhang stated that this waswrong for the following reasons:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Firstly, the provisions in Article 88 of the Civil Code only apply to contractual relationships, but in the present case, there wasno delivery agreement for delivery whatsoever between the parties, and the delivery was be performed pursuant to the judgment ofthe court, and so the provisions of the contract law are not applicable at all.  Secondly, the provisions of Article 88 only applyto civil legal relationships on the Mainland.  There are provisions in the Civil Code that specifically govern civil legal relationshipsinvolving foreigners.  Hence, Article 88 as referred to by Dong Li Kun is totally irrelevant to the civil legal relationship involvinga foreigner in the present case.  He has mixed up different legal relationships and legal provisions, and his arguments simply lacka legal foundation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  During cross-examination, the Plaintiff put to Professor Zhang that pursuant to the Shanghai Judgment, the Plaintiff and the Defendantbecame a creditor and a debtor, and their relationship was therefore akin to a contractual relationship.  Professor Zhang explainedthat the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant did not arise from any contract, and they could not freely agree onthe terms of the agreement as contractual parties could. Article 88 of the Civil Code therefore does not apply.  I concur with thisview.  Professor Zhang took the view that the place of delivery should be Shanghai and put forward the aforesaid reasons in supportof his view.  I accept his view as it is supported by good reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> As regards whether the Defendant was under the duty and/or obligation to deliver the property to the Plaintiff by taking active stepsand/or to deliver the property to the Plaintiff in Hong Kong, it follows from the aforesaid finding that the Defendant did not haveany duty and/or obligation to deliver the property to the Plaintiff in Hong Kong because the place of delivery should be Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> On the basis of the above findings, the demands made by the Plaintiff for the delivery of his chattels were clearly not good demandsat law.  The Plaintiff asked the Defendant to deliver the chattels to him in Hong Kong, but the relevant PRC law did not requirethe Defendant to do so, nor was she under any contractual obligation to do so.  As the Plaintiffâs demands were not valid demandsat law, the Plaintiffâs claim in detinue must fail.  The cause of action is founded on a valid demand at law made by the Plaintiffand the refusal of the Defendant to comply with that demand.  The above conclusions of mine should be sufficient to dispose of thePlaintiffâs claim, but I shall, for the sake of completeness, proceed to make a finding on the Third Issue as it is clear thatboth parties would like me to do so.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Third Issue</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In considering the Third Issue, a relevant factor is the point of time at which the Plaintiffâs cause of action arose.  This mustbe after the date of the Shanghai Judgment, by which the Shanghai court ordered that the chattels were to be delivered to the Plaintiff,and the legal effect of the Shanghai Judgment was to confer on the Plaintiff the legal title to the  chattels.  On this issue, thetortious act would not arise until after a good and sufficient demand had been made.  Accordingly, in determining whether the Defendantâsacts constituted the tort of detinue, the court only has to consider the Defendantâs acts subsequent to the making by the Plaintiffof a valid demand for the purpose of establishing detinue.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I have already found that, as the Plaintiff has not made such a demand, i.e. a valid demand as required by the common law, the Plaintiffhas failed to establish a case of detinue against the Defendant.  Assuming I am wrong in my finding on the Plaintiffâs demand,and on that basis alone, I shall now consider the Defendantâs acts and determine whether those acts constituted detinue.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The Defendant has not denied the Plaintiffâs right to repossess his chattels.  In the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffrefers to the Defendantâs responses to his demands, which are detailed in paragraph 4 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim (seeabove).  Any act or omission of the Defendant before the date of the demands as pleaded do not serve to support the Plaintiffâspleaded case in his Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  The relevant facts to be considered are the Defendantâs acts subsequent tothe Plaintiffâs demands, and those demands and acts have been pleaded in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  All other facts areirrelevant to this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The Plaintiff pleads that the Defendant refused to accept the Plaintiffâs proposal to use his chattels as security for or chargeagainst his debt in the statutory demand issued against him by the Defendant in the bankruptcy action (see paragraph 4(1) and (2)of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim).  In this connection, the Defendant stated in paragraph 5 of her 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit (see page 251 of the Plaintiffâs Bundle) that, were the Hong Kong Court to decide that it had jurisdiction to administerthe Deceasedâs estate, then the funeral expenses, administrative costs, debts and legal costs which were deductible from the estatewould have exceeded the Plaintiffâs share of the estate and therefore, the Defendant said, there would virtually be nothing leftthat could be used as security.  In my view, the Defendantâs response, and the reasons she gave for refusing to use the Plaintiffâschattels as security for the statutory demand in the bankruptcy proceedings, could not constitute wrongful detention of the chattelsfor the purpose of proving detinue.  And as I have already held, the Plaintiffâs request did not form a good and sufficient demandthat was necessary to found an action in detinue.  Furthermore, the Defendant had good reasons for refusing to accede to the Plaintiffâsrequest to prepare a Security Agreement for him to sign.  For these reasons, the Plaintiff cannot rely on the Defendantâs refusalas the basis for the Plaintiffâs action in detinue.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Then, in paragraph 4(8) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff refers to a letter from the Defendantâs solicitorsMessrs Rita Law &amp; Co., which mentioned the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Regarding Madam Xu Zong Zhenâs Shanghai estate, our client has instructed her Shanghai lawyer to handle the matter.

If we make a reply when in fact the letter does not reflect Mr Chow Shun Yungâs views, it may prejudice the parties concerned.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2.

I will lodge a complaint to the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>If your firm fails to directly account to me in accordance with the advice of the lawyer acting for Stella Pih, I will not hesitateto initiate proceedings against your client Stella Pihin the Hong Kong District Court in May, suing her for <u>wrongful detention of personal property</u>.  She will be asked to describe in the witness box the details of how she conspired with your firm to wrongfully take possessionof my property.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> By a letter dated 26 April 2005, the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer responded to the Plaintiff in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The letter concerning âthe portion of the Shanghai estate belonging to Mr Chow still in the custody of my Shanghai lawyerâ isreceived again.  We reply as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>We reiterate that we are unable to ascertain the authenticity of the signature in your letter and therefore do not know if the lettertruly reflects Mr Chow Shun Yungâs views.

Once we verify Mr Chow Shun Yungâs identity as established by proper means, we will no doubt give relevant answers tothe question raised by Mr Chow Shun Yung in accordance with the relevant legal provisions of the PRC.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Upon receipt of this letter, the Plaintiff formed the view that there was no prospect of his being able to take back the chattels. He filed the present claim accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I therefore have to determine whether the act of the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong in notifying the Plaintiff to approachthe Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer for taking back the Plaintiffâs chattels and the responses of the Shanghai lawyer of the Defendantwere tantamount to detinue or a refusal to deliver up the Plaintiffâs chattels on demand.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> We have already seen that, under the common law, the Defendant was under no duty to deliver the Plaintiffâs chattels to the locationdesignated by the Plaintiff (<i>Capital Finance Co Ltd v.

However, the Plaintiff refused to accept his share, so theDeceasedâs personal property was taken back to Shanghai.  All this is not in dispute.  The Defendant said that she had been advisedby her lawyers in the PRC that it was lawful to have the Deceasedâs personal assets brought to Hong Kong and distributed amongthe beneficiaries in equal shares.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> During cross-examination, the Plaintiff explained that he refused to take possession of the chattels because he was of the view that,as the Hong Kong Probate Registry had not yet issued a Grant of Administration, no one had the legal authority to distribute theestate.  The Plaintiff admitted under cross-examination that he had advised the Defendant to send the Deceasedâs personal propertyback to Shanghai.  He also said under cross-examination that he had told her to take the property back to Shanghai and report tothe police because he suspected that someone was guilty of theft and she should surrender herself to the police.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> It is the Defendantâs case that, for the above reason, the Defendant took those items back to Shanghai and applied to the ShanghaiCourt for an order for the distribution of the Deceasedâs personal estate.  The Shanghai Court delivered the Shanghai Judgmentat the conclusion of the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The middle part of page 3 of the Shanghai Judgment (see page 83 of the Defendantâs Bundle) stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>As the Plaintiff Weh Pih Stella and the Defendant Chow Shun Yung fail to reach any agreement on the distribution of the estate ofXu Zong Zhen, the Plaintiff has commenced proceedings in this Court.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>This Court has commissioned the Lu Wan branch of the Shanghai Valuation Office to assess the value of the estate of Xu Zong Zhen,and the value of the estate (including rings, jade etc) has been assessed at RMB 14,705.62.  The assessment fee of RMB 730 has beendisbursed by the Plaintiff Weh Pih Stella.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The above facts are confirmed by the death certificate of Xu Zong Zhen, the declaration of Xu Yu Rong, the declaration of Zhu Zi Wen,the property checklist in writing, the valuation report of the Lu Wen branch of the Shanghai Valuation Office, and the statementsof the parties.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> For the purpose of the proceedings in Shanghai, the personal assets of the Deceasedâs estate referred to in the Shanghai Judgmentwere brought before the Shanghai Court, which passed them on to the valuation office for assessment.  The Shanghai Court had alsoreferred to the valuation report.  Accordingly, following delivery of the Shanghai Judgment, these items which were part of the Plaintiffâschattels would naturally continue to be kept in Shanghai.  The Defendantâs case is that these items were under custody of her Shanghailawyer.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Under the common law, the Defendant was neither required nor obligated to deliver the Plaintiffâs chattels to the Plaintiff inHong Kong.  Under PRC law, the place of enforcement of the Shanghai Judgment was in Shanghai. In the abovementioned letter of 4 April2005, the Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong requested the Plaintiff to contact the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyers.  This wasa lawful approach.  Furthermore, the tone of the letter indicated that the Defendant had never denied the Plaintiffâs right totake possession of his chattels through the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer.  The Defendantâs solicitors in Hong Kong had also notifiedthe Plaintiff to approach the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer for taking back the chattels.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Both of the abovementioned two letters of the Shanghai branch of Jin Cheng Tong Da Law Office (dated 8 April 2005 and 26 April 2005respectively) mentioned that the Plaintiff had to fulfil similar requirements or take similar steps before the Shanghai lawyer wouldanswer his question as to how he could take possession of his chattels.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The steps required were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The Plaintiff had to âestablish his identity to the law firm by appropriate means such as obtaining a letter from a notarypublicâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer had to verify the Plaintiffâs identification documents.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Upon the consent of Madam Weh Pih Stella, the Plaintiff could raise that question.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     The law firm would then ârespond as appropriateâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> In the present case, the Plaintiff, as the Deceasedâs son, sought to take possession of certain items in the Deceasedâs estatefrom a law firm in a different jurisdiction.  It was legitimate, reasonable and (in the Shanghai lawyerâs opinion) lawful to requirethe Plaintiff to verify his identity in accordance with the PRC law.  It was also legitimate, reasonable and lawful for the Shanghailawyer to verify the documentary proof of identity submitted by the Plaintiff.  There was nothing unusual in this requirement.  Finally,the Shanghai lawyer stated that he had to obtain the Defendantâs consent before responding to the Plaintiffâs question.  I seenothing unusual in the approach taken by the Shanghai lawyer, as an agent and a lawyer, in verifying the Plaintiffâs identity,and then obtaining the Defendantâs consent or taking instructions from her, before explaining to the Plaintiff how the Shanghailawyer would comply with the terms of the Shanghai Judgment on behalf of the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> There is nothing in the above analysis of the responses of the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer to suggest that the Defendant was unwillingto return the Plaintiffâs chattels to him provided that he established his identity etc.  The final paragraph of the letter dated26 April 2005 further stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Once we verify Mr Chow Shun Yungâs identity as established by proper means, we will no doubt give relevant answers to the questionraised by Mr Chow Shun Yung in accordance with the relevant legal provisions of the PRC.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> This sentence clearly expressed the Shanghai lawyerâs intention of responding to the Plaintiffâs question in accordance withPRC law upon verification of the Plaintiffâs identity.  There was no indication of unwillingness on the Defendantâs part to deliverthe Plaintiffâs chattels to him.  The Plaintiff too hastily formed the view that the Defendant was unwilling to deliver the Plaintiffâschattels to him when he had not even established his identity to the Defendantâs Shanghai lawyer.  As stated above, as a prudentlawyer, it was reasonable for the Shanghai lawyer, who was acting for a client in another jurisdiction on the distribution of anestate, to require the Plaintiff to establish his identity.  In my judgment, the Plaintiff has failed to establish that the Defendantâsacts and correspondence as pleaded in paragraph 4 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim constituted a refusal to allow the Plaintiffto collect his chattels from the Shanghai assets.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Fourth Issue</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> This issue is irrelevant to the cause of action in detinue.  The Plaintiff only raised this issue in the hope that he could use itas the basis of claiming indemnity costs against the Defendant if judgment was given in his favour.  In light of my judgment thatthe Plaintiff has plainly failed to establish a case against the Defendant, this issue is simply irrelevant and need not be considered.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> On the basis of the above findings, the Plaintiffâs claim must fail.  I give judgment for the Defendant and make the followingorders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The Plaintiffâs claim is dismissed.  I make an order nisi for costs of the action to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant tobe taxed if not agreed.  I also grant Certificate for Counsel.</p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>    </blockquote>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">  (C.B.
