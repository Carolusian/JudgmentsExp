The red amendments were made in November2002 and, amongst other things, added the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants as parties to the action originally brought against just the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  The green re-amendments were made in September 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff was a manufacturer and seller of die cast scale models of cars and motorbikes.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was a manufacturer of moulds for the production of models and a manufacturer of those models.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were the majority and minority owners respectively and the directors of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Agreement was for a duration of 10 years, to 2006, and under it the parties agreed not to produce products in competition witheach other, and to avoid selling any of the products produced by the plaintiff or 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to a purchaser whom they knew or ought to have known might re-sell them outside the countries specified by the Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff was appointed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the sole and exclusive distributor of specific products of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in Germany and Belgium, and the sole and exclusive selling agent for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs products in some specific countries (âthe agency territoriesâ).  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff 5% commission on the sales of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs products sold to purchasers in the agency territories.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also agreed that it would avoid selling any of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs products to any person whom it reasonably believed might resell them in Germany, Belgium and other countries wherethe plaintiff was the agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for its products.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants agreed that they would cause and procure the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to comply with these various terms of the Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The thrust of the claim is that the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants had been in breach of the Agreement by causing and procuring the incorporation of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and its subsidiaries (including the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant) and thereafter by embarking on a course of conduct to circumvent the contractual obligations owed to the plaintiff underthe Agreement, in particular the plaintiffâs sole and exclusive distributorship and selling agent rights.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The red amendments to the claim formulated the claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants based on the tort of unlawful interference with contract.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  I think a fair summary of the claim was provided by Mr Nick Pirie (appearing with Miss Annie Lai on behalf of the plaintiff) asbeing a claim arising from a scheme to establish, construct and operate a new corporate and distribution structure to manufacture,market and distribute models in breach of the Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Pirie criticized the defendants for being at least less than forthcoming in their approach to the provision of material informationand documents over the years, exemplified (he said) by the only recent provision of facts and documents in broad terms giving riseto the applications now before the Court.  As to the criticized defendantsâ discovery so far in the action, I was provided witha decision of the Court of Appeal arising from an application for specific discovery against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (see further below).</p>    <p class="heading">The summonses</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  There were three summonses before the Court, all brought by the plaintiff.  In chronological order, they were:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   a summons dated 3 June 2010, pursuing against all defendants further and better lists of documents, alternatively specific discoveryof the documents or classes of documents set out in the Schedule to the summons (âthe discovery applicationâ);</p>        <p>(2)   a summons dated 2 July 2010, seeking leave to file and serve a Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim so as to add the proposed purpleamendments, and consequential directions (âthe amendment applicationâ); and</p>        <p>(3)   a summons dated 11 November 2010, seeking leave to amend the Schedule to the 3 June discovery summons, and seeking an orderthat the further and better lists or specific discovery sought should be deposed to by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and the directors of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants in person, in default of which the Defence(s) should be struck out.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Order of play</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The proposed amendment to the Schedule of classes of documents was not controversial and I allowed that amendment to be made atbeginning of the hearing.  The argument on disclosure, therefore, proceeded on the basis of the Amended Schedule.  (For the avoidanceof confusion later, it may be helpful to point out here that the amendments to the schedule included adding two new categories ofdocuments sought and deleted one, so that the categories pursued are lettered A, B, C, D, E, G and Hâno F.)</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  But it was therefore necessary to decide in which order to deal with the issues of (a) proposed amendments to the claim by the amendmentapplication and (b) the pursued discovery under the discovery application.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  At the commencement of the hearing, I indicated to the parties my provisional view that the amendment application should be dealtwith first.  (Indeed, I understood that at the most recent CMC or call-over hearing Mr Justice Au may also have independently indicatedhis view that that would be the appropriate order for dealing with matters.)</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Edward Shum (appearing for the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants) sought to persuade me otherwise.  Referring to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Iu Po Cheung v. The Commissioner for Census and Statistics</i> (unreported, CACV240/2008, 13 May 2009), Mr Shum suggested that by its discovery application the plaintiff was trying to make a collateralattack on an order already made by the Court of Appeal in the course of these proceedingsâsee CACV139/2005, 14 December 2005, reportedat  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKC%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKC 238âwhich</a> order was binding on the plaintiff and the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants.  As a result, he said, the amendment application was made after the discovery application with the ulterior purpose ofjustifying another round of discovery.  I should, therefore, deal with the applications in the order in which they were issued.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  At the hearing, I ruled that I would hear the amendment application first.  As I briefly reasoned, I decided to do so because itseemed to me that, though there was some force in the suggestion that the amendment application was in part a reaction to the responseby then received to the discovery application, it would be pointless to hear the discovery application on the basis of the then stateof the pleadings, at a time when the amendment application had already been issued and would fall to be determined. If any amendmentmight be allowed, it would alter the context against which any discovery should be considered.  It seemed to me that at best thepoints taken by Mr Shum in this regard were technical and as to form, and might well lead to a waste of time and costs if discoverywere to have to be potentially sought and argued again in the light of any amendments as might by then have been allowed.</p>    <p class="heading">The amendment application</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The precise amendments sought at the hearing were slightly different from the version appended to the 3 June summons, and the hearingproceeded upon the âfinalâ version draft Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim as was placed in the hearing bundle.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Those proposed purple amendments to the claim were not opposed by Miss Queenie Lau (appearing for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants), but were opposed by Mr Shum (for the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The principles applicable to applications to amend pleadings are well-settled and were not the subject of dispute between the parties. They can be set out very shortly. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In essence, the general position is that amendments will be allowed at any stage of the proceedings if they are for the purposeof identifying for determination the real question(s) in controversy between the parties; necessary for disposing fairly of the causeor matter, or saving costs; and would not result in prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated for by costs.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Of course, any amendment proposed should be properly formulated and particularized, and proposed amendments which are immaterialor useless will not be permitted.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Court has power to grant or allow an amendment after the expiry of any relevant period of limitation notwithstanding that theeffect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new cause of action, provided that the new cause of action arises out of thesame facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the actionby the party applying for leave to make the amendment. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In such a case, the Court has to decide (a) whether any amendment introduces a new cause of action, (b) if so, whether any applicablelimitation period has expired by the date of the hearing, and (c) if so, whether the new cause of action arises out of the same orsubstantially the same facts as the cause of action already pleaded: see <i>RHC O. 20 r. </i>5(2) and (5); and <i>Paragon Finance plc v. DB Thakerer &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20All%20ER%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 All ER 400</a>, at 404h.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr Shum made it clear that there were a number of proposed amendments which he did not oppose.  This was either because they wereminor corrections to the existing pleading or because they were parts of the pleading apparently directed at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3rd defendants.  Those parts of the proposed amendments which were controversial were essentially to be found in the new paragraphs17A and 17B.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  After hearing argument in this case, I allowed the amendments, for reasons which I now give.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  First, as a result of the non-opposition from three of the five defendants, I was left in the slightly odd position of perhaps allowingamendments to one claim document, but only insofar as the amendments were to be taken as being against one group of defendants, butnot the other.  Hence, it seemed to me that, notwithstanding the position taken by Miss Lau, I should be satisfied that the amendmentswere appropriate for leave to be granted as against any defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Secondly, I do not accept Mr Shumâs first submissionâ attractive though it is at first blushâthat the amendments should bedisallowed because of inconsistent claims.  Mr Shum points to various parts of the existing pleading (in particular in paragraph16A) which highlight the role of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the âpuppet-masterâ.  He then suggests that it would be contrary to common sense to argue in the same pleading thatthe 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants have induced the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3rd defendants to breach the Agreement.  He also points to an inducement occurring if the breach of contract is fairly attributableto âany pressure, persuasion or procuration on the part of the defendantâ: see <i>Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong,</i> Vol. 25(1) (2007 Reissue) [380.504] fn 3.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  But I think this submission forgets the corporate personality, nature and identity of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, and the allegation that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was in control of both the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants (Mr Pirie describing them loosely as being in one âgroupâ).  It also overlooks the way in which the liability of thosedefendants is said to arise, namely as accessories to the liability of the other defendants who are the contracting parties: see,for example, <i>OBG Limited v. Allan; Douglas v. Hello</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 AC 1</a>, at [5].</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Shumâs other main submission was as regards the limitation point.  It proceeded from the starting point that whatever the causeof action, the limitation period had long ago expired. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Then he pointed out that the claim as previously formulated against his clients was (as the Court of Appeal pointed out in late2005) on the tort of unlawful interference with contract, whereas the proposed new plea seemed expressly to delete that plea, andto replace it with a claim based on the tort of procuring or inducing breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  He referred to the <i>OBG</i> case, in whichâfollowing a review of the relevant authorities of the two areasâthe distinct identities of these two torts wasset out.  Earlier characterizations of the unlawful interference tort as being a âgenusâ of which the procuring breach tort wasa âspeciesâ were there rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Hence, Mr Shum submitted that the proposed amendments clearly introduced a new cause of action, so that if any amendment were tobe permitted it must be under an exception to the rule that amendment will not be permitted if it seeks to introduce a new causeof action after limitation has expired.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Whilst it is undoubtedly correct that the <i>OBG</i> case highlighted the distinct identities of the two torts, the historical review of the relevant authorities also clearly identifiedthat the separate torts were for a considerable period of time considered part of a âunified theoryâ.  It seems to me that itis part of the ratio of the <i>OBG</i> case that the unified theory is taken to be discredited, for the reasons explained in the speeches, in particular in that of LordHoffmann.  As that case was not decided until 2007, it would seem a little unfair if the pleading against the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants is criticized for proceeding on a theory of the law as was prevalent at the time of the pleading in 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  But, in any event, liability for inducing breach of contract was first established by the famous case of <i>Lumley v. Gye</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281853%29%202%20E%20%26%20B%20216" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1853) 2 E&amp;B 216</a>, where the court based its decision on the general principle that a person who procures another to commit a wrong incurs liabilityas an accessory. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  This is to be contrasted with the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, where a defendantâs liability is primary, for intentionallycausing the plaintiff loss by unlawfully interfering with the liberty of others.  While such âinterference with businessâ doesnot require that existing contracts have been broken, the cause of action only exists where the claimant has suffered damage whichthe defendant has intentionally brought about by the use of unlawful means.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Pirie submitted that the plaintiffâs claim has always been one of the <i>Lumley v. Gye</i> sort.  I tend to agree that the factual circumstances delineated in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim would seem more akin to thatsort of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  I am not, therefore, satisfied that it is either correctâor would be fairâto consider the proposed amendments to paragraphs17A and 17B as the setting up of a new cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  But that may not matter as I am also perfectly satisfied that, even if it is a new cause of action, it arises out of the same orsubstantially the same facts as the cause of action already pleaded.  The thrust of the claim brought by the plaintiff against alldefendants was, and under the amendments it would remain, one arising from an alleged scheme to establish, construct and operatea new corporate and distribution structure to manufacture, market and distribute models in breach of the Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The way in which that claim is now to be particularized is within the principles set out in the case of <i>Nagata v. New Japan Securities International (HK) Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20HKC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 HKC 134</a>, another case in which criticism was made as to the way in which discovery had been given by the party resisting the amendment.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As to the submission of Mr Shum that the proposed amendments also introduce new allegations of fact of a different character fromthose pleaded, by reference to new definitions of products, I accept Mr Pirieâs submission that the definitions now used are intendedto be closer to those terms used in the Agreement.  Of course, it will be a major battleground at trial as to what those terms meanin that context, but that is not, in my view, a basis for refusing in the exercise of my discretion to allow the amendments.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I note that there was no suggestion of any prejudice which might be suffered by the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> defendants not remediable by the appropriate costs order.  Whilst I agree that there may not be, to use Mr Shumâs words, âanymagicâ in an affirmation, the absence of any evidence filed by those defendants asserting prejudice is something for me to bearin mind, as I consider the application against the other circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I have taken account of the timing of the amendment application against the progress, or lack of it, of this action generally, butI do not think the timing is determinative of the application to amend.  Indeed, there is at least some force in the point made forthe plaintiff that the amendment comes in part from the ability to make express factual matters which were long suspected to be thecase (such as the ownership of the Davidson factory), but confirmation of which came from the defendants only in documents and supplementalwitness statements filed earlier this calendar year.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  For the avoidance of doubt, I express that I consider it just in the circumstances I have outlined above to grant leave to amend:see <i>RHC O. 20 r. 5(2) and (5)</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In the exercise of my discretion, therefore, I allowed the purple amendments.  The consequential directions for leave to the defendantsto make responsive amended pleadings are not controversial, and I grant then 28 days each within which to file those pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  As to costs, I make an order nisi that the costs of and occasioned by the amendments shall be payable by the plaintiff to the defendantsin any event, to be taxed if not agreed.  The costs of the application will fall into those costs, save for the costs of the argumentitself, which I order to be paid by the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants to the plaintiff in any event, to be taxed if not agreed.  The argument in question lasted 2Â½ hours.</p>    <p class="heading">The discovery application</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Again, the principles applicable on the discovery application are well settled and need not be set out at any length.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Mr Pirie told me his main application was for a further and better list of documents under <i>RHC O. 24 r. 3</i>.  The effect of that rule includes enabling a party to apply for discovery by list, or for an affidavit verifying a list, againsta party who has not fulfilled his obligations under <i>O. 24 r. 2</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Ordinarily, a list of documents verified by affidavit is conclusive, subject to two qualifications. One is that an application maybe made for a further and better list of documents where it appears (a) from the list itself, or (b) from the documents referredto in it, or (c) from admissions made either in the pleadings of the party making discovery or otherwise, that the party making discoveryhas or has had other relevant documents in its possession, custody or power.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The other qualification is that an application may be made under <i>O. 24 r. 7</i> for an affidavit in regard to specific documents or classes of documents, where the facts fall within that rule.  An applicationunder that rule must be supported by an affidavit stating that in the belief of the deponent the other party has or has had certainspecific documents which relate to the matter in question.  If a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out for (a) possession, custody or power, and (b) relevance of the specified documents, an order may be made.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  There is no jurisdiction to make an order unless (a) there is sufficient evidence that the documents exist which the other partyhas not disclosed; (b) the document or documents relate to matters in issue in the action; and (c) there is sufficient evidence thatthe document is or was in the possession, custody or power of the other party.  If those matters are established, the court has adiscretion whether or not to order disclosure.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  One area of dispute at the hearing was whether or not the test of relevance in Hong Kong is still that in the <i>Peruvian Guano</i> case, Mr Shum suggesting that the excesses of that type of discovery are to be deplored.  But, whatever one might personally thinkof the application of that test to many cases, I accept Mr Pirieâs submission that the <i>Peruvian Guano</i> test is still the applicable test even after the Civil Justice Reforms of 2009 (when the possibility of removing that test was rejected).</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  At the hearing, Mr Pirie told me that his main application was under <i>r. 3</i>, but it seems to me that where the application has largely proceeded by reference to the Amended Schedule of documents or classesof documents sought, the application is more likely to be treated as one primarily under <i>r. 7</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  As a successful application under that rule would lead to an order for provision of an affidavit of disclosure, it is of coursepossible to meet such an application by filing an affidavit.  The assertions made in that affidavit are able to be tested, albeitby reference to the fact that an affirmation as to disclosure is usually conclusive at the interlocutory stage of an action.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Anyway, as the argument (in skeletons and orally) focused on the categories in the Amended Schedule, I shall approach the issuesby reference to that schedule.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I should first, however, deal with Mr Pirieâs submission (presaged in the affidavit of his instructing solicitor, Mr Fyfe, thatled the application) that the discovery from the defendants so far is plainly defective.  I can do so shortly, as I think there isreal force in the suggestion that the defendants have been less than forthcoming in their disclosure, and I note that Mr JusticeAu has already expressed concern as to the approach to disclosure taken at least by the solicitor for the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  With the benefit of the further information (the plaintiff would say âadmissionsâ) provided this year in disclosure and supplementalwitness statements, the plaintiff has now pleaded a case of the alleged arrangements by which it says the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and companies it alleges are under his control schemed to avoid the Agreement.  I was provided with a flow chart of theway in which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant manufactured models to order, and how the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant did so too, the latter in part from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and in part from Davidson, and how the orders from otherwise different defendants and sources appear to have been consolidatedfor shipment to the same customers at the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I was shown a schedule produced in a Bundle F for an earlier CMC hearing on 12 April 2010, from which it can fairly be assertedby the plaintiff that a number of documents as might well have been expected to be disclosed have not been disclosed.  These aredocuments of a standard type usually generated on the manufacture and shipment of products.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I accept, on the other hand, that the case now put in the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim (leave for which amendments I grantedâseeabove) is put rather more clearly as to the alleged connection between the various individual and corporate entities said to havebeen part of the scheme to avoid compliance with the Agreement, and to conceal the alleged non-compliance.  This is following theconfirmation by the 1st, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants of those matters of fact previously suspected by the plaintiff, and from which it will seek to invite certain inferencesat trial.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  So it may not be productive to spend too much time analyzing precisely what certainly should or should not have been disclosed previously. As I have said, it will be more productive to look at the categories of documents sought in the Amended Schedule.  If it seems thatsuch documents should now be disclosed, that can be ordered without deciding whether or not they might or should earlier have beendisclosed. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  That there are apparently fair criticisms of disclosure so far is perhaps more use in deciding whether any further disclosure shouldbe verified by affidavit/affirmation personally from the defendants or their officers.</p>    <p>Category AâInvoices issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to customers in Europe in respect of the sale and supply of 1/18 scale die cast model cars together with purchase orders,shipping documents and accounting records relating to these invoices for the period between 28 December 1996 and 27 December 2006</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  This category of documents is sought against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants only.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  As a result of points taken by Miss Lau, it was accepted by Mr Pirie that any such documents ordered should be for the period onlyfrom 1 October 2001 (as earlier matters were dealt with in another action between the parties relating to commission for goods upto September 2001).</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Miss Lau also submitted that though the discovery sought now expanded the documents beyond the two brands previously relevant (andalready disclosed), the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were prepared to make discovery in respect of the models of the âUT brandâ.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The only point of contention remaining, therefore, on this category was whether the class of documents to be disclosed should belimited to the <i>âinvoicesâ</i> or whether it should also include the <i>âpurchase orders, shipping documents and accounting records relating to these invoicesâ</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  As this point of contention arises also for categories B, C, D, E, G and H (that is, all other categories sought), I shall decidethe point in this context, but it will have application across all categories.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The submission of Miss Lauâand Mr Shum in relation to the other categoriesâis that in light of the fact that the connectionbetween the various entities is not denied, then should there be any finding of wrongdoing by the defendants the documents now soughtare really relevant only to quantum, in showing the value of the goods that will be said to have been traded in breach of the obligationsowed under the Agreement.  For that purpose, the invoices showing the number of items and their value is all that is reasonably necessary,and all the other documents sought are simply not necessary, and to order disclosure of them would be oppressive.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  For his part, Mr Pirie says that the invoices may not tell the whole story, as some of the goods shipped may have been returned(for example, as defective) and so the proper quantum amount might not be revealed by invoices alone.  But this is a risk borne bythe defendants, as any returned goods would only go to reduce damages, and the defendants cannot suggest any lower figure than theinvoices show.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Similarly, although I understood Mr Pirie to be suggesting also that the other documents might reveal matters which are not otherwiseapparent from the invoices, such as which invoiced goods might have been consolidated and shipped with which other invoiced goods,I do not think that identifies any need for any wider discovery than the invoices themselves.  If the plaintiff is correct in itsallegations, all the goods sold in circumvention of the Agreement will give rise to a good claim and it does not matter in what wayor with what other goods they were shipped.  Also, the other documents sought are only those relating to the invoices, so they willnot identify any other invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The wide request by reference to âaccounting recordsââ which Mr Fyfe expanded in the headings in his affidavit as <i>âincluding sales and accounting ledgersâ</i> (note, including but apparently not limited to those ledgers)âto me rather smacks of âfishingâ, and an order for discoveryof such material is almost bound to cover material which is plainly irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  I will therefore only make an order in relation to the invoices themselves.</p>    <p>Category BâInvoices issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in respect of the sale and supply of 1/18 scale die cast model cars and for delivery to destinations in Europe, togetherwith the purchase orders, shipping documents and accounting records relating to these invoices for the period 27 March 1998 to 27December 2006</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  This category of documents is sought against all five defendants.  It relates primarily to indirect sale of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs products to customers in Europe via the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (or its subsidiaries).</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I shall read down the category to include only the invoices and not the other documents relatingto these invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  For this category, Miss Lau submitted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had already deposed to the fact that he has disclosed all invoices in respect of sales by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant regarding 1/18 scale models.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  If it were necessary to say so, this fact identifies a recognition that such invoices are relevant and discloseable, but I notethat the relevant 6th Affirmation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant deals only with documents the 1<sup>st</sup>to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants âhaveâ.  By use of this word âhaveâ, it is at least not clear if this is actually deposing to documents presentlyin their possession custody or power, and it certainly does not deal with documents which may formerly have been in their possessioncustody or power.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In my view, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants should file a further affirmation or affidavit dealing properly with the category in accordance with the full and correctterminology of discovery (not simply as a matter of form, of course, but to ensure dealing with the substance).</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  One real area of dispute on this category relates to the period of the invoices to be disclosed.  The plaintiff points to the factthat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has disclosed invoices issued by it to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant for 1999â2000, whereas the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant has disclosed invoices issued by it to the European customers for the period from 1998 to 2006.  From this, it is suggestedthat the sale of 1/18 models by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant must have started before 1999 and continued after 2000 to 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The discrepancy in dates arises because the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants assert, at paragraph 25(d) of their Re-Amended Defence and at paragraph 33 of the Supplemental Witness Statement of the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant sold its factory Dongguan UT to an unrelated third party, Kolara Limited (âKolaraâ), with completion of the sale inlate November 2000.  Therefore, it is those defendantsâ case that after that date they had nothing to do with any sales or shipmentsby Dongguan UT into Europe via the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Kolara is a company incorporated in Mauritius on 30 March 2000, and the plaintiff points to certain materials as giving it goodreason to doubt that Kolara was really an independent third party.  For example, there is an invoice in relation to professionalservices rendered in regards registration and licence fees, issued by Dynamic Consultants Limited to Kolara at a GPO Box addressin Mauritius marked specifically for the attention of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The plaintiff says this shows he is behind and financing Kolara, and the real owner.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  It is also pointed out that Dynamic Consultants is the same company registered as the Company Secretary for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant companies.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Kolara has apparently been struck off from the Mauritius register, albeit that steps are being taken (by persons and for reasonsunknown) for its registration to be re-activated.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  I accept that this material does give rise to at least some suggestion that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is involved with and may even be the owner and controller of Kolara, but this issue is not something I am able to decidenow on the materials I have, and without cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  But, in any event, the category of documents sought is as regards invoices issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, so even were I to proceed on an assumption that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant somehow has power over the documents of Kolara (a non-party to this action), invoices which might have been issued by Kolarato the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant do not fall within the category sought.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  For the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, Mr Shum says that they have already given âvoluntaryâ disclosure of the relevant invoices from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  (I do not, for the moment, need to worry about the idea of âvoluntaryâ disclosure, though I see some force in MrPirieâs submission that this may identify an error in approach to the obligations of disclosure.)</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Mr Shum can also point to the 5<sup>th</sup> Affirmation of Jimmy Arafino Ibrahim, aka Jimmy Yee, a director of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, where he states in paragraph 7 that after the sale by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant of the production facilities in late 2000, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant ceased placing orders with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Again, it seems obvious that whoever owns Kolara, the practical likelihood is that any invoices from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would have ceased after November 2000.  To put it another way, I would not be prima facie satisfied that there are anyother documents in existence as fall within this category beyond those already disclosed (subject to a properly worded affirmationor affidavit confirming the position as regards documents previously in possession custody or power, but since given up).</p>    <p>Category CâInvoices issued by Davidson to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in respect of the sale and supply of 1/12 and 1/43 scale die cast model cars and for delivery to destinations in Europe,together with the purchase orders, shipping documents and accounting records relating to these invoices for the period 18 December1998 to 24 April 2003</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  This category of documents is sought against all five defendants.  It relates primarily to indirect sale of the plaintiffâs productsby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to customers in Europe via Davidson and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (or its subsidiaries).</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I shall again read down the category to include only the invoices and not the other documents relatingto these invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants say the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has affirmed at paragraphs 28â31 of his 6th Affirmation that they do not have any documents beyond those already disclosedin their 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental List. Again, I think the affirmation is not full in that it refers only to documents those defendants âhaveâ andI would require a proper affirmation as set out above.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, through the 5<sup>th</sup> Affirmation of Mr Ibrahim, say that all model cars ordered from Davidson were covered in the relevant 1,073 invoices disclosed inthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental List.  I do not think there is any basis for me to assume any prima facie case otherwise.</p>    <p>Category DâInvoices issued by Davidson to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in respect of the sale and supply of 1/12 and 1/43 scale die cast model cars and for delivery to destinations in Japan,Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America, together with the purchase orders, shipping documents and accounting records relatingto these invoices for the period 18 December 1998 to 24 April 2003</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  This category of documents is sought against all five defendants.  It relates primarily to indirect sale of the plaintiffâs productsby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to customers in Japan and the other listed countries via Davidson and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (or its subsidiaries).</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I shall again read down the category to include only the invoices and not the other documents relatingto these invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Now that the purple amendments have been allowed, the defendantsâ objection to this category on the basis that it was not relevantto the case previously pleaded must fall away.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It seems to me that this category should be disclosed.  Insofar as the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants have said that they have in any event already disclosed all items falling within the category, that was in correspondenceand a proper affirmation of discovery in this regard should be made.</p>    <p>Category EâInvoices issued by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to customers in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America in respect of the sale and supply of 1/12 and 1/43scale die cast model cars, together with the purchase orders, shipping documents and accounting records relating to these invoicesfor the period 27 March 1998 to 27 December 2006</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  This category of documents is sought against all five defendants.  It is said to relate primarily to indirect sale of the plaintiffâsproducts by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to customers in Japan and the other listed countries via Davidson and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (or its subsidiaries).</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I shall again read down the category to include only the invoices and not the other documents relatingto these invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  First, I would point out that as the documents sought are those issued by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, there is no basis for suggesting that the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants would have possession or custody of them.  It also seems to me that there is also no real basis for suggesting that the1<sup>st</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants might have power over the documents.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  The only suggestion properly made is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has power over the documents.  This is suggested by the plaintiff on the basis that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is the owner and controller of at least a majority shareholding in the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Of course, this may be a major issue at trial, but in any event I do not accept that is shown to be the case on the evidence I have. The evidence shows that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is the minority 40% shareholder of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, the remainder being held by two other minority shareholders, namely Mr Ibrahim as to 40% and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs wife as to 20%.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  I do not think I can assume even for the purpose of this application that the other shares are in reality owned or controlled bythe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  He is also not a director of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant or 5<sup>th</sup> defendant.  So, in sum, I do not accept that the documents in this category are in his power.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In any event, where the same discovery is also sought directly from the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, there is no real need to order disclosure against the other defendants.  The situation is quite different from one wherediscovery is sought of documents from a non-party over which documents it is said a party has power.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  But, I also do not think that discovery is to be ordered against the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants.  Insofar as there is any claim by the plaintiff arising from goods which were manufactured by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or Davidson and sold on by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, the relevant documents are already covered by other categories of documents sought.  Insofar as there may have been theonsale of goods manufactured by other manufacturers, those matters are not relevant on the pleadings.</p>    <p>Category GâPurchase orders, shipping documents, sales ledgers and the accounting records relating to: (i) all sales to the Europeancustomers named in the 1,073 invoices issued by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant disclosed in the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendantsâ 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental List of Documents; and (ii) sales of 1/12, 1/18 and 1/43 scale die cast model cars to other European customers of the4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p>Category HâInvoices issued to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant by suppliers of the products, whose onward sales by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant are represented in the sales invoices and other documents in Categories E and G, together with purchase orders, shippingdocuments, purchase ledgers and other account in records relating to these invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Both these categories of documents are sought against all five defendants, and for the period from 27 March 1998 to 27 December2006.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Again, the reasons I have outlined above, I would read down this Category H so that it is limited to invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Again, for the reasons I have also given above, I see no basis on which to order disclosure of these two categories against the1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In any event, by virtue of the disclosure already provided by the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, and by reference to the other points which I have made above, I am not persuaded that either category of documents isnecessary to be disclosed.  In other words, even assuming that there is a proper foundation for jurisdiction for me to exercise thediscretion in favour of an order for disclosure of these categories of documents (of which I am not convinced), in the exercise ofthat discretion I would refuse to make such order.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The categories are also far too widely drawn, and it is plain that the documents within them cannot all be considered relevant tothe issues in this action.  Some of the documents must or prima facie would relate to sales of models to customers, which sales havenothing to do with the issues framed by the pleadings.</p>    <p class="heading">Confirmation of disclosure on affirmation/affidavit</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In light of the way discovery has so far come about, and because of the importance of the discovery matters, in the exercise ofmy discretion I consider that it is appropriate for the defendantsâ discovery to be confirmed on oath or affirmation, such deponentsto be the individual defendants personally and an officer of each of the corporate defendants in person.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  As to the form of further disclosure, I consider that a further and better list should be provided, namely by further supplementallists of documents, of any further documents which are to be disclosed under the categories of documents I have ordered as will beaffirmed to in the affidavits of specific discovery.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I shall not at this juncture accede to the plaintiffâs application that the Defences be struck out in default of the confirmationof discovery on oath or affirmation.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  I am conscious that not all the documents sought by the plaintiff have been ordered, and it seems to me that the defendants havehad some success in defeating parts of the application as framed.  Not only have I refused entire categories sought, I have readdown others, and ordered some against one âcampâ of defendants only.  On the other hand, I have accepted that there was somevalid criticism of the approach to disclosure so far taken by the defendants.  In the circumstances, I would be inclined to exercisemy discretion as to the costs of the discovery application by allowing the plaintiff half its costs of the application in any event.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  In conclusion, and by reference to the amendment application and the discovery application (as amended), having
