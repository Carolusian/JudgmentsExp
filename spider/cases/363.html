In the telephone conversation he informed Mr. Leung that he was diagnosed to suffer from rectumcancer.   He also requested him to make arrangements because the month of August was the period of enrolment of students from midAugust to near the end of August.   He has been assigned duties concerning enrolment for two or three days.   He informed Mr. Leungthat the doctor had arranged for him to undergo an operation to cut away the cancerous rectum.  He did not telephone the Principalto inform her of this because the normal practice in applying for leave is to inform the administrative officer.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  After the operation whilst he was in hospital, Mr. Leung and a teacher Mr. Tung came to visit him in hospital.

He sent all his medical certificates to the Defendant by registeredmail to the Principal at the Kowloon City branch of the Defendant.   Subsequently, he asked his younger brother to deliver a sickleave application to the Principal.    He sent all his medical sick leave certificates to the school Principal by registered post. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On or about 18October 2002 he received a document from his doctor dated 18 October 2002 at page 73 Tab 21 enclosing a Certificateat page 72 which state that the Plaintiff is currently under convalescence recovering from surgical illness.  It stated that he mayreturn to his original post after full recovery.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Plaintiff called a witness, Mr. Fu Siu Kit who stated that he was present when Mr. Leung telephoned the Principal to tell herthat the Plaintiff was suffering from cancer.   It was on a Monday after Mr. Leung visited the Plaintiff in hospital.   He knew itwas the Principal on the other side because Mr. Leung informed him.   It was his practice to report everything to the Principal. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On the Defendantâs part, the Principal Ms. Li Fung King gave evidence.   She denied that she had knowledge that the Plaintiffhad cancer.   She only knew he was sick.   She stated that in August, Mr. Leung, the administrative officer of the North Point branchtold her that he had received a telephone call from the family of the Plaintiff.  He told her that the Plaintiff was in hospitalundergoing surgery.  She had planned for the Plaintiff to come back for work in August but the Plaintiff was unable to do so.   Mr. Leung did not mention the nature of the Plaintiffâs illness.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Towards the end of August, Mr. Leung informed her that the Plaintiff needed to take leave for a longer period of time.  The Plaintiffallegedly did not state that nature of his illness.   He did not state when he could return to work.   Because the 1<sup>st</sup> September is the start of the new school year and the Plaintiff did not say when he could return to the school, she told the SchoolSupervisor that the Plaintiff needed to take longer leave.   Because of the fact that they must have a teacher by the 1<sup>st</sup> September, they employed Mr. Leung Man To to replace the Plaintiff.   Mr. Leung Man Toâs contract was for one academic year. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On about 1<sup>st</sup> October, the School Supervisor informed her to find out when the Plaintiff could return to work.   After a few days, Mr. Leung repliedthat the Plaintiff could not give an exact date when he could return to work in the School.   She stated that in all the sick leavecertificates and medical report given to the school there was no mention of the nature of the illness of the Plaintiff.   She statedthat she knew the Plaintiff had surgery and that he was sick and had an illness.   When she was asked whether she was eager to knowwhat was the nature of the Plaintiffâs illness, she did not reply directly but said that she did not ask.   She stated that noother staff had taken as long a period of leave as the Plaintiff.   She said that it did not occur to her to ask what illness thePlaintiff was suffering from.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In my view it is unbelievable that Ms. Li as the school Principal did not ask the nature of the Plaintiffâs illness when the Plaintiffhad taken leave of absence and she had to plan ahead for the school and its needs.    Knowledge of the diagnosis of the Plaintiffâsillness and the purpose of the surgery and its prognosis would have helped her to assess whether the leave of the Plaintiff is likelyto be long or short.     In my view, it is highly unlikely that she as a responsible Principal is totally unconcerned about the natureof the Plaintiffâs illness as he has been working for the Defendant since 1988 and was a good teacher.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I therefore do not believe in her evidence in relation to his issue.

Clearly a person who wasabsent for a similar period but did not have a disability would also have his or her contract terminated.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  It is for this reason that the Defendantâs Counsel submits that there is no direct discrimination of the Plaintiff for his disability.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The reasoning of the Plaintiffâs Legal Representative is that from the facts, an irresistible inference could be drawn that thePlaintiff was dismissed as soon as the Defendant discovered that he had cancer.   This is because the Defendant employed Mr. LeungMan To for the whole academic year.   This shows that the Defendant had the intention at that point to dismiss the Plaintiff.   ThePlaintiffâs Legal Representative submitted that the Defendant did not dismiss the Plaintiff at the time because it was uncertainwhether to do so would contravene the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.   Once the Defendant came to the conclusion that the Plaintiffâs contract of employment was not a continuous contract of employmentin October, the Defendant dismissed the Plaintiff.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Legal Representative submitted that if the Court is satisfied that the Defendant decided to dismiss the Plaintiffas soon as it was aware that he had cancer, and that a teacher without the Plaintiffâs disability would not have been so dismissed,direct discrimination is established, on the basis that he was being treated less favourably on the ground of his disability.  Thecorrect comparator is simply a teacher who did not have the Plaintiffâs disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Even if the Court accepts the Defendantâs argument that the Plaintiff was dismissed because of his inability to return to worknot because of his disability, the Plaintiff submits that the comparison should be made between the Plaintiff and another teacherwho is not able to return to work but who does not have the Plaintiffâs disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Legal Representative presented a second limb of her argument and submitted that Ms. Li said that no other teacherhas taken leave for a period as long as the Plaintiff has taken, in such circumstances, she argues that the court may choose a hypotheticalcomparator.  The evidence from Ms. Li confirmed that the school would not have dismissed a teacher who is on maternity leave, oris required to take leave to give evidence in court or to perform jury duty.  In such circumstances, if the Court accepts that thePlaintiff was dismissed because he was unable to attend to work, the dismissal received by the Plaintiff was less favourable whencompared with another teacher who did not have a disability and was required to take leave for maternity or to give evidence.  Thisis because they would be allowed to take leave and would not be dismissed.  The Plaintiffâs Legal Representative contends thaton that basis, the Court should have no difficulty finding that the Plaintiff would not have been dismissed but for his disabilityand that he was subjected to a less favourable treatment on the ground of his disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Having heard argument of the Plaintiffâs Legal Representative, I find the 2<sup>nd</sup> limb of her argument in support of direct discrimination more convincing and I am not able to accept the first limb of her argumentfor direct discrimination.   The reason is, I am of the view that it is not easy to draw the inference that the Defendant had cometo the decision to dismiss the Plaintiff as soon as the Defendant discovered that the Plaintiff had cancer at the time the Defendantemployed Mr. Leung Man To.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Although no teacher had ever applied for as long a period of leave as the Plaintiff, Ms. Liâs evidence shows that if a teacherapplied for maternity leave or for jury duty, that teacher would not be dismissed.  As regard jury duty the length of such leavedepended on the length of the trial and in some cases trials could last long.   As far as trials are concerned it is not easy toestimate the length of a long and complicated trial.   It seems on the above basis, the Plaintiff has established direct discriminationon the basis of his disability.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Legal Representative submitted further that the only defence that the Defendant can rely on in respect of directdisability discrimination is <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(2)</a> of the DDO.  The Defendant has not pleaded <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12(2)</a> of the DDO in its Defence, nor has it at any time in these proceedings sought to argue that the Plaintiff, because of his disability,would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of his job, or that, in order to perform the inherent requirements of thejob, the Defendant has unjustifiable hardship in order to provide him with reasonable accommodation to do so.  It is incumbent uponthe Defendant, in relying on this defence, to show what the inherent requirements of the job of a geography school teacher are, whichone (or more) of these inherent requirements the Plaintiff was said to be unable to perform, or what reasonable accommodation theDefendant could not provide.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I therefore find that the Plaintiff has established direct discrimination under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(a)</a> of the DDO.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In respect of this issue, the only argument advanced by the Defendantâs Counsel is that the principal reason why there was nodiscrimination under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6(b)</a> is because the relevant requirement or condition that is, the contractual terms in relation to absence in paragraphs 1 and 2 of SectionB of the Conditions of Employment for Teachers were justifiable under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">S6(b)(ii)</a> of DDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  He submits that these terms were justifiable because:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td align="left" width="5%" valign="top">(i)</td>                <td width="90%" align="left" valign="top" colspan="2">the job of a teacher is a special job.

Teacher having taken leave of whatever reason for more than 10% of his/her total number of classes in the month of leave shallbe considered having acted in breach of the fundamental term of his/her contract of service with the College.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  This term effectively would give the College a right to dismiss teachers who have to take sick leave beyond 10% of his/her totalnumber of classes in the month of leave owing to disability arising from illness.   It is clear that teachers who are disabled fromwork because of illness do not have a choice but have to take leave of absence from teaching.   It is clear that the proportion ofpersons with a disability who can comply with this condition is considerably smaller than the proportion of persons without a disabilitywho can comply with it.

Even were the objective legitimate, the means used to achieve the objective in the Absence and Substitutionclauses appear to me to be unreasonable as they would cause those who have to take leave for reasons beyond their control particularlythose who have to take leave as a result of disability, to lose their employment.     </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In relation to the 3<sup>rd</sup> factor that has to be considered, it seems to me that the reasonable needs of the pupils could easily be satisfied by the employmentof a substitute teacher as in this case.   Ms. Li gave evidence that if a teacherâs absence is temporary, his classes will be filledup by a supply teacher.  If his absence is long, then a substitute teacher is needed to replace him.  Ms. Li gave evidence that asearly as the 24<sup>th</sup> August, she employed Mr. Leung Man To to be a substitute to teach the Plaintiffâs classes.   Mr. Leung Man To was employed foran academic year on a probation period of 3 months.  Ms. Li stated that were the Plaintiff able to return to work within 3 monthsafter the start of term in the beginning of September, the Defendant would dismiss Mr. Leung.    At the time when the Defendant dismissedthe Plaintiff, the Plaintiff was expecting to return to work.   The three months period of probation of Mr. Leung Man To was notdue to end until 30<sup>th</sup> November.    There is no evidence that there would be great disruption to the students were Mr. Leung to resume duty at the end ofhis sick leave period.   The Defendant had not waited to obtain more information on the Plaintiffâs diability, including the seriousnessof his illness and what accommodation she would require to carry out his job when he could return to work and the extent of his abilityto carry out his original duties.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Under cross-examination by the Plaintiffâs Legal Representative, Ms. Li said that the school had not considered other alternativesbefore dismissing the Plaintiff.  The Defendant simply relied on the conditions imposed in the Conditions of Employment and dismissedthe Plaintiff, without giving any accommodation to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I agree with the Plaintiffâs Legal Representative that the conditions are not justified when balanced on the principles of proportionalitybetween the discriminatory effect upon the Plaintiffâs group and the reasonable needs of those applying the condition.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I find therefore that the Defendant has not shown the Absence and Substitution Terms to be justifiable.   The Plaintiff has establishedindirect discrimination against him as a person with a disability.  </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The 4<sup>th</sup> Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Legal Representative submits that under cross-examination, Ms. Li said that if any teacher has committed breachof contract, the Defendant would issue a warning letter.  Ms. Li said the Defendant had not issued such a letter to the Plaintiffbefore he was dismissed.  Ms. Li also said that the ISO2002 requires the School to have proper documentation.  I agree with the submissionof the Plaintiffâs Legal Representative that the fact that there is no warning letter is inconsistent with the Defendantâs casethat there was a fundamental breach.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Further, under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 41</a> and 83 of the DDO, the Absence and Substitution Terms are void and unenforceable.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Reliance on contract by the Defendant is not a defence to claim of unlawful discrimination.  Non-compliance of contract by the Plaintiffis also not a defence.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The 4th Issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is brought in tort and not in contract.   The Plaintiff claims damages being loss of income in the sum ofHK$240,000 for the period from 1 September 2002 to 31 December 2003.   The Plaintiffâs case is that the Defendant had paid himsickness allowance up to 30 September 2002.  However, in para. 32 of his witness statement he stated that the sickness allowancepaid to him in the sum of HK$21,000 had been deducted from his long service payment.  In effect the Plaintiff was not paid any sicknessallowance.   There are two limbs of this claim for loss of income, firstly, for sickness allowance during his sick leave period andsecondly for loss of income arising from not being able to resume work because of the dismissal.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I shall first address the time when the Plaintiff would have been able to resume work.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs evidence that he had requested to return to work from 1 November 2002 and he would be physically capableof carrying on the job as a teacher until end of December 2003.  The Plaintiff should be able to earn a monthly income at HK$15,000for this period had the Defendant not discriminated against him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  From the evidence produced by the Plaintiff it would appear that the Plaintiff was too optimistic in stating that he would havebeen able to return to work from the 1<sup>st</sup> November 2002, even though he may have wanted to do so.   He was still receiving radiation treatment until the end of November 2002(see page 80 of the BD-D).  He was also receiving chemotherapy in November, December, some days in January, in February, March andApril 2003.   He received a sick leave certificate to cover the period until 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2002.  No doubt the Plaintiff was eager to return to work and would have made an attempt to do so in the beginning of November2002.   To be realistic it would have been difficult for the Plaintiff to return to work until the end of November 2002 and thereafterhe was still receiving intermittent treatment for several days each month as can be seen in the medical records at pages 80 to 89of BD-D.  The treatment would have disrupted his working routine up to the beginning of April 2003.   He stated that he could havearranged to have the treatment at the end of the working day and go to work in the morning (see paragraph 30 of the Plaintiffâswitness statement).  This may well have been the case.  This may well be the case but as there is no medical evidence in supportof this I shall take a cautions approach.  The Plaintiff was active in May 2003.  It was then when he applied for help to the EqualOpportunities Commission to seek conciliation with the Defendant and at the failure of this to file this claim.    This supportshis contention that he was fit and able to work at least from then if not earlier.   In September 2003 he was well able to enrolin the Diploma in Finance course with the HKU School of Professional and Continuing Education (see official receipts at pages 338-9of BD-D).   He stated in evidence that he did the courses until the end of December when he suffered a relapse of the illness.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Having regard to the evidence aforesaid, to be fair to the Plaintiff and the Defendant he would at least have been able to workfor 8 months were it not for the dismissal namely from May until December 2003.    The Defendantâs Counsel stated that the Plaintiffâscontract of employment expired on the 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 and therefore there was no obligation for the Defendant to re-employ the Plaintiff beyond 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003.    As the Plaintiff enrolled in the course at Hong Kong University on the 1<sup>st</sup> September 2003 aforesaid, in all probability he was in good health at the end of 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003 and in all probability is likely to be re-employed by the Defendant as he has worked for the Defendant since 1<sup>st</sup> September 1988 and his performance at work was good.   Further, it would be presumed that the Defendant would not discriminate againstthe Plaintiff on the basis of his having suffered from cancer of the rectum in its decision as to whether to re-employ him for thenext academic year.    Having regard to the fact that this action is based on tort and not contract, and for the reasons aforesaid,I grant the claim of the Plaintiff for loss of income for the period that the Plaintiff would have been able to resume work from1<sup>st</sup> May 2003 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2003.   I take the 31<sup>st</sup> December as the last date of the period when the Plaintiff could claim for loss of income.    The reason is, the Plaintiff statedthat he was able to continue his course of studies at Hong Kong University until the end of December 2003 when he suffered a relapse(see paragraph 34 of the Plaintiffâs witness statement).   That period is a period of 8 months.   I grant the Plaintiff loss ofincome of 8 months at a salary of $15,000 per month.   This comes to $120,000.00.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The Plaintiff claims for sickness allowance from 1<sup>st</sup> October 2002 for the period when he was not able to return to work.   In relation to this, there is some reference by the Defendantthat the Plaintiff was not in continuous employment because he did not teach more than 18 hours per week.    By the time of the Plaintiffâsdismissal, the Plaintiff was employed on his contract dated 15 March 2002.   In this contract, it is stated that he would work 30periods per week.   The evidence shows that each period has 35 minutes.    30 periods multiplied by 35 minutes comes to 17.5 hours.   However, as we all know, a teacherâs working hours are beyond the actual number of hours in the classroom.   Going from oneclass to another would take at least a few minutes between classes.   Such time no doubt would be time spent in the school.   Itis common knowledge that a teacherâs job includes lesson preparation before each class.   Paragraph 10 of the Conditions of EmploymentFor Teachers at page 26 of BD-D state that, âTeachers shall participate in and prepare in advance notes to students.â   Suchtime and time to mark papers must be part of the working time of a teacher.    In the case where the Conditions of Employment requirethe teachers to prepare lesson notes in advance for students, such time spent in the preparation of lesson notes must be time ofwork of the teacher.    In my view, it is entirely debatable that the hours of the Plaintiffâs work each week are less than 18hours per week.   In view of the aforesaid, I find that the Defendant could not substantiate that the  Plaintiffâs contract ofemployment as at the date of his dismissal was not a continuous contract of employment.   The evidence shows that the contract ofemployment of the Plaintiff dated 22<sup>nd</sup> March 2002 on the balance of probability is a continuous contract of employment.     </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In the closing submission of the Defendantâs Counsel that there is no dispute that the Plaintiff would have been entitled to sicknessallowance were the Defendant found liable.   He submitted that the damages due to the Plaintiff would be 4/5ths of the Plaintiffâsmonthly salary from October 2002 to July 2003.    The Defendantâs Counsel contended that the Defendant was not liable to pay damagesbeyond 31<sup>st</sup> July 2003.    The issue as regards the period in which the Defendant has to pay damages for loss of income to the Plaintiff has beenaddressed above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  On the basis that the contract of employment is a continuous contract of employment, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 33</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> applies to this contract.   <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> states that the maximum number of paid sickness days that can be accumulated is 120 days.    The Plaintiff would only be entitledto 4/5 of 120 days of sickness pay.   The period from 1<sup>st</sup> September2002 to 30<sup>th</sup> April 2003 exceeded 120 days.    As the Defendant had deducted the sickness pay received by the Plaintiff when computing the Plaintiffâslong service pay paid to the Plaintiff, the effect of this is that the Plaintiff has not received any sickness pay.     </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I therefore assess compensation for loss of income in respect of sickness pay at 4/5 x 120/30 x $15,000 = $48,000.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In relation to the head of damages for injury to feelings, in the case of Vento v. Chief Constable of W. Yorkshire Police [2002]EWCA Cir. 1871 para 681.2, it was observed that three broad bands of compensation for injury to feelings could be identified.

Only in the most exceptionalcase should an award of compensation for injury to feelings exceed 25,000 pounds.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">2.</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The middle band of between 5,000 pounds and 15,000 pounds should be used for serious cases, which do not merit an award in the highestband.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">3.</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Awards of between 500 pounds and 5,000 pounds are appropriate for less serious cases, such as where the act of discrimination is anisolated or one off occurrence. . .</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The Defendantâs Counsel submits that the Plaintiffâs contract was not terminated when he first became ill.  The Defendant waiteduntil 21<sup>st</sup> October 2003.  Throughout the period from early August the Defendant had no indication as to when or whether the Plaintiff wouldreturn to work.  Not only did the Defendant comply with its statutory obligations by paying the Plaintiff sickness pay for September,and HK$108,000 as a long service payment, but it also paid the discretionary bonus for August 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The Defendantâs Counsel submits that the Defendant did attempt to conciliate with the Plaintiff.  The attempts were however unsuccessful.  The Defendantâs Counsel submitted that the damages for injury to feelings should be at the lowest band of between the Hong KongDollar equivalent of 500 to 5000 pounds.   It is noted that despite the conciliatory process, the Defendant has still not put intoplace an equal opportunities policy.   The Defendant did not pay sickness pay to the Plaintiff as such sickness pay as they renderedwere deducted from the Plaintiffâs long service pay (see paragraph 32 of the Plaintiffâs witness statement).   From the Plaintiffâsperspective the Defendant denied knowledge of his illness and maintained that the contract was void because he had failed to performthe contract on 1<sup>st</sup> September 2002.   There is no dispute that the Plaintiff had been a loyal and dedicated teacher and the Plaintiff stated that hefelt betrayed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  I accept the contention of the Defendantâs Counsel that damages should be at the lowest band aforesaid.  On the basis of all thefactors referred to me by the Defendantâs Counsel aforesaid, and the facts of this case, I find that the damages for injury tofeelings should be in the sum of HK$30,000.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The Plaintiff also applies for a declaration pursuant to secton 72(4)(a) of the Ordinance.   I grant this application and make adeclaration that the Defendant has committed an unlawful act of disability discrimination by dismissing the Plaintiff.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In relation to the application for an apology, it is obvious from the submission of the Defendantâs Counsel that this is not acase where the Defendant is willing to offer an apology.   In such cases, Li CJ in Ma Bik Yung and Ko Chuen state in para 52 of thejudgment the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âBefore an order for an apology could be made against an unwilling defendant, s.72(4)(b) requires the court to be satisfied thatan apology is a reasonable act for the defendant to perform in the circumstances of the case in question.   The requirement of âreasonableâin the provision may not necessarily lead to the conclusion that an order for an apology can never be made against an unwilling defendant.   With an unwilling defendant, it may well be that an apology, which will be an insincere one, would usually not be a reasonableact for him to perform.   In this context, it must be borne in mind that there are many other remedies at the courtâs disposalwhich could be considered.  But there may be <i>rare</i> cases where the court could be satisfied that an apology, albeit insincere, would be a reasonable act for the defendant to perform. Further, in these <i>rare</i> cases, enforcement could not be said to be futile or disproportionate and contrary to the interests of the administration of justice. The circumstances in these <i>rare</i> cases, including the degree of gravity of the defendantâs unlawful conduct as well as the nature and extent of the plaintiffâsloss and damage, would have to be exceptional.â     </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Having considered the fact that the Defendant was not contrite and repentant and had never indicated that it was, an apology wouldtherefore be an empty gesture.   I am of the view that this is not such a rare case where an apology should be extended in the circumstancesaforesaid.    By this judgment and decision of the Court, the discrimination against the Plaintiff that had caused the distress tothe Plaintiff has been condemned and the conduct of the Defendant has been outlawed.   The community has made clear that such conductis not to be tolerated in our society.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The damages and the Declaration made by this Court go some way to alleviate the injury to feelings caused to the Plaintiff.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Judgment for the Plaintiff against the Defendant in the sum of $198,000.00 together with interest thereon from date of Writ to dateof judgment at judgment rate and thereafter until payment at judgment rate.
