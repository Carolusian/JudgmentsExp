TheLane was at all material times part of the common part of Peony House. The Plaintiff (â<b>Wong</b>â) claims property right over the Lane by reason of adverse possession. The Defendant, which is the Incorporated Owners of PeonyHouse (â<b>IO</b>â), resists the claim and puts forward a counterclaim for, among other things, possession.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The Lane</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Peony House (North Block) (â<b>the Building</b>â) was surrounded by Tai Kok Tsui Road to the east, Ka Shin Street to the south and Fuk Chak Street to the north.  The west sideof the Building is now an open yard  (â<b>the Open Yard</b>â) fenced by a wall running along the entire width of the Building between Ka Shin Street at one end and Fuk Chak Street at theother end.  The Lane is sandwiched between the other side of the wall and No.8 Ka Shin Street.  It is identified and coloured redin the Block Plan annexed to Wongâs pleading [1].</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  At the moment, the side of the Open Yard facing Ka Shin Street is occupied by a restaurant business while the other side facingFuk Chak Street is closed by a stainless steel door with lock.  There is no dispute that the door was erected by the IO.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The whole width of the Lane at the Ka Shin Street end (slightly less than 5 feet) is currently occupied by Wong to operate his businessof plumbing, electric and decoration work as well as door key prescription.  The upper storey of the shop is roughly constructedby corrugated iron, frames, boards and tarpaulin. The 2-storey structure extends into the Lane by about 40 feet where the back ofthe shop is now sealed, though not air-tight, by a steel board.  There is also no dispute that the board was erected by the IO.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The rest of the Lane is now in the open air with a stainless steel door with a lock at the end of the Lane facing Fuk Chak Street. The door was erected at about the same time as the steel board sealing the back of the shop by the IO.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Therefore the Lane is now effectively divided into the shop front portion (â<b>Front Portion</b>â) and the rear portion (â<b>Rear Portion</b>â).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In the Rear Portion, there are now the following features:  There are 3 door openings with the remains of wooden and stainless steeldoors on the side of the wall in the Lane.  The corresponding openings on the other side of the wall in the Open Yard have by nowbeen sealed by concrete.  There are also 2 manholes with cast iron covers on the ground of the Lane.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The current layout and features of the Lane and its vicinity are respectively indicated in the agreed plan [2], which was preparedafter the site visit by this court and the parties on the first day of the trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The dispute</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In 2008, the IO commenced proceedings in the Lands Tribunal against Wong (LDBM 219/2008).  The parties then agreed to stay the proceedingspending the determination of the rights over the Lane by the court and hence the present action was commenced in the following year.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The parties used to act in person.  Since they became legally represented, the original homemade pleadings have been amended.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Essentially Wong claims that he first entered into possession of the Lane in 1987-1988 when the 2-storey structure erected at theFront Portion already existed.  He carried out various works to the structure and the rest of the Lane, including installing an irondoor at his shop front facing Ka Shin Street as well as an iron gate at the end of the Rear Portion facing Fuk Chai Street.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Wong says since 1988, he has been operating his business at the shop occupying the Front Portion and used the Rear Portion for storage. In 2008, the IO gained entry into the Rear Portion, removed the structure and properties put there by Wong, and replaced his irongate at the end facing Fuk Chak Street by the current stainless steel door.  Wong has since been kept out of the Rear Portion.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Wong claims declaratory relief as regards his right over the Lane by reason of adverse possession.  He also claims damages for theloss of properties that were removed from the Rear Portion by the IO in 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The IO denies that Wong has been in occupation of the Lane since 1987-1988.  Instead numerous other persons also occupied the Laneduring the same period of time.  The IO denies liability for the alleged removal of Wongâs properties from the Rear Portion.  In2009, the IO received a notice from the Buildings Department (â<b>BD</b>â) to demolish the structure occupied by Wong.  Despite requests, Wong refused to comply.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The IO puts forward a counterclaim against Wong for possession of the Lane together with injunction to remove the structure fromthe Front Portion; and to restrain him from occupying the Lane.  The IO also claims against Wong for rent or mesne profit and damagesfor the alleged trespass of the Lane.  As pleaded, the counterclaim is brought on the basis of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34i.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34I</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap.344</a> (â<b>BMO</b>â)</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a> (âLOâ)</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The starting point is the LO.

Though the exact timing is in dispute, this happened before the commencement of legal proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Hence the starting point of counting 20 years backward for the purpose of ascertaining the alleged adverse possession slightly differsin the case of the Front Portion and the Rear Portion.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The principles</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  A person claiming to be in adverse possession must be shown to have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess(<i>animus possidendi</i>): see <i>Wong Tak Yue v Kung Kwok Wai &amp; Anor</i> (No.2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 55</a>, approving the principles enunciated by Slade J in <i>Powell v McFarlane</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2038%20P%20%26%20CR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 38 P &amp; CR 452</a> and adopted in <i>R v Sceretary of State for the Environment ex p Davis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2061%20P%20%26%20CR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 61 P &amp; CR 487</a> and <i>Buckinghamshire County Council v Moran</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20Ch%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] Ch 623.</a></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The intention to possess involves the intention in oneâs own name and on oneâs own behalf to exclude the world at large, includingthe paper owner, as far as is reasonably practicable and so far as the process of law will allow.  The question of intention to possessis one of facts.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The principles were subsequently approved by the English House of Lords in <i>JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 419.</a>  In particular, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â36. â¦â¦ The question is simply whether the defendant squatter has dispossessed the paper owner by going into ordinary possessionof the land for the requisite period without the consent of the owner.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">38. â¦â¦ there will be a âdispossessionâ of the paper owner in any case where (there being no discontinuance of possession bythe paper owner) a squatter assumes possession in the ordinary sense of the word. Except in the case of joint possessors, possessionis single and exclusive. Therefore if the squatter is in possession the paper owner cannot be. If the paper owner was at one stagein possession of the land but the squatterâs subsequent occupation of it in law constitute possession the squatter must have âdispossessedâthe true owner for the purposes of Schedule 1, paragraph 1 [<i>i.e., <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a> in the Hong Kong context</i>]â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">42. â¦â¦ Once it is accepted that in the Limitation Acts, the word âpossessionâ has its ordinary (being the same as in the lawof trespass or conversion) it is clear that, at any given moment, the only relevant question is whether the person in factual possessionalso has an intention to possess: if a stranger enters on to land occupied by a squatter, the entry is a trespass against the possessionof the squatter whether or not the squatter has any long term intention to acquire a title.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Court of Final Appeal confirmed the above principles in the subsequent case of <i>The Incorporated Owners of San Po Kong Mansion v Shine Empire Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%2010%20HKCFAR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2007) 10 HKCFAR 588</a> (at Â§7).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the recent case of <i>Yu Kit Chiu &amp; Ors v Chan Shek Woo</i>, unrep., CACV 137/2010, the Court of Appeal summarised the above principles (at Â§Â§15-22).  The apparently different approachesof the English House of Lords and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal towards the significance of the squatterâs indication ofwillingness to pay rent (Â§23) did not arise for determination in <i>Yu Kit Chiu</i>.  Nor in the present case.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>The evidence</u></b></p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Wongâs case</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  According to Wong, by the time when he came to occupy the Lane, the 2-storey structure at the Front Portion was already there; buthe found it deserted.  He started to repair the same for his own use.  He had the ground of the entire length of the Lane raisedby concrete.  The photographs produced show that the ground had indeed been raised by layer of concrete above the pavement level. The observation was verified during the site visit.  As mentioned, Wong also had the metal door erected at the shop front facingKa Shin Street and the metal gate erected at the Fuk Chak Street end of the Lane.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Wong added that he also discovered a working telephone and received telephone bills that were addressed to a Madam Huen To, includinga final notice to settle telephone charges in arrears.  For convenience, he started to use the telephone until he changed the registrationinto his own name in the following year.  He does not know Madam Huen To.  Nor has he ever seen her.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Wong also explained his understanding that the adjacent No.8 Ka Shin Street used to be split into 2 shop premises, namely, 8A and8B, and thus resulting in 2 individual electricity meters.  By the time he came to occupy the Lane, No.8 had already been occupiedby a single tenant so that the meter for No.8B, then registered in the name of one Au Koon Wah, became surplus.  Wong started touse that surplus meter and subsequently changed the registration into his own name.  He does not know Au Koon Wah.  Nor has he everseen him.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Copies of various types of documents were produced, including personal mails, business registration certificate and documents fromthe Government as well as public utility companies.  They show that Ground Floor, No.8 Ka Shin Street (or sometimes Side Door orSide Shop or Side Lane thereof) was reported to be Wongâs address.  The earliest one in time that was addressed to Wong was datedJanuary 1988.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  During the site visit, one should also be fairly impressed that the condition and contents of the 2-storey structure that housesthe shop evidence many years of occupation.  An example was that beneath the advertisement banner on top of the shop front, the oldersignboard of the shop was found.  It advertised the same business of Wongâs and the long expired 6-digit business telephone number.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Wong called numerous witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Lo Sheung Wa was the casual worker Wong engaged then to carry out the ground raising work mentioned above.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Chan Kin Leung was the worker then engaged by Wong to erect the metal door at the shop front and the metal gate at the Fuk ChakStreet end.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Lin Sai Kau is an old friend of Wongâs for over a quarter of a century.  He testified about his visits to Wongâs shop sinceits opening in 1988.  He distinctly remembered his visit to his shop before the 4 June incident in 1989.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Hui Kin Hing used to live on the roof of No.18A of Ka Shin Street.  He testified that in about 1988-1989, he contracted Wong toinstall water pipes and to apply for water meter there at the fee of HK$5,000.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As neighbours, Hui Kin Hung and Tang Kin had been passing by Wongâs shop regularly.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Tsui Lai Hing has been a resident at the vicinity since 1986.  She testified that it was about 1988 when she first engaged Wongfor his service.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Chan Sui Cheong is the rent collecting agent of the landlord of No.8 Ka Shin Street.  He confirmed that Wongâs shop had been therefor approximately 20 years.  The shop effectively blocked the Front Portion so that no one could pass through.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As to the Rear Portion, Wong said that part was in the open when he started occupying there.  Towards the end of 1989 and the beginningof 1990, he erected a canopy of about 6 feet long to shelter the building materials, tools and equipment that he stored there.  Hecould identify the rust marks on the wall indicating the positions of the metal frames then erected to support the canopy.  The canopywas removed by the IO while he was not at the shop one day in late 2008.  On the same occasion, his properties there were removed,the end of the shop sealed up, his metal gate at the Fuk Chak Street end removed and replaced by the current metal door.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Besides Lo Sheung Wa and Chan Kin Leung, another witness Lo Shu Fong testified that he had been to the Rear Portion to collect andto return materials, tools and equipment when Wong contracted him to work during the few years after the shop was opened.  All ofthem gave evidence that the Fuk Chak Street end of the Lane was closed with a locked metal gate.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>The IOâs case</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The IO contends that apart from Wong, there were other persons occupying the Lane in or since 1987. These persons included MadamHuen To, Au Koon Wah, Madam Lui Soo Kum and Lui Man Sing.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As mentioned, the names of these persons appeared on the bills produced by Wong.  Worth mentioning are the two Luiâs.  It onlytranspired from the land search produced during the trial that they were and still are the registered owners of No.8 Ka Shin Street.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Upon her application, I gave leave to Miss Yang to further cross examine Chan Sui Cheong on matters arising out of the discoveryof the identities of the owners of No.8 Ka Shin Street from the recently produced land search.  Chan was thus re-called; but onlyto confirm that Lui Soo Kum is his sister in law and the sister of Lui Man Sing.  Both of them have emigrated to the New York, USAfor decades.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Chan added that when he took over the rent collecting responsibility from his predecessor approximately 20 years ago, Wongâs shopwas already there.  He was not in a position to tell the prior situation of No.8 Ka Shin Street, including the prior split of thepremises into A and B as Wong explained.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The IO called one witness, Ho Man Lai, who has been the Vice Chairman of the IO since 2008, though he has been member of the managementcommittee since 2004.  Ho did not really have personal knowledge about the alleged occupation of the Lane since 1987 by Madam HuenTo, Au Koon Wah and the two Luiâs.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Obviously the IO managed to refer to these names simply because of their appearance in the documentary evidence disclosed by Wong. As mentioned, Wong gave direct evidence in this respect which, in my view, is not effectively contradicted by the IO.  As far asthe two Luiâs are concerned, the evidence of Chan Sui Cheong actually confirmed Wongâs case.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Point was taken as to whether the metal gate erected at the Fuk Chak Street end of the Lane by Wong was at all times locked up. According to Wong, the metal gate was secured by padlock but every now and then found damaged.  In my judgment, occasional breachof the security or unwanted invasion does not compromise the assertion, degree and intention of continuous control and possessionof land as oneâs own.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  It was suggested on behalf of the IO that other people also had access to the Rear Portion.  The IO were referring to the residentsof and visitors to the structures that once existed in what is now the Open Yard.  It was suggested that the door openings on thedividing wall were evidence of the means through which these people obtained access to the Rear Portion.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Such suggestion is not part of the IOâs pleaded case.  Further, there is no actual evidence to the alleged effect.  Ho of theIO did not claim to have witnessed the alleged use of the door openings as means of access into the Lane by these people.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  There is also lack of evidence of the primary facts in support of such inference either.  Even assuming that there were residentsof and visitors to the structures that used to exist in what is now the Open Yard, I find it hard to draw the inference as contended,in the absence of any evidence of the configuration of the structure in relation to the door openings then.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  As the Front Portion was occupied by Wongâs shop; and if the Fu Chak Street end of the Lane was closed by the metal gate erectedby Wong, one wonders what sort of access to the Lane through the doors openings could have been.  Speculation with a view to somehowjustifying the once existence of these door openings does not assist the IO, particularly when the time when they came to exist isunknown too.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Referring to the 2 manholes located on the ground of the Rear Portion, it was suggested that the workmen engaged on behalf of theIO had the liberty to enter there for maintenance over the past decades.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Again the allegation does not transpire from the current version of the pleading.  Ho Man Lai of the IO gave no direct evidencein support.  Further the suggestion that this kind of entry into the Rear Portion freely in past decades is difficult to reconcilewith his evidence that that portion of the Lane was constantly lumped with a lot of things and rubbish.  He managed to recall oneoccasion when Fuk Chak Street was flooded; and the workmen from the Drainage Services Department did enter the rear portion of theLane to unblock the manholes.  Wong actually referred to that isolated occasion too in his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It was suggested on behalf of the IO that serious consequence to the maintenance of the drainage of the Building could result fromthe dispossession of the Lane from it.  Assuming that access to the manholes would be necessary for this reason, the fact that theIO has been dispossessed of the Lane does not necessarily mean that it cannot have any right whatsoever to access there.  Whethersome sort of easement could exist in the circumstances is not an issue in this case so that I do not venture to say anything aboutthat.  Whether certain arrangement could be made by agreement is also something that need not be ruled out.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The IO argued that the structure that houses Wongâs shop was an unauthorised one; and its condition is far from safe.  It is suggestedthat the continued existence of the structure will pose danger to the people in the neighbourhood.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  That the structure was an unauthorised one is properly beyond dispute.  Nevertheless, whilst the structure is a piece of evidenceof the continuous possession of the Lane by Wong in the past; its continued existence is not a pre-requisite to Wongâs establishmentof his right and interest over the Lane in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  What the court is asked to do is to declare his right and interest in the Lane, not the right in keeping the structure there.  Whetherthe structure needs to be removed is a matter for the Building Authority and Wong.  If injury or property damage is caused by thecondition of the structure to any third party in the interim, it will be the liability of Wong, not the IO.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  At the end, the determination of the issue of adverse possession is a question of fact.  Wong and his witnesses told the court whatthey saw and knew.  Their evidence impressed me as being candid and straightforward.  I cannot say the same in respect of the witnessfor the IO whose ability to give direct evidence of what happened during the relevant period of time is doubtful.  On balance, Iprefer the evidence of Wong and his witnesses in case of discrepancy with the evidence adduced on behalf of the IO.  I find on theevidence that Wong has as a matter of fact been in possession of the Lane since 1987.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  It is interesting to note that at one point, even the IO (by its original pleading) admitted that it came to realise that the Laneformed part of the common parts of the Building only upon receipt of the BD notice to demolish the unauthorised structures therein May 2008.  As Ho Man Lai of the IO eventually admitted in court, the current iron door was erected by the IO at the Fuk Chak Streetend of the Lane subsequently in about September 2008.  I find that Wongâs possession of the Lane since 1987 has all along been,and understood by Wong to be, in his own name to the exclusion of the world at large in the absence of intervention until what happenedin 2008 as mentioned above.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Section 34I of the BMO</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Section 34I of the BMO confers a right of action in case of conversion of any common part of the building that will be treated asbreach of the deed of mutual covenant.  There is dispute as to whether this provision targets someone like Wong who is neither aco-owner of the Building and nor a party to the governing deed of mutual covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Miss Yang submitted that the section applies to Wong, relying on <i>The Incorporated Owners of No.27A Chatham Road, Kowloon v Mr Lee or Unlawful Occupier (Lee Kai Kong (æåå) &amp; Anor</i>, CACV 2238/2001 (2 August 2002); <i>The Incorporated Owners of Kwan Sen Mansion v So Kwai Chor</i>, HCMP 134/1994 (6 June 2002); and <i>The Incorporated Owners of Man Hong Apartments v Kwong Yuk Ching &amp; Ors</i>, CACV 498/2000 (27April 2001) whereas Mr Yin persuasively submitted otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In view of my conclusion on the facts against the IO, a conclusion on this question of construction is not called for.  In any event,for the purpose of the claim for possession, occupation rent or mesne profit or damages for trespass, as prayed for in its pleading,reliance on section 34I of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap.344</a> is actually unnecessary, even if not inappropriate.  The right of the IO to commence proceedingson behalf of all the owners of the Building is conferred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 16</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">18</a>.  The cause of action against a trespasser, who is not a co-owner, of the common part of the Building is in tort.  These would havebeen all the IO needed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  For the above reasons, I conclude that by the time the IO sought to recover the Rear Portion by actual re-entry in 2008 and theFront Portion by legal proceedings, Wong has already been in possession of the Lane for not less than 20 years.  Pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(2)</a> of the LO, the owners of the Building, and the IO, ceased to have any right of action to recover the Lane from Wong.  Pursuant to<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a>, the title of the owners of the Building in the Lane has been extinguished.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Loss and damage</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  This is the claim for loss and damage as a result of the IOâs trespass of the Lane since September 2009.  The claim is not particularisedin the pleading or Wongâs both statements.  It was not until a week before the trial did Wong, through his solicitors, sent tothe solicitors for the IO the particulars of the alleged loss and damage.  A copy of that letter was inserted during the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  It is alleged that the materials, tools and equipment belonging to Wong that had been removed by the IO in 2009 cost HK$12,867. Wong also claims a sum of HK$23,500 being the cost of repair to be carried out after the recovery of the Rear Portion.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Some 40 items of materials, tools and equipment have allegedly been removed from the Lane without his knowledge in 2009.  Thereis no convincing evidence, if at all, how Wong managed to do the itemisation a week prior to the trial, in the absence of any recordor document.  Wongâs evidence in court regarding their identification, quantification and suggested value bears all the hallmarksof arbitrariness.  I am not at all impressed.  Accepting that the incident happened and as a result of which Wong has lost his properties,yet in the absence of substantive proof, I am only prepared to award him nominal damages of HK$100.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The cost of repair is said to be incurred for erecting the canopy and the metal gate at the rear portion of the Lane.  However,even on his own land, it is doubtful whether Wong will be authorised to keep the existing structure that houses the shop front, letalone erecting the canopy and the metal gate as he may wish.  Whilst he may be entitled to claim for the value of the canopy andthe metal gate lost, I am not prepared to award him the cost of putting up new ones.  In any event, the amounts to be incurred areagain arbitrary and put forward in the absence of quotation whatsoever.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In view of my conclusion, the IO had no right to erect the steel door at the Fuk Chak Street end of the Lane in the first place. Wong is entitled to demand its removal.  But I make no order as to Wongâs prayer for the key to it.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><u>Order</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I grant the declarations that pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(2)</a> of the LO, the owners of the Building, and the IO, ceased to have any right of action to recover the Lane [3] from Wong; and pursuantto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a>, the title of the owners of the Building in the Lane [3] has been extinguished.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  There shall be judgment for nominal damages in the sum of HK$100 with interest thereon at the judgment rate from the date of writuntil payment.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The counterclaim is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The IO shall pay Wongâs costs of this action, including his costs of defending the counterclaim and any costs reserved.
