One was the "KapitanShvetsov", Russian owned, outward-bound from Bangkok, going down-stream. The other was the "Nanta Bhum", Singaporean owned, goingup-stream towards Bangkok.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The "Kapitan Shvetsov", a tanker of 4268 gross tons, carrying a cargo of molasses, was very extensively damaged in the collisionand had to be beached. She became a constructive total loss.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The "Nanta Bhum", a container vessel of 11,079 gross tons, then engaged on a weekly container-feeder service between Bangkok andSingapore, was also damaged in the collision, but not nearly as extensively as the "Kapitan Shvetsov". She was able to proceed toSingapore under her own steam. Temporary repairs were effected in Singapore and she was soon able to resume her weekly feeder serviceto Bangkok.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> At the time of the collision both vessels had local Thai pilots on board. The "Kapitan Shvetsov" was holed and a quantity of molassesleaked from her hull: The Singapore port authorities had to incur expense in the clean-up operation. Further, two Thai tugs, eachtowing three or four barges laden with cargo, were also involved in the incident. Some of the barges and their cargo were damaged.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The above, in essence, are the undisputed facts concerning the incident which gave rise to legal proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">The follow-up</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Soon, a whole host of professional people from different parts of the world became involved in the casualty: Lawyers, surveyors,assessors, insurers and their agents, to name a few.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Shortly after the collision lawyers from Singapore on both sides arrived at the scene and interviewed the Thai witnesses. Salvorsfrom Singapore were hired; likewise, an agency company from Bangkok was engaged to provide services to the Russian-owners to dealwith matters like crew accommodation and repatriation. Eventually, the salvageable molasses on board the "Kapitan Shvetsov" was transferredto a sister-ship owned and operated by the Russian owners. The Russian ship was eventually sold for scrap, with the sale handledfrom Singapore.</p>    <p class="heading">Civil liability arising from the incident</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> As can be seen from the brief recital of facts above, a host of civil liabilities might well have been incurred by the owners ofthe two vessels as a result of the collision: To third parties such as the Singapore port authorities for the clean-up operation,to cargo interests on board the "Kapitan Shvetsov", to third parties such as the Thai barges and the owners of cargo on those bargesand, of course, to each other.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Clearly, in respect of the resolution of disputes concerning such liabilities, the "natural forum" is the Thai court: that is theforum with which any action brought to determine such liabilities has clearly "the most real and substantial connection" (to useLord Keith's expression in the <u>Abidin Daver</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 AC 398</a> at 415-F). Thailand is the country where the incident took place, where the liability to compensate others for the injury occurred.Many of the witnesses are Thais: The two pilots, the masters of the two tugs and their crews and almost all the crew members of the"Nanta Bhum". Apart from the eye-witnesses who would be testifying in their native language if the proceedings were in Thailand -a factor strongly favouring Thailand as the natural forum - there is this additional fact: There was, apparently, some radio communicationbetween the bridge of the "Kapitan Shvetsov" and the tug going down-stream and the contents of that conversation might be relevantto the collision.</p>    <p class="heading">The parties' choice of forum</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Here, neither of the ship-owners (or their insurers) wanted the proceedings brought in Bangkok. The Singapore owners (whose directorsand shareholders are not Singaporeans but Thais) wanted the proceedings in Singapore. The Russian owners - and the owners of thecargo carried on board the Russian ship - wanted the proceedings in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Singapore and Hong Kong have similar admiralty jurisdictions in that, for claims for damage done by a ship, jurisdiction can be conferredon the local court by the arrest of a "sister ship": in Hong Kong, this springs from s12B(4)(ii) of the Supreme Court Ordinance,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap 4</a>. As both owners operated vessels in South East Asian waters and had agents in both Singapore and Hong Kong, it was purely amatter of time before proceedings could be instituted in their chosen forum. As it happened, the Singapore owners were able to actfirst: but only by a few days: by the arrest in Singapore of the "Kamensk-Uralskiy". On 23 January 1996 an action in rem was institutedby the Singapore owners in Singapore seeking damages and an indemnity against third-party claims from the Russian owners. In HongKong, the Russian owners issued their writ on 29 January 1996, pursuant to the arrest of the sister ship "Deja Bhum", seeking identicalrelief from the Singapore owners.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Pausing at this point, and viewing the position objectively, what does one see? Each party was seeking to establish tortious liabilityagainst the other and, as Lord Justice Robert Goff said in <u>The "Albaforth"</u> [1984] 2 LI LR 91 at 96:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If the substance of the alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts coulddisplace the conclusion that the courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> For an illustration of this principle see <u>The "Wellamo"</u> [1980]2 LI LR 229 where two ships navigated by pilots speaking Swedish collided off Stockholm: Sheen J held that Sweden was the naturalforum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The natural forum here was Bangkok, but, as mentioned earlier, neither party wanted to go there. Each party preferred its own chosenforum and was exercising an undoubted right of access to that forum: a right which the court will not lightly disturb: see, for example,the observations of Lord Goff in <u>Spiliada Maritime Corporation</u> v. <u>Cansulex Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> at 476G citing authorities to this effect:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the court hesitates to disturb the plaintiff's choice of forum and will not do so unless the balance of factors is <i>strongly</i> in favour of the defendant."

Plainly, this inherent jurisdiction will not be lightly exercised. In <u>The Atlantic Star</u> itself Lord Wilberforce, adverting to the long history and wide international reputation of the Admiralty court in England, saidat p469F:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"Secondly, there has not been brought to notice any case - at least of an action in rem - where, in a case where foreign proceedingsare pending, and the plaintiff in one suit is defendant in the other, a stay has been granted.

I do not find either in their facts or in any statement of principle in them a general rule which would cover this case. <i>But they do vouch the proposition that a very clear case is needed to justify a stay, where a plaintiff is (properly as to jurisdiction)suing here and that the mere fact that there are proceedings abroad is not enough."</i> (Emphasis added).</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="heading">Steps taken to assert the parties' rights</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> On 25 March 1996 the Russian owners made an application in the Singapore High Court to stay the Singapore action in favour of HongKong as the <i>forum conveniens</i>. About a week later, the Singapore owners reciprocated in Hong Kong: They took out a motion on 3 April 1996 to stay the Hong Kongaction in favour of Singapore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> As it happened, the Singapore court marched to a quicker pace. The Russian owners' application to stay the Singapore action was heardon 12 April 1996, long before the Singapore owners' application in Hong Kong came on for hearing. The Russian owners' applicationfailed. No reasons were given and no formal order has been drawn up, so it is not possible to determine the reasons for the Singaporecourt's decision. Directions were then made in Singapore for the Singapore owners' claim to proceed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In the meanwhile the Singapore owners' motion here to stay the action was listed for hearing and it came eventually before WaungJ who heard it on three consecutive days - 4th, 5th and 6th September 1996. By that time the Singapore action was at a relativelyadvanced stage. The Russian owners defended, of course, that action, placing the whole blame for the casualty on the "Nanta Bhum".But, consistent with their stance that the respective claims should be tried in Hong Kong, they did not counter-claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Waung J's judgment</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> By his judgment dated 17 October 1996 the judge allowed the Singapore owners' application.

(Emphasis added).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> By "the actions of the parties" the judge meant the sending of lawyers, surveyors and salvors from Singapore after the collision,and the institution of proceedings in Singapore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It is difficult to see how if Bangkok was the natural forum it could be "displaced" by such actions, as the judge thought. The insurersof the ships are respectively the Swedish Club for the "Nanta Bhum" and the United Kingdom P&amp;I Club for the "Kapitan Shvetsov",and lawyers could well have been despatched to Thailand from London or Hong Kong. As it happened, they came from Singapore: but theythen rendered their professional services in Thailand. The salvage operators were despatched from Singapore because they were basedthere.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The other factor which, as the judge thought, "displaced" Bangkok as "the most natural forum" was the impending trial of the actionin Singapore. The proceedings were at a relatively advanced stage. By the time the judge heard the Singapore owners' applicationhere, pleadings had closed in Singapore and the Singapore owners had filed their list of documents. The judge considered it a "positivedisaster" and "the nightmares of nightmares" that there should be parallel proceedings in Singapore and Hong Kong (p17J-M of hisjudgment).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> With respect to the judge, his concerns are overstated. The courts have never viewed the possibility of parallel proceedings in thatlight. As earlier mentioned, Lord Wilberforce, in <u>The Atlantic Star</u> at p469F, referred to the instances, starting with <u>The Janera</u> [1928] P.55, where the existence of parallel proceedings was no ground for staying the English action in rem under the court's inherentjurisdiction. As Sheen J said in <u>The "Vishva Abha"</u> [1990]2 LI LR 312 at 315:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Shipowners often have to face litigation in different parts of the world, and for a variety of reasons, these shipowners have gotto face litigation arising out of this incident in a number of jurisdictions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In <u>The "Tillie Lykes"</u> [1977] 1 Lloyd's R 124, arising out of a collision between two ships in the Pacific west of Central America, there were parallelproceedings in the United States District Court for the Canal Zone and in England. The defendant in the English proceedings issueda summons to stay the action on the grounds that (i) it was inherently undesirable to have parallel proceedings in respect of thesame collision; (ii) it was open to the plaintiffs in the English proceedings to counterclaim in the United States action and (iii)the United States court was the more convenient forum. The application was dismissed. Brandon J held that the effect of the decisionin <u>The "Atlantic Star</u>" was that the mere existence of a multiplicity of proceedings was not to be taken into account as a disadvantage to the defendant;a clear case of <i>oppression</i> or <i>vexation</i> had to be made out to justify a stay; and although those words had to be given a wide meaning no case of oppression or vexation hadbeen made out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> What <u>The "Tillie Lykes"</u> establishes, once again, is that a party's right of access to the court should not be lightly displaced.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> As regards the practicalities of parallel proceedings in the present case, the situation appears to be this: the Singapore trial,fixed for April this year, will determine liability as between the parties. The Singapore owners may or may not proceed to an assessmentof damages: depending, obviously, on the court's determination of the degree of blame.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In the meanwhile, the determination of liability by the Singapore court would in effect resolve the same issue in the Hong Kong proceedingsas well. The Singapore judgment will clearly give rise to an issue estoppel in the Hong Kong proceedings: see <u>Carl Zeiss Stiftung</u> v. <u>Ravner and Keeler Limited (No. 2)</u> [1967]1 AC 853 at 909.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In terms of convenience for the Thai witnesses, it makes little practical difference whether they fly to Singapore or Hong Kong totestify.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> What it boils down to is this. Assuming there be parallel proceedings, then (i) the judgment of the Singapore court will determinethe issue of liability in both jurisdictions; (ii) if there is an apportionment of blame, then each party will proceed to establishthe quantum of damages and obtain judgment in the respective jurisdictions for the full amount, without any set-off; (iii) they willthen look to the fund put up respectively by the Swedish Club and the P&amp;I club for satisfaction of their judgments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There will, obviously, be a certain amount of duplication of effort: but the overlap may not be great because the respective damagesclaims are quite distinct. It is likely, for instance, that there will be some dispute concerning the quantum of the Russian ship'ssalvage claim in the Hong Kong proceedings, but this will obviously play no part in the Singapore proceedings. It is difficult tosee why such an outcome should be the "nightmares of nightmares" as envisaged by the judge.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The judge was also heavily influenced by the following facts in favour of Singapore as the natural forum: (i) the "Nanta Bhum" fliesthe Singapore flag; (ii) the owner is a Singapore company; (iii) the "Nanta Bhum" is managed by a Singapore company; (iv) the operationof the ship is controlled by another Singapore company; (v) the ship maintains a regular feeder service between Singapore and Bangkok.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> But, undoubtedly, similar facts will apply regarding the Russian ship vis-a-vis its port of Nakhodka. This does not make Nakhodkathe natural forum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> What is stated above is probably sufficient to dispose of the appeal in favour of the Russian owners. The convenience of Singaporeas a forum to the Singapore owners is, objectively viewed, simply not enough to displace the Russian owners' right of access to theHong Kong court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> But, when one moves to consider stage (II) in <u>the Adhiguna Meranti</u> test, the scales tip even more heavily in favour of the Russian owners.</p>    <p class="heading">Stage (II) Test</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> As mentioned earlier, the "Kapitan Shvetsov" was damaged far more extensively than the "Nanta Bhum". On the material before the court,the Russian owners' claim amounts to approximately US$2.6 million. Additionally, there is the claim by the "Kapitan Shvetsov" cargointerests amounting to US$494,000. The claim by the "Nanta Bhum" amounts to US$552,000. Assuming, for instance, that responsibilityfor the collision were apportioned 50-50, the net effect after set-off would be that the Singapore owners owe the owners of the "KapitanShvetsov" and the cargo owners a total of US$1,271,000. And this is where the question of "juridical advantage" in stage (II) ofthe <u>Adhiguna Meranti</u> test comes in.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> It is common ground that the <i>Convention Relation to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships (Brussels 1957)</i> applies in Singapore. This severely limits the liability of the Singapore owners in relation to claims by the Russian owners andcargo owners against the "Nanta Bhum". The limit of liability under the 1957 Convention relates to the tonnage of the "Nanta Bhum"and this works out to the sum of US$933,000. Whatever the amount of damages which the courts might ultimately award to the Russianowners and the cargo owners, they can only look to the fund of $933,000 in Singapore to be shared amongst themselves rateably insatisfaction of their claims if those claims were prosecuted in Singapore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The same limitation of liability prevailed in Hong Kong until 1993. However, pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/434" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Limitation of Ship Owners' Liability) Ordinance</a> of that year, Hong Kong has adopted the 1976 Convention which has a much higher ceiling of liability: higher than the claims of theRussian owners and cargo owners combined.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The practical effect of the difference in limitations in the two jurisdictions is this: If the Russian owners were held ultimatelyto be as much as 60% responsible for the collision, and their claim for damages were accordingly reduced, then after set-off theyand the cargo owners would be able to fully satisfy their claims out of the Singapore limitation fund. Anything less, they wouldsuffer financially; and if the "Nanta Bhum" were ultimately held 100% to blame for the collision then the shortfall to the Russianowners would exceed US$1.5m.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> On any view of the matter, this is a considerable juridical disadvantage to the Russian owners. It flows purely from the fact that,as a result of the collision, the Russian ship was much more severely damaged than the Singapore ship.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The judge, however, concluded that the Russian owners failed the stage (II) test in <u>Adhiguna Meranti</u> for two reasons.</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%">Because the Russian owners had not put before the court "cogent evidence" that they would in fact suffer the alleged juridical disadvantage;and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%">the possibility of the limitation under the 1957 Convention being broken by the owners' "actual fault or privity".</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%">As to (1), the judge said this:</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">"The evidence before the Court does not convince me that there is any strong likelihood that the Russian Owners will eventually succeedin establishing that the preponderance of the blame will rest with the Singaporean ship. I certainly cannot say on the evidence beforeme that the Russian owners are bound to have a finding in their favour where they could recover (disregarding limitation) more thanUS$1 million."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The judge appears to have accepted counsel's submission that the evidence from the Russian owners concerning the circumstances ofthe collision was unsatisfactory. It was based upon hearsay.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The judge erred in this regard. It was no part of his function to try the issue of liability upon affidavit and it would have beenmost undesirable had he attempted to do so. That is a matter for trial. All that the parties can properly do at the interlocutorystage is to assert their respective claims: which is what the Russian owners did, through their solicitors. They cannot be criticisedin this regard.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The juridical disadvantage to the Russian owners lies in this simple fact: because their claim alone is over five times higher thanthat of the Singapore owners (and, coupled with the cargo owners' claims, is over six times) the Singapore limitation of liabilitywas very likely to bite deeper for them than for the Singapore owners.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The judge in conclusion said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"All it is possible to say on the present evidence before me is that there is a possibility (on most unsatisfactory evidence) thatthe Russian Owners might find that eventually after a trial and various appeals that they are entitled to recover from the SingaporeanShip substantially more than US$1 million."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Leaving aside the judge's comment on the quality of the evidence - which was unwarranted - this conclusion should have led him logicallyto find that the Russian owners would suffer a considerable disadvantage if forced to prosecute their claim in Singapore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> As to (2) above, the judge thought it significant that under the 1957 Convention the limitation of liability would only apply ifthe Singapore owners were able to show that the collision occurred without "actual fault or privity" on the part of their board ofdirectors or shareholders. Under the 1976 Convention the limitation can only be broken by proof of "personal act or omissions committedwith intent to cause .... loss, or recklessly and with knowledge at such loss would probably result".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Whilst this is a consideration, it does not weigh much in the scales. There is no material before the court to show that the ownerswere personally involved in anyway. The judge never suggested that this alone was sufficient to tip the scales against the Russianowners. In this regard he was plainly correct.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The position boils down to this. The Russian owners have properly invoked the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong court for the adjudicationof their claim. They have a right to have their claim determined by the Hong Kong court. In principle, this right cannot be lightlydisturbed. The Singapore owners have not brought proceedings in a forum which is natural to the action; that is, the forum with whichthe action has the most real and substantial connection. Additionally, there is a considerable juridical disadvantage to the Russianowners if they were forced to prosecute their claim in Singapore; the interests of <i>both</i> parties and the ends of justice do not demand that they be driven from their chosen forum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Once this point is reached, the conclusion is inevitable that the Singapore owners' motion to stay is ill-founded and should havebeen dismissed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I would allow this appeal, discharge the judge's order and dismiss the Singapore owners' application to stay the Hong Kong proceedings.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I would also make an order nisi that the Singapore owners should pay the costs here and below.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><strong>Liu JA:</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The material facts are fully rehearsed by the Vice-President. I content myself with the following resume: On 16 January 1996, a Russianship and a Singaporean ship collided in a narrow dredged channel in the Chao Phraya River off Bangkok. Negotiation had been conductedon the forum for resolving the claims and cross claims. On behalf of the appellants (the Russian shipowners), London or Hong Kongwas offered. Six days after the collision, the respondents (the Singaporean shipowners) indicated their preference for the Singaporecourt, with an explanation that Singapore exercised like Admiralty jurisdiction and was closest to the scene, vessels and owners.Eight days after the collision, the Singaporean shipowners commenced an Admiralty action in rem against the Russian Shipowners inthe Singapore High Court. The Russian shipowners did not counterclaim in the Singapore action for damage to and eventual loss oftheir ship allegedly caused by the negligent navigation of the Singaporean ship, but almost immediately following i.e. 13 days aftercollision, they instituted an Admiralty action in rem in Hong Kong for their damages. The Russian shipowners also applied for a stayof the Singaporean action, but their application was not granted and there was no appeal. The Singaporean shipowners applied to andsuccessfully obtained from Waung, J. a stay of the Russian shipowners' Hong Kong action. From that order of stay, the Russian shipownersappealed. The Singaporean action is expected to be tried in April 1997. The Hong Kong action was stayed on 17 October 1996. Consequently,the Singaporean shipowners had not filed their Preliminary Act in Hong Kong. The owners of the cargo in the Russian ship have suedthe Singaporean shipowners in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Under the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (the 1976 Convention), the Russian shipowners would haveenjoyed in Hong Kong a higher claim limit in excess of US$3 m. Singapore adhered to the International Convention relating to theLimitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships, 1957 (the 1957 Convention) which set a lower liability limit of US$933,000.In this appeal, there would seem to be cogent evidence from the Russian shipowners of a "reasonably arguable best case" of equalblame. See <strong>The "Moscanthy"</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 LL.L.R. 37</a> at p. 44, per Brandon, J. On that basis, the claims of the Russian shipowners and the cargo owners of their ship would reach US$1,271,000.The ceiling of the 1957 Convention was US$933,000. The shortfall would be US$338,000. The 1957 Convention ceiling might to-day bemore readily breached if only the Singaporean shipowners could be shown to have been willfully at fault e.g. a defective gear, failureto notify the master of a previously uncharted rock, insufficient crew training in using radar etc. Evidently, a total avoidanceof the low 1957 Convention liability limit would be infinitely more beneficial than a mere given opportunity to seek to disapplyit. Moreover, at the hearing before Waung, J. no mention was made of any likely breaking of the 1957 Convention limit. The collisionoccurred in Bangkok. Under the Thai law, liability for the damage was unlimited.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Witnesses on board the nearby tugs would have to come from Bangkok. The local pilots of both ships were Thai. The crew of the Singaporeanship were also Thai. Expenses were incurred in cleaning up the polluted Thai river. The Russian ship was beached in Bangkok. It wasrefloated and salvaged, but ultimately had to be sold as scrap in Bangkok. Bangkok was thus the natural forum which had the mostreal and substantial connection with the collision, particularly as regards the claims of the Russian shipowners.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Broadly speaking, the Russian shipowners' stance was that since neither party would relish the prospect of litigating in Bangkokas the natural forum with which the collision claims had the closest and most real and substantial connection, both shipowners werefree to select a forum more convenient or commercially advantageous to themselves and that the Russian shipowners' decision to bringan action in their chosen forum in Hong Kong should not be overridden. In conclusion, leading counsel for the Russian shipownerscontended that "if neither party (sought) to litigate in the [most] natural and appropriate forum and each (chose) to sue the otherin a forum which (was) the most advantageous or most convenient from its own point of view, the Court should not stay an action properlybrought", hence no stay should be granted. Counsel's contention would have the effect of impinging upon the need to compare separatefora because every forum chosen independently of the mutually discarded natural forum, however disconnected or objectively unsuitable,would then have to be regarded as a most appropriate forum. That clearly runs counter to the basic principle observed in a long lineof cases, including two of our own. Before considering jurisdical advantages, the court would invariably have to compare the materialfactors of fora, natural or chosen, for determining the one objectively suitable for the ends of justice. <strong>See The Atlantic Star</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] A.C. 436</a> at p. 454G, per Lord Reid; <strong>MacShannon v.

The Singaporean procedure of excluding hearsay was no longerpressed upon us as a jurisdical disadvantage in this appeal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> In <strong>Spiliada,</strong> supra, at p. 465 E/F, Lord Templeman observed that the "place of incident was not always decisive", but Bangkok did have the mostreal and substantial connection with the claims arising from the collision and was the natural and appropriate forum. The partiesdid not treat Bangkok as a forum in play and in the Singaporean shipowners' Hong Kong application for a stay, Waung, J. was obligedto determine whether the other available forum in Singapore was clearly more appropriate for the trial of also the Russian shipowners'claims. In balancing the competing features, the Judge cannot be rightly criticised for describing Bangkok as, in effect, a "theoretical"natural forum. The principle observed in <strong>Spiliada</strong> and considered in three stages by Hunter J.A. in <strong>Adhiguna Meranti</strong> was accepted on all hands before Waung, J. For the competing fora, the test has always been either "the natural forum" or "a clearlymore appropriate forum". In <strong>European Bank v. Punjab Bank,</strong> supra, neither India nor Singapore was considered "the natural forum" or "a clearly more appropriate forum", and the selection ofthe English Court was affirmed. At p. 365, of the three competing fora Stephen L.J. had this to say: The Judge "was right to lookfor a natural forum, or a clearly more appropriate forum, ..... He was, in my judgment rightly, not addressing his mind exclusivelyto the question whether one of those countries was <strong>the natural forum</strong> but whether it was <strong>the appropriate,</strong> or <strong>more appropriate, forum,</strong> or <strong>'the more natural forum'".</strong> (Emphases supplied). The mere existence of a most natural and appropriate forum is not decisive. Where, as here, the most naturalforum was rejected by both parties, the court must necessarily go on to consider whether parallel proceedings in two separately selectedfora were justified and, if not, which one was more appropriate. In the latter scenario, the authorities cited have not led to anydiscernible erosion of the fundamental concept which calls for an objective identification of the appropriate or clearly more appropriateforum so that matters could best be resolved for the interests of justice. What must also not be lost sight of is that the court'sdiscretion in granting a stay should be cautiously exercised upon considering all the relevant circumstances.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In <strong>Caltex Singapore Pte. Ltd. and Others v. BP Shipping Ltd.</strong> [1996] 1 LILR 286 and 19 December 1995 (unreported), Clark, J.'s decision was made on the particular facts in that case where liabilitywas admitted in an action commenced in Singapore by the defendant, BP Shipping Ltd. The plaintiffs brought parallel proceedings inLondon for the damage done to their Singapore jetty on account of the significantly greater limit of liability under the 1976 Convention.Clark, J. seemed to have, in a broader sense, compared the quality of justice in different jurisdictions by reference to what heregarded as an English public policy of upholding the modern 1976 Convention. We know not what the local, legislative and enforcementconditions in Singapore were, and Clark, J.'s comparison of quality of justice cannot be supported and should not be encouraged.See <strong>Abidin Daver,</strong> supra p. 410F-H, per Lord Diplock. Waung, J was right in refusing to allow himself to be unduly persuaded by the rationale of Clark,J. As a matter of fact, what weighed heavily in the balancing exercise in <strong>Caltex</strong> was the difference in the Convention limits, which would have deprived the owners, operators and users of the damaged Singaporeanjetty of so much greater a sum in claims that it would be unjust to stay their English action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Waung, J. should not have characterised the Russian shipowners' claims as less than "a strong probability" or proceeded to evaluatethe evidence of the Singaporean shipowners as "strong". But he took into account the post-incident activities, the matters affectingconvenience and expense, the respective location of the parties' businesses and the progress of the Singaporean action, all in thefactors set out in his judgment. He was able to conclude that the Singaporean shipowners' claims and the Russian shipowners' claimsshould not be adjudicated in different jurisdictions. In prosecuting the Russian shipowners' claims in Hong Kong after liabilityis established in Singapore, some duplication could not be avoided. The judge also acknowledged the Singaporean action as havingdeveloped to the stage where it would have some impact upon the dispute between the parties. See <strong>de Dampierre v. de Dampierre</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20AC%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 A.C. 92</a> at p. 108 C-D, per Lord Goff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> It was quite unnecessary for Waung, J to go further. But legal fees in this territory have not been known to be moderate. Given theexpected burdensome additional legal costs, the possible shortfall of US$338,000 (HK$2.6m. approx.) arising from the difference betweenthe limits of liability could hardly justify a second set of legal proceedings in Hong Kong. In the <strong>"Vishva Abha"</strong> [1990] 2 LILR 312, at p. 315, the limits were Â£1.5 m. as against Â£ 367,000, and the difference of Â£1.1 or over HK$14 m. was suchthat "it would be a grave injustice to deprive [the plaintiffs] of their right to litigate" in London. <strong>Caltex</strong> is another case of a significantly greater limit of liability to the tune of some US$3.57 m. or HK$27.8 m. (US$9,389,115 as againstUS$5,750,000).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Waung, J. followed the guidelines in <strong>Adhiguna Meranti,</strong> supra. in forming his balanced view. His appreciation of some of the other authorities cited is very much at issue, but neverthelesshe correctly decided against parallel proceedings and proceeded to compare one forum with another for determining which one was themore suitable and convenient. Barring inaccuracies and errors, there was ample affidavit evidence for the Judge to form the viewthat the Singaporean shipowners had an "overwhelming powerful case" for a stay. In his balancing operation, the Judge favoured Singaporeas clearly the more appropriate forum. Further, given the relatively insubstantial difference between the limits of liability, anothertrial in Hong Kong, albeit probably only in quantum, was palpably undesirable. In counsel's skeleton argument to this court, it wassubmitted for the Russian shipowners that "in terms of practical convenience and expense alone, there (was) little to choose objectivelybetween Hong Kong and Singapore". It would seem, therefore, doubly difficult to demonstrate that the Judge's preference in his balancingexercise was plainly wrong. It was "pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge" and we "should be slow to interfere". <strong>Spiliada</strong> supra p. 465 F-G, per Lord Templeman. Also, the jurisdical advantage in terms of Convention limit is hardly substantial. Waung, J.disregarded it, though, for the wrong reason, but the balanced view in his analysis of forum cannot be faulted. If I had to exerciselike discretion on account of his misdirections, I would be driven to grant a stay. It would therefore be futile to set aside theJudge's decision for reaching the same conclusion in a rehashed balancing operation. I would dismiss this appeal with an order nisifor costs against the appellants.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><strong>Cheung J:</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by My Lord, Litton V-P.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><strong>Litton V-P:</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The result is that, by a majority, the appeal is allowed, the judge's order of 17 October 1996 is set aside, the Singapore owners'motion of 3 April 1996 stands dismissed and there will be an order nisi that the costs of the appeal and of the proceedings in thecourt below will be paid by the respondents (the owners and/or demise charterers of the ship "Nanta Bhum").</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Henry Litton)</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="34%">(B.
