One may find that as a matter of history several people have been at fault and that if any one of them had acted properly the accidentwould not have happened, but that does not mean that the accident must be regarded as having been caused by the faults of all ofthem. One must discriminate between those faults which must be discarded as being too remote and those which must not. Sometimesit is proper to discard all but one and to regard that one as the sole cause, but in other cases it is proper to regard two to moreas having jointly caused the accident.

To a philosopher - a term which I use in no disparaging sense, for what is a philosopherbut one who, inter alia, reasons severely and with precision? - to a philosopher, the whole legal doctrine of responsibility mustseem anomalous. To him, if event C could not occur unless each of two previous events -A and B - had preceded it, it would be unmeaningto say that A was more responsible for the occurrence of C than was B, or that B was more responsible for its occurrence that wasA. The whole modern doctrine of <brs_term brs_term_id="7" brs_term_type="2">contributory negligence</brs_term>, however, proceeds on the <brs_term brs_term_id="8" brs_term_type="2">contrary assumption</brs_term>. If not there would be no question of apportionment. But the fission between law and <brs_term brs_term_id="106" brs_term_type="9">strict</brs_term> logic goes deeper than that.

On the contrary, the words &quot;as the result of&quot; in section 1 of that statute impliedly preserve the doctrine,the assertion of which your Lordships have more than once coupled with an admonition that, if the conditions for its applicationoccur, a judge sitting alone should assume the mantel and the mentality of a <brs_term brs_term_id="188" brs_term_type="9">jury</brs_term>, and should take what is called a &quot;broad common-sense view,&quot; in deciding whether one of the causes (there may be two ortwenty) is the &quot;real&quot; causes.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="91"><p><a class="para" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> Of course in <strong>Stapley v.

Parties and witnessesmust enjoy <brs_term brs_term_id="148" brs_term_type="9">privilege</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="146" brs_term_type="9">immunity</brs_term> from suit for what they say or do <em>in the ordinary course of any <brs_term brs_term_id="143" brs_term_type="9">proceeding</brs_term> in a court of justice.</em> On the other hand, Mr. Allman-Brown was correct to point out that neither the Plaintiff nor the DPC was a party or witness in thecriminal <brs_term brs_term_id="53" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> against Mr. Ho. I am not prepared to extend the application of the <brs_term brs_term_id="145" brs_term_type="9">immunity rule</brs_term> to <em>potential witnesses or <brs_term brs_term_id="13" brs_term_type="4">peripheral parties</brs_term>.</em> This is because the rule by nature offends the very purpose of the law which is to enable people to obtain remedy and <brs_term brs_term_id="152" brs_term_type="9">relief</brs_term>. The rule may be allowed the most restrictive scope of operation only. The rule cannot be extended without further justification.To draw an analogy, counsel <brs_term brs_term_id="241" brs_term_type="9">on his feet <em>in court</em></brs_term> is <brs_term brs_term_id="240" brs_term_type="9">entitled to</brs_term> <brs_term brs_term_id="18" brs_term_type="2">absolute privilege</brs_term> but that <brs_term brs_term_id="149" brs_term_type="9">privilege</brs_term> is lifted the moment counsel walks away from the precincts of the court. For another analogy, legislators are protected by <brs_term brs_term_id="150" brs_term_type="9">privilege</brs_term> during debates in the legislative chamber but that <brs_term brs_term_id="151" brs_term_type="9">privilege</brs_term> does not cover <brs_term brs_term_id="153" brs_term_type="9">deliberations</brs_term> elsewhere. I cannot see why a person who is no more than a potential witness or peripheral party behaved outrageously and maliciouslymay claim better protection than that available to legislators and counsel.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="111"><p><a class="para" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> It is therefore a foregone conclusion that, in my view, with all due respects, the English Court of Appeal in <strong>Silcott</strong> was too ready to throw a protective blanket around rogue policemen. The <brs_term brs_term_id="155" brs_term_type="9">public interest</brs_term> to protect those who might be falsely accused of misfeasance upheld by Simon Brown LJ is based on the unjustified assumption thatthe courts are unable to discern false accusations. It is perhaps no accident that the <strong>Silcott</strong> <brs_term brs_term_id="202" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> did not find its way into the <brs_term brs_term_id="242" brs_term_type="9">official report</brs_term>s. I do not believe I am bound by the <brs_term brs_term_id="243" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> of the English Court of Appeal. In so far as the English Court of Appeal based its <brs_term brs_term_id="244" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> on public policy or <brs_term brs_term_id="156" brs_term_type="9">public interest</brs_term>, I would like to think that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are just as capable of deciding what is bestfor this <brs_term brs_term_id="154" brs_term_type="9">jurisdiction</brs_term> as a matter of public policy or <brs_term brs_term_id="157" brs_term_type="9">public interest</brs_term>. The public policy or <brs_term brs_term_id="158" brs_term_type="9">public interest</brs_term> for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be, in my humble opinion, to have the doors of justice wide open for casesalleging blatant perversion of justice to be pursued.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="112"><p><a class="para" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> Both grounds relied upon by Mr. Westbrook found no favour with the court, the Defendant's <brs_term brs_term_id="245" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term> was <brs_term brs_term_id="246" brs_term_type="9">dismiss</brs_term>ed.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="113"><p><a class="para" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> Mr. Allman-Brown asked for costs to be paid <brs_term brs_term_id="160" brs_term_type="9">forthwith</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="15" brs_term_type="2">certificate for</brs_term> two <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="15" brs_term_type="2">counsel</brs_term> for the Plaintiff. Mr. Westbrook objected to payment <brs_term brs_term_id="161" brs_term_type="9">forthwith</brs_term> and did not think two counsel were justified. Specifically on payment <brs_term brs_term_id="162" brs_term_type="9">forthwith</brs_term>, counsel for the Defendant advised me that the Court of Appeal has recently indicated that an order for payment of costs <brs_term brs_term_id="163" brs_term_type="9">forthwith</brs_term> amounts to a penalty which may be inflicted only sparingly.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="114"><p><a class="para" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> The question of <brs_term brs_term_id="247" brs_term_type="9">penalty costs</brs_term> prompted counsel for the Plaintiff to point out that this summons to <brs_term brs_term_id="165" brs_term_type="9">strike out</brs_term> has the effect, even if unintended, of an attrition exercise. The matter is in my discretion. I think justice is better served byordering payment of costs of the <brs_term brs_term_id="248" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term> to the Plaintiff <brs_term brs_term_id="164" brs_term_type="9">forthwith</brs_term>. The matter does involve an important question of law - the applicability of the Silcott extension. It is fit for two counsel andI so certify.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="115"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="116"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="117"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="40%"></td></brs_paragraph>            <brs_paragraph id="118"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="60%">(Z.E.
