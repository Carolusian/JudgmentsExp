The action unfolded in the followingmanner.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On 21st December 1987, two private companies incorporated with limited liability under Hong Kong law, namely, Extramoney Limited("Extramoney") and its corporate grandparent and ultimate holding company Carrian Holdings Limited (in liquidation) ("Holdings")(collectively "the Plaintiffs") commenced proceedings by way of a generally indorsed writ claiming as against their auditors, a firmof certified public accountants practising under the name or style of Chan, Lai, Pang &amp; Co. ("the Defendants") damages for, interalia, negligence in the audit of the Plaintiffs' accounts for the year ended 31st December 1980 ("the 1980 Accounts").  In the fiveyears or so that intervened between the issue of the writ and the completion of the trial on 8th April 1993, the claim underwentnot inconsiderable metamorphosis. In its final incarnation which materialised on or about l0th March 1993 by way of a statement ofClaim with red and green amendments and violet deletions, the Plaintiffs rely on a number of different causes of action which I shallsummarise below. I use the expression "deletion" since Mr. John Griffiths Q.C. who appears for the Plaintiffs was anxious to avoiddescribing the last edition of the Statement of Claim as a further re-amendment but sought instead to characterise the changes inviolet as a convenient aide-memoire defining those allegations in the statement of Claim with which he no longer proposes to proceed.The nomenclature is a matter of no moment and I propose now to refer in some detail, as I think such course would serve by way ofa useful clarificatory exercise, to the parties' final pleaded positions.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The CLAIM</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiffs complain, first and foremost, of negligence ("the Principal Claim") by the Defendants in their audit of the 1980 Accountsof respectively Extramoney and Holdings (the latter to the extent that Extramoney's aforesaid accounts are consolidated in the groupaccounts of Holdings for that year) in that on 8th January 1982 they reported without qualification such accounts to be true andfair when, according to the Plaintiffs, Extramoney's 1980 Profit and Loss Account purporting to show net profits before tax of someHK$140.5 million was incorrect insofar as it overstated the same by an amount of HK$101,688,640.10 (dubbed "the fictitious profit"by the Plaintiffs but which, in the interest of lowering the temperature of the debate during the hearing and for another reasonwhich will later become apparent, I have referred at the trial and will continue herein to refer to as âthe Disputed Profitâ).</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Such alleged overstatement is said to arise from the incorrect inclusion in Extramoney's 1980 Profit and Loss Account of a journalentry purporting to state that Extramoney had made a profit of that magnitude on the sale by one George Tan (âMr. Tan"), beingthe Plaintiffs' 100% beneficial owner, on behalf of Extramoney of 14,133,920 quoted shares in Holdings' publiclyÂ­listed subsididaryCarrian Investment Limited ("CIL"), whereas, according to the Plaintiffs, no such profit had in fact been made and Extramoney hadno records to verify the said entry. The Plaintiffs contend that, had the Defendants exercised reasonable care in their audit ofthe said accounts and due diligence in pursuing obvious inquiries and investigations in the course of the same, they would have discoveredthe Disputed Profit to be fictitious whereupon they would, as reasonably careful auditors, either have reported that the 1980 Accountsdid not give a true and fair view of Extramoney's state of affairs or, alternatively, qualified their report to reflect the factthat they could not verify the making by Extramoney of the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The above factual allegations are said to give rise to further or alternative complaints of breach of contract and/or breach of statutoryduty by the Defendants qua auditors vis-a-vis the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the Defendants' breaches of duty as aforesaid, whether the same be tortious, contractualor statutory in nature, they suffered loss for which they claim damages by way of redress, such loss consisting of (a) overpaymentof profits tax (HK$22.9 million having been paid by Holdings on Extramoney's behalf to the Inland Revenue) which, to the extent ofHK$16,778,625 together with a 5% late payment surcharge of HK$838,931 thereby totalling HK$17,671,556 (âthe Overpaid Profits Tax"),arose from the Disputed Profit and (b) a dividend of HK$90 million (âthe Dividendâ) distributed by Extramoney to its shareholders,namely, Carrian Finance Limited ("Finance") and Carrian Realty Limited ("Realty"), which latter sum was, to the extent of HK$74,315,006,not covered by Extramoney's presumably real, as opposed to its allegedly fictitious, profits.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Apart from the aforesaid allegations which were advanced by way of the Principal claim, the Plaintiffs also complain, by way of amendmentto the pleadings introduced on 1st November 1991, of the receipt on 20th May 1981 by the Defendants from Holdings of HK$1.2 millionby way of a Holdings' cheque signed by Mr. Tan purporting to be an overtime or bonus payment in relation to the internal auditingof the Carrian Group ("the Subsidiary Claim"). The Defendants' fees in respect of the audit of Extramoney's 1980 Accounts were bycomparison a modest HK$28,000. Since the Defendants had apparently performed no overtime work over the relevant period and were,furthermore, not the internal auditors to the Carrian Group, the Plaintiffs say that any payment, whether described as "bonus" orotherwise, constituted a gratuitous payment for no consideration and made, to the Defendants's knowledge, in breach of trust or fiduciary,duty owed by Mr. Tan to Holdings. In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs (according to the pleadings although, strictly speaking, theclaimant should more properly be Holdings) seek to recover the same from the Defendants as constructive trustees.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Apart from a declaration of constructive trusteeship in the manner aforesaid, the Plaintiffs also claim by way of relief, among othermatters, an account of profits made by the Defendants as a result of their alleged receipt of and/or conversion of trust property,judgment in the sum of HK$17,617,556 (being the Overpaid Profits Tax), damages, interest pursuant to statute and costs. Additionally,Extramoney seeks to recover from the Defendants HK$74,315,006 (being the amount of the Dividend paid out but not allegedly coveredby actual profits).</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The DEFENCE</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Defendants have structured a multi-layered response to the Principal Claim, as will be evident from my summary thereof set outbelow. Whilst conceding the existence of a duty on their part to exercise reasonable care and skill in expressing a view in theirauditors' report as to whether or not the 1980 Accounts gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Extramoney, the Defendantsdeny, first and foremost, any negligence or breach of duty. They further deny that Extramoney's 1980 Profits were overstated or thatthere was no record which verified the crucial journal entry of HK$101,688,640.10. On the contrary, they say that they were, in thecourse of their audit, furnished with documents and information which verified the aforesaid entry, namely, statements of a stockbrokerage firm known as Okasan International (Asia) Limited ("Okasan") showing market acquisitions of CIL shares which, when latersold, generated the Disputed Profit, Extramoney's internal memoranda and journal entries as well as information orally supplied byMr. Tan acting for the Plaintiffs. In the circumstances, the Defendants positively assert that the Disputed Profit arose from purchasesand sales of CIL shares by Mr. Tan for and on behalf of Extramoney in 1980.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Further or alternatively, the Defendants say that, in the discharge of their duties as auditors, they were entitled to and did relyon the documents and representations submitted by Mr. Tan on behalf of the Plaintiffs wherefor the latter are estopped from denyingthe existence of the Disputed Profit; alternatively, prior to the signing of the auditors' report, the share transactions were ratifiedby the directors of Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> A third major line of defence was erected by the Defendants in the form of a contributory negligence argument whereby they contendthat, if there existed any loss (which they deny as a fact), the same was caused or contributed to by negligence and/or misrepresentationon the part of the Plaintiffs. The Defendants also rely on the fact that neither Plaintiff has taken any step to recover the OverpaidProfits Tax from the Inland Revenue and, further, that no-one among Extramoney or its corporate shareholders and directors and thethree joint liquidators of Holdings (all partners of Messrs. Ernst &amp; Young, certified public accountants) took any steps to recoverthe Dividend from Holdings or cause the latter to account as constructive trustee or recover the loss by way of tax or dividend fromany director, fiduciary or constructive trustee, wherefor Extramoney had failed to mitigate its loss.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> A fourth major line of defence relied on by the Defendants arose from their assertion Extramoney had suffered no loss as a resultof the payment of the overpaid Profits Tax and the Dividend since it had received by return valuable consideration in the form of(a) a debit entry in Holdingsâ account with Extramoney of HK$63,523,683.47, (b) 3,417,000 CIL shares from Mr. Tan valued at HK$37,621,939.05and (c) the benefit of margin interest paid by Mr. Tan on Extramoney's behalf of HK$543,017.58.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> A fifth major line of defence erected by the Defendants revolves around the concept of causation. They say that if there existedany negligence or breach of duty on their part (a fact which they deny), the same in no way caused the payment of the Overpaid ProfitsTax or the Dividend. Put alternatively, they say that the payment of the Overpaid Profits Tax and the Dividend were voluntary actson the part of Holdings in no way caused by the Defendants' alleged negligence or other conduct. Finally, the Defendants pray inaid the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> All the above pleas made by the Defendants are intended to meet the Principal Claim founded on alleged negligence or other breachof duty. I turn now to the Defendants' answer to the Subsidiary Claim based on the former's receipt, supposedly for no consideration,of HK$1.2 million by way of a Holdingsâ cheque signed by Mr. Tan allegedly in breach of trust or fiduciary duty owed to Holdings.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Defendants deny that the payment was gratuitous or, made in breach of trust or fiduciary duty or constituted in any way a misapplicationof Holdings' funds. They readily concede that the same could not properly be described as an overtime or bonus payment but asserton the contrary that the money had nothing whatsoever to do with the discharge of their duties as auditors to the Plaintiffs or,indeed, their firm as such, but arose rather from the individual three partners' private dealings with Mr. Tan as members (togetherwith others) of an investment syndicate (âthe Syndicate") which was interested in or around May 1981 in acquiring certain quantitiesof CIL shares.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> On their case, one Tsang Kit ("Mr. Tsang"), being the sole proprietor of a stock brokerage firm known as Hung Fat Securities Company("Hung Fat") which managed the market investments of the Syndicate asked Raymond Chan ("Mr. Chan"), being the senior partner of theDefendants, to approach Mr. Tan to buy on the Syndicate's behalf two lots of respectively 328,000 and 2 million CIL shares. Mr. Chandid so on 12th May 1981 after he and Mr. Tan had agreed on a purchase price of HK$8 per share, payment to be made on 19th May 1981.  On or about the latter date, two cheques made out for respectively HK$2,624,OOO (with the name of the payee left blank) and HK$16million (expressed, upon Mr. Tan's request, to be payable to Extramoney) were delivered to Mr. Tan pursuant to the agreement. Subsequently,on 20th May 1981, the Defendants on behalf of the Syndicate drew under protest a third cheque in the sum of HK$1.2 million, afterMr. Tan (on the apparent instigation of certain members of his family) had requested a price increase or premium for the block of2 million CIL shares, and handed the same to Mr. Tan on the understanding that he would attempt to persuade his family members toadhere to the original agreement, the idea being that, should he be successful in his persuasive efforts, the extra  HK$1.2 millionwould be refunded to the Syndicate. Mr. Tan's powers of persuasion apparently yielded fruit and the money was indeed returned byway of a Holdings' cheque dated 20th May 1981 signed by him for HK$1.2 million and made payable to the Defendants.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Defendants admit the characterisation in the relevant payment voucher PWL 627/81 ("the Payment Voucher") of the HK$1.2 millionas being overtime or bonus payment for the internal auditing of the Carrian Group to be incorrect but assert that neither they northe individual partners authorised or knew at the material time of the use of such description. When Mr. Chan subsequently discoveredthe matter, he immediately drew the same to the attention one Bentley Ho (probably best described as Mr. Tan's right hand man inthe running of his various companies) and indicated that a correction was required. In the circumstances, the Defendants deny thatthey are in possession of trust property and say, alternatively, that if there were any breach of trust or fiduciary duty, the individualpartners and the Syndicate were bona fide purchasers of the sum of HK$1.2 million for value without notice.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Also prayed in aid by way of further or alternative defences to the Subsidiary Claim are a plea of limitation and another of lachesrendering it inequitable for the Plaintiffs currently to pursue the Subsidiary Claim. The latter arises from the fact that the amendmentto the Statement of Claim which, introduces the Subsidiary Claim was made, as I have earlier mentioned, on 1st November 1991 beingover 10 years after the occurrence of the events in question, further that (according to the Defendants) it is no longer possibleto subpoena or obtain the records of Hung Fat, its proprietor Mr. Tsang having been declared bankrupt in 1982 whereafter he couldnot be traced and, finally, that the Defendants or its individual partnersâ ability to pursue claims as against the other membersof the Syndicate had been irrevocably prejudiced by the lapse of time.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The COUNTERCLAIM</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Apart from defending themselves against the principal and the Subsidiary Claims, the Defendants have instituted a Counterclaim againstthe Plaintiffs as respectively 1st and 2nd Defendants to the Counterclaim, the Attorney General representing the Commissioner ofInland Revenue ("the Commissioner") as the 3rd Defendant to the Counterclaim, Finance, Realty and Carrian Joint Venture Limited ("JointVenture") (the first two being shareholders and directors with the last being a director of Extramoney) as respectively the 4th,5th and 6th Defendants to the Counterclaim, and the three liquidators of Holdings, namely, Thomas Brian Stevenson, Wilfred KeithTimso and John William Crawford, all partners of Messrs. Ernst and Young, as respectively the 7th, 8th and 9th Defendants to theCounterclaim     (collectively "the Liquidators").    </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The Defendants seek, first of all, a declaration that Extramoney had made the Disputed Profit as a matter of fact and that the profitstax and surcharge had been properly paid. Alternatively, on the facts pleaded by the Plaintiffs and/or as set out in the Plaintiffs'solicitors' letter to the Commissioner dated 31st March 1987 contending, among other matters, that Extramoney's profits were mis-statedto the extent of the Disputed Profit by Mr. Tan acting in fraudulent breach of his fiduciary duty owed to the Plaintiffs, that "atthe very most, Extramoney may have received a gift of capital [from Mr. Tan] but did not produce profits of that sum", that the assessormade his assessment on the basis of fraudulent information and that, throughout, the applicable appeal period, Mr. Tan controlledthe Plaintiffs so as to prevent them from taking steps to correct the assessment, the Defendants now seek a declaration that Extramoneyand Holdings are entitled to repayment by the Inland Revenue of such tax and surcharge and an order that they prosecute an appealfrom such assessment to the Board of Review with due diligence.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In the further alternative, the Defendants seek declarations that, upon payment to the Plaintiffs of any sum which I may order themto pay in this action, they be subrogated to the rights of the Plaintiffs in pursuing the said appeal and be entitled to all refundsof tax and surcharge.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As regards the Counterclaim mounted against the corporate shareholders and directors of Extramoney (respectively Finance, Realtyand Joint Venture), the Defendants say that since they were all controlled and 100% beneficially owned by Mr. Tan, the latter's knowledgeis to be imputed to them such that, if the Disputed Profit were truly fictitious as contended by the Plaintiffs, they were all fullyaware of such fact and of the fact that the payment of the Dividend out of non-existent profits constituted a breach of fiduciaryduty owed to Extramoney. Since Holdings was also beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. Tan, the Defendants contend that Holdingswas likewise fully aware of such facts and received the Dividend as a constructive trustee and, insofar as Finance, Realty and JointVenture knowingly assisted in the transfer of the Dividend to Holdings, each of them became a contructive trustee of the same.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> By similar reasoning, the Liquidators are joined as defendants to the Counterclaim since, according to the Defendants, they controlHoldings and its aforesaid subsidiaries and have caused none of them to account for or disgorge the Dividend paid out by Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In the circumstances, the Defendants also counterclaim for various declaratory and other relief which may conveniently be divided,albeit at some risk of over-simplification, into five different lots. The first consists of a declaration that Holdings and/or Extramoney'scorporate shareholders hold the Dividend or part thereof amounting to HK$74,315,006 (being so much of the Dividend as is not coveredby Extramoney's Other Profits) on trust for Extramoney and declarations that Extramoney is entitled to repayment of the said sumswith compund interest and that Extramoney is entitled to trace the said sums and to all necessary accounts and enquiries.  The secondlot consists of a declaration that the Liquidators are obliged to account to Extramoney for all sums received and/or paid or usedto the extent that any such sums were trust funds held by Holdings on behalf of Extramoney and an order that Holdings and the Liqidatorsbe restrained from paying, charging or in ay other manner dealing wirth their assets save as to any excess over the said sum andinterest. The third lot consists of an order that Holdings and/or Extramoney's shareholders and the Liquidators do pay such sumsfound due on the taking of an account and a dclaration that Finance, Realty and/or Joint Venture acted in breach of trust or fiduciaryduty to Extramoney and are obliged to repay the Dividend or HK$74,315,006 to Extramoney. The fourth and final lot consists of a declarationthat upon judgment being given against them, the Defendants are subrogated t~ the rights of Extramoney as against its aforesaid shareholdersand directors, Holdings and the Liquidators.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The DEFENCES to COUNTERCLAIM</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Separate replies and defences to the Counterclaims were filed by respectively the Commissioner represented at the hearing by Mr.Robert Andrews of the Attorney General's Chambers of the one part and the corporate defendants to the Counterclaim and the Liquidatorsall of whom were represented by Mr. Griffiths of the other part.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The Commissioner's defence revolves around the issue as to which of the High Court or the Board of Review has exclusive jurisdictionto determine the issue of the correctness of Extramoney' s original assessment to tax and hence the question of reimbursement ofthe profits tax paid, the Commissioner taking the view that such matters are justiciable only by the Board of Review.  The factson which he bases such contention are that, on or around 9th January 1982, Extramoney furnished a return of profits for the tax year1980/81 disclosing assessable profits amounting to HK$132,881,885 and represented by the Defendants' unqualified report (qua auditors)attached to the audited 1980 Accounts that the same gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Extramoney at 31st December1980. Extramoney was assessed to tax on such profits and, on or about 25th March 1982, Holdings remitted the tax together with a5% surcharge for late payment. Some five years later, on or around 31st March 1987, Extramoney claimed that, of the profits tax previouslypaid, HK$17,617,556 were not properly chargeable. The Assessor refused to correct the assessment. On or around 9th March 1989, thePlaintiffs objected to such refusal but the Commissioner confirmed his previous decision. On or about 3rd January 1990, the Plaintiffsappealed to the Board of Review.  Since the latter, according to the Commissioner, has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the matterraised by such appeal, I would have no power to entertain the Defendants' Counterclaim for declaratory relief that the Plaintiffsare entitled to a refund of the Overpaid Profits Tax.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The Reply and Defence to Counterlaim of the corporate defendants and the Liquidators consists principally of a joinder of issue but,insofar as it raises any significant fresh pleas, it consists of a contention in response to the Defendantsâ argument based onwant of causation that the management of Extramoney, appreciating the effect on the financial and banking communities of a proposedqualification by prudent auditors to Extramoney's 1980 Accounts, would have withdrawn the suggestion that the Disputed Profit hadbeen made by Extramoney, wherefor no such profits would have been submitted to the Inland Revenue and the Dividend would have beencancelled.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The ISSUES</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In summary, therefore, the principal questions for my determination are:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Was the Disputed Profit made by Extramoney?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(2) If not, were the Defendants negligent or in breach of contractual or other duty in certifying Extramoney's 1980 Accounts (incorporatingthe Disputed Profit as the company's trading profits) as true and fair?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(3) If the answer to Question (2) be in the affirmative, to what (if any) extent do the other pleaded defences of estoppel, ratificaton,contributory negligence and limitation avail the Defendants?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(4) If the answer to Question (2) be in the affirmative and the other defences canvassed under (3) above be unavailing, to what (ifany) loss did such conduct on the part of the Defendants give rise?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(5) If a loss did arise from the Defendants' conduct, are the Plaintiffs precluded from recovery by failure on their part to mitigatesuch loss?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(6) Was the HK$1.2 million payment to the Defendants made by owed to trustees by Mr. Tan in breach of trust or fiduciary duty Holdingswherefor are the Defendants constructive trustees of the same for Holdings?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(7) If the answer to Question (6) were in the affirmative, are the Plaintiffs precluded from recovery by laches or limitation?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(8) If the Defendants were negligent or in breach of contractual or other duty and such conduct led to overpayment of profits taxto the Inland Revenue, do I have jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief sought by the Defendants that the Plaintiffs are entitledto repayment by the Inland Revenue of the Overpaid Profits Tax?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(9) If the Defendants were breach of contractual or other duty and such conduct led to the payment of the Dividend, are the Defendantsentitled to any relief as against Holdings, Extramoney's shareholders and directors and the Liquidators?</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Question (1) above is one of fact to be determined by the evidence, including expert evidence as to the proper attribution of profitsto a given company. Question (2) involves mixed fact and law and, so far as concerns the former aspect, I was greatly assisted bythe expert evidence called by both sides as to proper standards of accounting practice. As will become evident in the discussionwhich follows, Questions (1) and (2) are, to a certain extent, inextricably intertwined on the facts with expert opinion playinga crucial role in helping to determine both questions. Question (3) raises principally questions of law. Like Question (2) above,each of Questions (4) to (6) concern mixed fact and law. Finally, Questions (7) to (9) raise only points of law. I propose to considerseriatim each of the above questions.</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The DISPUTED PROFIT</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Question (1) sub-divides into two issues, namely, whether the Disputed Profit was ever generated as a matter of fact and, if so,whether the same was made by Extramoney as opposed by some other person or entity. Since both the above components form integralparts of the claim in negligence or breach of contractual or other duty, the onus of establishing either the non-existence of theDisputed Profit or, if it did exist, that it was not made by Extramoney lies with, the Plaintiffs:  see, for example, <i>Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed., Vol. 17, para. 14.</i>   I shall consider each such issue in turn.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>GENERATION of the DISPUTED PROFIT as a FACT</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The basic facts giving rise to the complaint are not controversial. Extramoney was a share-dealing company wholly beneficially ownedand controlled by Mr. Tan carrying on the business of buying and selling on the stockmarket publicly-quoted shares being, principally,those of Holdings' listed subsidiary CIL, all three companies (together with others) forming part of a corporate empire founded byMr. Tan in the late 1970s and known as the Carrian Group. Incorporated on 4th December 1979, Extramoney's first accounts (namely,what I have throughout this Judgment referred to as "the 1980 Accounts") covered the period 4th December 1979 to 31st December 1980("the 1980 Period"). Over that period the price of CIL shares rose from HK$5 per share in early 1980 to about HK$30 in November beforesettling, after adjusting for the effects of bonus issues, at the HK$20 level at the end of the year. Over the same period, Extramoneytraded heavily in CIL shares and disclosed in its 1980 Profit and Loss Account under "Income" profits on the sale of quoted sharesamounting (originally to some HK$314 million but which, after a provision for diminution in market value of retained shares of someHK$132 million, was reduced) to HK$182,096,691.34 ("the Gross Profits").  A considerable portion of this figure was made up of theDisputed Profit (of HK$101,688,640.10) stated in a single line journal entry in Extramoney's books to have been made by Mr. Tan onbehalf of Extramoney from the sale of an unspecified number of CIL shares.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Collapse of Carrian and the CCB Raids</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Suspicions were aroused when, after the collapse of the Carrian Group including its publicly-listed arm CIL in or around October1983 and the subsequent winding-up of Holdings (the details of which are not relevant to this case wherefor I do not propose to burdenthis Judgment with any reference to the same), an investigation was implemented into the causes of such collapse which included inspecting,among other material, the books of the various Holdings' subsidiaries (including Extramoney) and their auditors' audit files seizedby the Commercial Crimes Bureau ("the CCB") from respectively the companies' and the auditors' premises in the last quarter of 1983.In the course of such inspection, it was discovered that whereas Extramoney's profits other than the Disputed Profit ("the OtherProfits") appeared to be well-documented, traceable and explicable, there was an apparent absence of independent supporting documentation(whether in Extramoneyâs books and records or the Defendants' audit working papers) verifying the underlying transactions saidto give rise to the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> It may conveniently be mentioned here that, while all parties and their witnesses made repeated references during the course of thetrial to the Disputed Profit and the other Profits being respectively "the HK$101 million profit" and "the HK$81 million profit",the use; of such shorthand references is not merely inaccurate but is actually misleading and would tend unfairly to inflate anddistort the significance of the Disputed  Profit to the Gross Profits since the figure of HK$101 million has not been adjusted bythe aforesaid provision for diminution in value of retained shares whereas HK$81 million figure is arrived at by simplistically deductingthe former unadjusted figure from the pre-adjusted Gross Profits of HK$182 million.  I intend, therefore, to adhere in this Judgmentto the expressions 'Disputed Profit' and âOther Profitsâ.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I have used earlier the adjective 'apparent' to characterise the aforesaid absence of independent supporting documentation verifyingthe Disputed Profit since the exact contents of the Defendants' audit file was a matter of considerable controversy at the hearing.The Defendants contend that they had always - had included among their audit working papers pertaining to the audit of Extramoney's1980 Accounts two additional documents verifying the generation of the Disputed Profit ("the Additional Materialâ), but the samewould appear to be missing from the materials which has come into the Plaintiffs' solicitorsâ possession for the institution andconduct of these proceedings some years after the original CCB raid and seizure executed on the Defendantsâ office premises in1983. The Plaintiffs hotly deny the allegation of inclusion within the Defendantsâ original audit working papers of the AdditionalMaterial.  This is an important issue which I shall resolve in a later part of this Judgment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In the meantime, I find from tolerably clear evidence that, apart from the, Additional Material and certain internally generatedentries (which I will detail shortly), there is no verifying material supporting the making of the Disputed Profit among the variousdocuments purporting to Extramoney's books and records for the 1980 Period and the Defendantsâ audit pertaining to the same inthe possession of the Plaintiffs' solicitors.  For the Plaintiffs, it is this singular want of documentary verification which castsdoubt on the very existence of the Disputed Profit.  So as to determine whether such suspicions were justified, it is necessary torecapitulate in brief what the Plaintiffs' solicitors possess by way of seized documentary material.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>The Material Seized</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> So far as concerned Extramoney, this consisted of the company's general ledger, its cash book and supporting vouchers as well asthe Defendants' audit working papers relating thereto which were seized separately by the CCB in the second of two raids on the Defendants'office premises carried out on respectively 8th and 13th December 1983. The general ledger is divided into folios containing thecompany's various accounts including its assets, liabilities and profit and loss accounts. The cash book lists and details cash receiptsand cash payments. The supporting vouchers consist, in the case of Extramoney, of receipt vouchers, payment vouchers. And journal(or transfer) vouchers. As I understand the expert evidence adduced by the parties, it is uncontroversial that audit working papersare compiled by auditors to serve primarily as evidence of work done and would include key schedules analysing major transactionsand major balances and records of the verification work performed on such key items or balances as well as conclusions reached bythe auditors.  An auditor's process of verification may be undertaken by tracing or following a transaction either from a sourcedocument or voucher all the way through to the relevant entry in the general ledger or vice versa.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>The Audit Trail</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The material seized revealed that Extramoney's Other Profits (namely, its Gross Profits aside from the Disputed Profit) are clearlytraceable from a series of documents or documentary entries in Extramoney's books and records and the Defendants' audit working paperswhich together constitute what is known within the accounting profession as an 'audit trail'. By way of example, all purchases ofquoted shares can be traced, first of all, to an entry in Extramoney's cash book setting out the date of acquisition, the name ofthe stockbroking firm involved, the name of the stock concerned, the quoted unit price, the amount acquired, the total purchase priceincluding brokerage and stamp duty, the number of the cheque drawn to pay the purchase price and the voucher number.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Next stop on the audit trail is an Extramoney Pay Order (signed by the officer of the company preparing the same and countersignedby another officer signifying his approval of such payment) with a serial number which tallies with the voucher number entered inthe cash book, a date, the name of the stockbroking firm to be paid and such other particulars as the name of the stock concerned,the quoted unit price, the amount to be acquired, the total purchase price including brokerage and stamp duty, the cheque used topay the purchase price, all of which would match the particulars set out in Extramoney's corresponding cash book entry to which Ihave already made reference. </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Thereafter one sees on the audit trail a bought note of the particular brokerage firm involved setting out Extramoney's name as thepurchaser, a date, the number of shares purchased, the name of the stock concerned, the quoted unit price, the purchase price, theamounts of brokerage and stamp duty payable and the total price, all of which again matches the particulars entered in Extramoney'saforesaid cash book.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The fourth stop on the audit trail is an entry in a folio (entitled 'Investment in Mai Hon' if the acquisition should relate to CILshares, Mai Hon Investments Limited being the former name of CIL) inserted in Extramoney' s general ledger particularising the purchasewith a date, the name of the stock concerned, the number acquired, the total purchase price and the corresponding cash book pagereference where the matching entry is to be found.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The final stop on the audit trail is an entry in a schedule of share transactions (entitled, in the case of CIL transactions, 'Scheduleof Mai Hon Share Transactions') prepared by the Defendants in the course of their audit of Extramoney's Accounts filed in their auditfile setting out the number of shares purchased, the purchase consideration and the transaction date which again matches the particularsappearing in Extramoney's books.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> A similar five-stop audit trail exists for sales (as opposed to purchases) of shares by Extramoney starting with a cash book entrysetting out particulars of the transaction including the date, the folio reference, the name of the stock concerned, the number soldand the total sale price. This can next be traced to a depositor's receipt issued by Extramoney's bankers evidencing the paymentinto Extramoney's account of the sale proceeds. Next stop on the audit trail is the contract or sold note or notes issued by therelevant stockbrokers evidencing the sale of the stock in question. Thereafter the transaction can be traced to an entry or entriesin a folio (entitled, where the transaction concerned CIL shares, "Proceeds on Sale of Mai Hon Shares") included in Extramoney'sgeneral ledger. Finally, the transaction particulars will appear in the 'Schedule of Mai Hon Share Transactions' prepared by theDefendants' audit staff and included in the audit file.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> It can be appreciated from the foregoing material that the available documentation supporting or verifying the generation of theOther Profits is both comprehensive and of an observably high quality. Even Mr. Meocre Li, the Plaintiff's expert witness being acertified public accountant of some 15 years' standing with considerable experience in auditing and accounting standards and a memberof the Accounting Standards Committee of the Hong Kong society of Accountants, conceded as much. Is there equivalent documentationverifying the Disputed Profit?  Is there an audit trail at all and, if so, is it possessed of equal or sufficient clarity?</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> By way of a starting point, one finds among the books and records of Extramoney for the 1980 Period an entry in an undated transfervoucher debiting Mr. Tan with the amount of the Disputed Profit giving a folio reference 'L609/1' and simultaneously crediting Extramoneywith the same amount designated 'Profit on share dealing' giving another folio reference 'PlOl/1'. Turning to the first-mentionedfolio 'L609/1' which is a page from Extramoney's current account with Mr. Tan filed in Extramoney's 1980 general ledger, one findsa single entry dated 31st December 1980 debiting Mr. Tan with the whole amount of the Disputed Profit stating 'Profit on sale ofCIL to George Tan'. One then finds in the other folio 'P101/1' which is a schedule entitled 'Profit &amp; Loss on Sale of Investments'also included in Extramoneyâs general ledger an entry dated 31st December 1980 which reads 'Profit on sale of CIL' and creditingExtramoney with the amount of the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Subject only to the question of the inclusion of the Additional Material, the above constitutes all the available documentation onthe Disputed Profit found among 'Extramoneyâs books and records. A number of features are striking. First, it is unclear how manytransactions gave rise to the Disputed Profit. If it be a single transaction, then it purports to have occurred on the very lastday of the relevant year generating a very significant portion of the Extramoney's trading profits for that year. If it be more thanone transaction, then they are collectively recorded by way of a lump sum entry at the year-end with no breakdown in terms of datesor figures. Further, the year-end date does not inspire a reader with confidence that the transaction necessarily occurred on thatparticular day but suggests rather that the transaction was given such a date so as to qualify for inclusion in that year's accounts.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Secondly and more significantly, all the documentation available from Extramoney's books and records (again subject only to the questionof the inclusion of the Additional Material) referring to the Disputed Profit consists of the company's internally generated entries.There is available no underlying or third party documentation such as contract or sale notes with which one could independently verifythe occurrence of the transaction or transactions supposedly generating the Disputed Profit. Therein lies an important qualitativedifference between the documentation supporting the other Profits and that referrable to the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Thirdly, the journal entry recording the making of the Disputed Profit is contradicted by Extramoney's inventory of its holdingsof CIL shares over the 1980 Period and also by the absence of any corresponding records in Extramoney' s cashbook and general ledgerwherein Extramoney's shareholdings and details of its monthly purchases of CIL shares were recorded. Moreover, there was no recordto indicate that Extramoney ever held a sufficient number of CIL shares so as to generate the Disputed Profit. Folio 'A302' in Extramoney'sgeneral ledger setting out the 'Cost of Mai Hon Shares Sold' reveals no record of Extramoney having acquired 14,133,920 CIL shareswhich were then sold so as to generate the Disputed Profit. Folio 'A301': entitled 'Investment in Mai Hon' is likewise silent onthe acquisition of the requisite number of CIL shares.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Fourthly, the books of Extramoney contain no corresponding entries for the gross proceeds from such alleged sale. Folio 'A 703 'entitled 'Proceeds on Sale of Mai Hon (Investment) Shares' in the general ledger gives no figure for the proceeds of sale of the14,133,920 CIL shares. Fifthly, there is no record of the prices of the purchase or the sale of the CIL shares giving rise to theDisputed Profit. All the above contrasts sharply with the quality and sufficiency of the documentation available to support the generationof the Other Profits.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Sixthly, there is available no agency agreement made between Mr. Tan and Extramoney or other record of Mr. Tan acting as Extramoney'sagent.  Finally, it is clear that there have been no similar previous dealings by Mr. Tan on behalf of Extramoney over the entiretyof the 1980 Period.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> That there may exist a reasonable doubt as to the existence and authenticity of the Disputed Profit from a perusal of Extramoney'sbooks and records is confirmed by Schedule 'R1' prepared by the Defendants in the course of their audit of Extramoney's accountsand included in their audit file entitled 'Profit on Share Dealing' which sets out a table consisting of four columns headed respectively'Month', 'Sale Proceeds', 'Cost of Sale' and 'Profit (Loss)â and which summarises Extramoney's profits derived from share dealinggiving a monthly breakdown. It is noteworthy that the Disputed Profit which, as I have earlier mentioned, constitutes a very significantportion of Extramoney's Gross Profits for the year is assigned not to any particular month but rather is appended to the table afterthe December entry thereby raising a question as to the precise date or dates when such profit was made. Further and, not surprisingly,the member of the Defendants' audit team who looked into the matter and prepared Schedule 'R1' was apparently unable to give anyfigures under either the 'Sale Proceeds' or the 'Cost of Sale' columns corresponding to the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In summary, I find the Plaintiffs' suspicions of the authenticity of the Disputed Profit to be perfectly justified. This does not,however, adequately dispose of the first issue under Question (1) as to whether or not the Disputed Profit was generated as a matterof fact, since the Additional Material said to form part of the Defendants' original audit working papers and adduced in evidenceby the Defendants at the hearing before me is far from silent in terms of reference to the Disputed Profit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Additional Material</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> According to the Plaintiffs, none of the Additional Material were found among Extramoney's original accounting records or the Defendants'original audit file seized by the CCB in 1983 but emerged for the first time on or shortly before discovery by the Defendants in1989. The Defendants hotly contest this allegation and maintain that both items had always been enclosed within the covers of theiroriginal audit file. This controversy assumed mammoth proportions during the hearing but, as I shall later demonstrate, there waseventually less to this point than met the eye at least in relation to answering Question (1) though perhaps not so in relation toQuestion (2). Before resolving this issue, I intend first to describe the Additional Material.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The first additional document relied on by the Defendants at the trial appears to be a record of market purchases and subsequentbonus issues of CIL shares which, when later sold (although such sales are not shown on the document itself), supposedly generatedthe Disputed Profit. It is a third party document being an eight-page statement issued by a stock brokerage firm known as OkasanInternational (Asia) Limited (âOkasanâ) showing acquisitions of 9,208,000 CIL shares between 18th July and 13th August 1980 underan account opened in the name of, not Extramoney, but rather its shareholder and director Finance ("the Okasan Statementâ). Itpurports to present at most one half the evidential picture to support the existence of the Disputed Profit. According to Mr. ColinPassmore, a partner of the Plaintiffsâ solicitors then in charge of this piece of litigation, his clients saw a copy of the OkasanStatement for the first time in or about March 1989 during pre-discovery disclosure by the Defendants.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The second additional document appears to be a summary of sales of CIL shares giving rise to the Disputed Profit and (notwithstandingobvious shortcomings therein to which I shall revert in detail) purports thus to complete the evidential picture. It is a photocopyof a handwritten schedule (âthe Profit Schedule") found in a file of papers described as belonging to Extramoney and prepared,according to Mr. Thomas Lai ("Mr. Lai") of the Defendants being the partner in charge of the auditing of Extramoney's 1980 Accountsand the submission of its tax returns for the year, by his audit assistant one Lee Chun-ip ("Mr. Lee"). It purports to give a breakdownof the Disputed Profit by reference to disposals therein listed of nine individual lots totalling 14,133,920 CIL shares (arrivedat by the aforesaid acquisition of 9,208,000 such shares as shown on the Okasan Statement together with accretions thereto from twosuccessive bonus issues) and particularised under eight columns headed respectively 'No. of shares in hands [sic]', 'Average unitcost HK$', 'Total cost HK$', 'No. of shares disposed', 'Buyers' , 'unit cost HK$', 'Consideration HK$' and finally 'Profit &amp;Loss on Disposal'. The last-mentioned column is divided into two sub-columns entitled respectively 'The Co. HK$' and 'Travel DivisionHK$'. Of the nine listed transactions, eight generated profits amounting to some HK$86 million entered under 'The Co.' sub-columnwhilst the remaining transaction was entered under the 'Travel Division' sub-column. According to Mr. Passmore, the Plaintiffs sawthis document for the first time on 28th September 1989 when it was shown to them by the Defendants shortly after the parties' mutualdiscovery.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Authenticity of the Additional Material</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The Plaintiffs suggest or imply that the Profit Schedule is not a contemporaneous document but, rather, a self-serving one devisedby the Defendants after the event to justify their original want of vigilance in detecting the problems underlying the proper inclusionof the Disputed Profit in Extramoney's 1980 Profits and Loss Account. The Defendants maintain, on the other hand, that both the OkasanStatement showing purchases and the Profit Schedule showing sales had always formed part of their audit working papers. They seekto explain their apparent absence from the seized documents produced by the Plaintiffs at the trial by reference to poor safekeepingby either the CCB after their seizure of the originals in the last quarter of 1983, or by the Independent Commission Against Corruption(âthe ICAC") to whom all such materials were turned over for safekeeping after the completion of CCB's investigations in 1987 forthe purposes of commencing criminal proceedings against Mr. Tan, or by the Liquidators or by their firm Messrs. Ernst and Young towhom some originals such as bank statements and some ledgers were, together with photocopies of the other documents, turned overfor the purpose of preparation for commencement of civil suits or, in the final alternative, by the Plaintiffs' solicitors who lasthandled the original documents in the spring of 1992 for the purpose of conducting certain interlocutory proceedings in this action.The Defendants' contentions of poor safekeeping of the seized material gained considerable force when it emerged that the original(as opposed to photocopies) of the Defendants' audit file was, indeed, lost shortly after the interlocutory hearings in early 1992either when the same were still with the Plaintiffs' solicitors or after they had been returned to the ICAC (the former being theICAC's version and the latter being the Plaintiffs' solicitors' position) and has not since been recovered with the result that thesame could not produced at the trial before me. There followed certain predictable recriminations within the plaintiffs' camp whichit is unnecessary for me either to go into or in any way attribute blame save to state the obvious which is that the Defendants are,of course, in no way responsible for such loss.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I shall first review the evidence before stating my findings on the above issue as to whether the Profit Schedule ever formed partof the Defendants' original audit file. The following are the salient features of evidence supporting the Plaintiff's contention. First of all, Mr. Meocre Li, testified to specifically searching for supportings of the Disputed Profit among the original booksand records of Extramoney and the Defendants' original audit file when he commenced investigations in December 1983 or early 1984on or shortly after the second CCB raid carried out on the Defendants' premises but failed to find any such material. According tohim, he came across neither the Profit Schedule nor the Okasan Statement. Secondly, a photocopy of the Defendants' original auditfile was fortunately made by Mr. Meocre Li's staff on his instructions in late 1983 or early 1984 shortly after the seizure for useas a working copy and the original immediately thereafter returned to the CCB. The photocopy has, in the meantime, been preservedand was produced by the Plaintiffs as Exhibit âP1â at the hearing. Neither the Profit Schedule nor the Okasan Statement can befound in that exhibit. Thirdly, Superintendent Rodney starling of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force testified to, inter alia, thegeneral system employed by the CCB in safekeeping seized Carrian documents but, whilst I am grateful to him for coming forward toassist me in resolving an issue in this dispute, I confess to finding this part of his testimony not of particular assistance sincethe Superintendent was neither personally involved in the Carrian raids nor responsible for the safekeeping of documents seized noreven attached to the CCB at the material time wherefor there are clear limits to the amount of assistance I can derive from his evidence.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> As against such evidence, Mr. Lai of the Defendants testified that during the raid executed by the CCB at the Defendants' officesin December 1983, the CCB released, upon the Defendants' request, the original audit file to the Defendants for photocopying priorto leaving the Defendants' office with the original afterwards. According to Mr. Lai, the original audit file had enclosed withinthe covers thereof but not filed or attached therein loose copies of the Profit Schedule and the Okasan Statement. Mr. Lai furthersaid that, when the original audit file was surrendered to the CCB after photocopying had been complete, it was handed over in likefashion with the loose documents enclosed between the covers. During the course of the trial, the Defendants adduced the photocopyin evidence as Exhibit 'D11'. This exhibit consists of a file of the Defendants' audit working papers pertaining to Extramoney's1980 Accounts together with loose copies enclosed within the covers of the same file of the Profit Schedule and the Okasan Statement.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> There arose, however, considerable controversy between the parties as to whether Mr. Lai was honest when he testified to having photocopiedthe original audit file in 1983 when Mr. Colin Passmore of the Plaintiffs' solicitors records him in a contemporaneous note takenat a meeting between them held in 1989 as saying to the former that he only made the photocopy in 1986 or 1987 after he first learntthat the writ herein had been issued, at a time when the originals were no longer in the Defendants' possession, the same havingbeen seized by the CCB as long ago as 1983. Mr. Lai hotly denies making any such statement and challenges, by extension, the accuracyof Mr. Passmore's note.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Having seen and heard respectively Mr. Meocre Li, Mr. Passmore and Mr. Lai testify on this factual aspect of the case, I am persuadedon a balance of probabilities, first and foremost, that while neither the Profit Schedule nor the Okasan Statement formed an integralpart of the Defendantsâ original audit file in the sense of being physically attached thereto or filed therein, they were neverthelessenclosed within the covers of such file as loose documents; secondly, that Mr. Lai did undertake the photocopying of the originalaudit file together with the loose enclosures in 1983 at the time of the CCB raid prior to handing over the original file with looseenclosures to the CCB; thirdly, that Mr. Passmore attempted to and did successfully make an accurate contemporaneous note of whatMr. Lai said in 1989; and, finally, that Mr. Lai's oral reference at the 1989 meeting to a date later than that on which he actuallymade the photocopying is attributable to nothing more sinister than an unfortunate slip of Mr. Lai's recollection during the courseof what Mr. Passmore loosely described in his evidence (although not in those precise terms) as a somewhat tense confrontation betweenthe Defendants' audit partner and his accuser's solicitors.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> I am reinforced in the above conclusions by Superintendent Starling's evidence in cross-examination that, as a matter of standardCCB practice, relevant commercial documents are not necessarily seized or handed over on the exact same day of any given raid but,for reasons of administrative convenience, may sometimes be surrendered a few days later and sometimes in several instalments.  Theabove conclusions are further reinforced by the Defendants I disclosure on discovery of the Profit Schedule under Schedule 2 of theirList of Documents filed on 3rd July 1989 as having been "last in the Defendantsâ possession, custody or power in December 1983when they were handed to the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> A necessary corollary to my foregoing findings is that the loose copies of the Profit Schedule and the Okasan Statement enclosedwithin the covers of the original audit file handed over to the CCB were lost sometime after the date of seizure in 1983 and wellbefore this trial. The likelihood on a balance of probabilities is that they were lost either shortly after the original audit filewas handed over to the CCB in December 1983 following the completion of photocopying by the Defendants or at or around the time Mr.Meocre Li's staff photocopied the various seized files and papers to make working copies for investigation, since I believe Mr. MeocreLi to be telling me the truth when he testified to being unable to find supportings for the Disputed Profit, let alone the ProfitSchedule and the Okasan Statement, when he first began going through the Extramoney papers for the 1980 Period. I certainly haveno doubt that the Additional Material were lost before the seized documents (or what remained of them) were handed over to the Plaintiffsâsolicitors for commencement of the present action since I believe the Plaintiffs' solicitors to have been genuinely surprised tocome across for the first time copies of the two items when the same were disclosed by the Defendants' solicitors on or shortly beforediscovery in 1989.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> That there may have been some papers lost amongst the six million odd documents (including some 80 odd files from the Defendants)seized by the CCB is not at all surprising. Indeed, such is the sheer volume of paper involved that the converse would have beenastonishing.  Secondly, that loose documents may have been lost in the course of or shortly after their seizure and removal to theoffices of the CCB prior to inspection by Mr. Meocre Li and his 20-strong investigative team from Messrs. Arthur Anderson or alternativelyin the course of or after photocopying by the latter is a fortiori not surprising.  Thirdly, Mr. Li himself admits that he did notcheck bundles for completeness after photocopying by his staff to make working copies. Fourthly, Mr. Li moreover conceded with refreshingcandour, more than once in the course of cross-examination, that a certain number of the seized documents have been mislaid or lostor gone missing from time to time.  Fifthly, Mr. Li testified that he saw more contract notes supporting the transactions recordedin Extramoney over the 1980 Period shortly after he commenced investigations in late 1983 or early 1984 than were available at thehearing before me thereby reinforcing the notion that some relevant papers may have been lost.  Sixthly, Mr. Colin Passmore confirmson affidavit that the Defendants have consistently complained throughout the litigation of inadequate discovery by the Plaintiffs. While this in no way establishes the validity of the complaint, it does undermine any suggestion that the complaint may have beena recent invention. Seventhly, Miss Chua Si-hua, an in-house legal adviser to Messrs. Ernst and Young, said on affidavit that itwas only in the late summer of 1991 that Extramoney's journal vouchers for the 1980 Period were discovered in a file under the nameof a totally different company and confirmed in cross-examination that documents were not always filed in the place one would expect.She further said that the 1980 transfer vouchers which she would expect to be with the ICAC were not there and confirmed on affidavitin August 1992 that the originals of Holdings' 1980 and 1981 journal vouchers have been lost but the latter surfaced shortly beforethe trial. Finally, the loss of the original audit file in or around the spring of 1992 shortly after the completion of certain interlocutoryhearings in this action generates no confidence in the assumption that either the CCB or the ICAC or the Plaintiffs' solicitors'methods of safekeeping were necessarily foolproof.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Additional Material: The Profit Schedule</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Having found as a fact the inclusion by way of loose enclosures of the Profit Schedule and the Okasan Statement within the coversof the Defendants' original audit file, I turn now to examine the significance or evidential value of each of the two documents inestablishing the existence of the Disputed Profit. Considering first of all the Profit Schedule, a number of features of the documentare noteworthy. First of all, none of the transactions therein listed are dated. Indeed, no date appears on the document at all.Secondly, no seller or sellers are identified in relation to any of the transactions.  Thirdly, there appears on the face of thedocument to be no 'tick marks', being a form of shorthand or code widely used by auditors for confirming or checking entries or calculationsin their audit working papers, the presence of which on any given document in an audit file would indicate that verification workhad been performed on such entries or calculations. Mr. Lai, the partner of the Defendants in charge of the audit of Extramoney,concedes in cross-examination that tick marks should have been made by all his staff so that seniors and supervising partners likehimself could refer to them.  In stark contrast to the schedules found in the Defendants' audit file all of which are to a greateror lesser extent covered with tick marks, the absence of such tell-tale signs from the Profit Schedule supports the Plaintiffs' contentionthat such document formed no part of the Defendants' original audit working papers. Fourthly, there is no cross-referencing betweeneither the Profit Schedule (or, indeed, the Okasan Statement) or the entries therein to the audit working papers or vice versa. Again,the absence of such cross-referencing reinforces the Plaintiffs' above contention.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Fifthly, the fact that all the figures listed by way of sales consideration in the Profit Schedule are (save only for the first transaction)round figures appears to indicate either that the Disputed Profit was generated without the payment of either brokerage or stampduty, or alternatively that the computation of the Disputed Profit was undertaken without reference to any such payments.  For reasonscanvassed below, the latter conclusion would appear to be correct.  First of all, it cannot be gainsaid that whilst brokerage wouldnot be levied for private trades where no broker was engaged, apart from the very first disposal listed in the Profit Schedule whichis clearly depicted as a market transaction since the very word "Market" is inserted to identify the purchaser under the 'Buyers'column, five out of the other eight listed transactions give as the name of the purchaser under the 'Buyers' column the notationâC &amp; Mâ, being (according to Mr. Meocre Li's evidence which I accept) the initials of a well-known brokerage firm known asC &amp; M Securities Co. frequently used by members of the Carrian Group. Additionally, whilst brokerage may be avoided for non-marketdealings, stamp duty is payable in any event.  Thirdly, for each of the fourth to seventh disposals, the performance of a simplearithmetical exercise of multiplying the unit cost with the number of shares sold would yield the exact consideration figure shownon the Profit Schedule. Balanced as against the above observations, which may be regarded on one interpretation as casting doubton the authenticity of the figures set out in the Profit Schedule, the total number of shares disposed of under the nine listed transactionsbeing 14,133,920 matches exactly the number mentioned in the Okasan Statement as having been acquired which, when later sold, generatedthe Disputed Profit. For the above reasons and as well as others canvassed below, the foregoing observations support the alternativeconclusion that the Disputed Profit was computed in the main without reference to either brokerage or stamp duty.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> All of the above are valid criticisms of the relative value and demonstrate the inherent limitations of the Profit Schedule in establishingthe authenticity of the Disputed Profit. It is also plain that, irrespective of my finding on the issue of the document's authenticityor whether it formed part of the Defendants' original audit file, the Profit Schedule constitutes, in the words of Mr. Meocre Liwhich I accept, merely the starting point for verification rather than the end product being actual verification of the DisputedProfit itself.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Additional Material: The Okasan Statement</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The same observation cannot, however, cannot be made of the Okasan Statement which is treated by consent as being an authentic, contemporaneousthird party document made by a known firm of stockbrokers. The following observations are pertinent. The Okasan Statement establishesbeyond a peradventure market purchases of 9,208,000 CIL shares from 18th July to 13th August 1980. The initial accumulation of 9,208,000CIL shares referred to in the Profit Schedule matches precisely the acquisition of the identical number of shares between the aforesaiddates shown the Okasan Statement. Secondly, the two issues of bonus shares referred to in the Profit Schedule which boosted the cumulativeholding (less periodic disposals) to 14,133,920 CIL shares can be demonstrated to have actually taken place by reference to the OkasanStatement. Indeed, Mr. Meocre Li conceded in cross-examination that whoever produced the Profit Schedule must have had the OkasanStatement in front of him.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Other Documentarv Evidence</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Further documentary evidence adduced by the Defendants at the trial (although clearly forming no part of either Extramoney's 1980books and records or the Defendantsâ audit working papers) advanced the cause of verification of the Disputed Profit. The eighthlisted transaction in the Profit Schedule depicting the sale of one million CIL shares for HK$15.4 million to certain buyers designated"Alex Fung &amp; Lawrence" (who, as the evidence shows, were at the material time both Carrian employees) is independently confirmedby the late discovery just before the adjourned hearing this year and subsequent production as Exhibits 'D5' and 'D7' of respectivelya copy of Mr. Fung's cheque drawn on the Hang Seng Bank dated 30th October 1980 and payable in the amount of HK$7.7 million beingexactly half the aforesaid listed sale price and, secondly, a bank statement issued by the Hang Seng Bank in respect of Mr. Fung'saccount for the months of October and November 1980 confirming that such an amount had, indeed, been withdrawn therefrom.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In the circumstances, I find on the totality of the evidence the transactions listed in the Profit Schedule to be genuine and I furtherfind, on a preponderance of probabilities, the Disputed Profit to have been generated as a matter of fact. The above finding disposes,accordingly, of the first issue, leaving extant the remaining one under Question (1) as to whether the Disputed Profit was made byExtramoney as opposed to some other person or entity.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>ATTRIBUTION of the DISPUTED PROFIT to EXTRAMONEY</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> The documentary evidence is overwhelming in suggesting a negative answer to this outstanding issue. First of all, the account depictedby the Okasan Statement as having generated the Disputed Profit was, as I have mentioned more than once, opened and maintained notin the name of either Extramoney or even Mr. Tan (being, supposedly, Extramoney's agent) but rather that of Finance. The Defendantsattempt to explain this away by reference to, first of all, Extramoney's consistent practice of acquiring CIL shares through nomineesas shown in the documents and, secondly, Mr. Tan's supposed policy decision in early 1980 to put all dealings in CIL shares carriedout on behalf of the Carrian Group into Extramoney. I say 'supposed' policy decision because Mr. Tan never came forward to testifyat the trial. I shall revert to the ramifications of this point later. Thirdly, the Defendants say that the signing of Extramoney's1980 Accounts by Finance qua director of Extramoney is representation to them qua auditors that the Disputed Profit, although generatedin Finance's name as shown in the Okasan Statement, was in fact made by Extramoney. This last point made by the Defendants is, however,less than persuasive since I consider as a matter of law (see, for example, <u>London Oil Storaqe</u> <u>Ltd. v. Seear, Hasluck and Co.</u> (1904) 31 Accts. L.R. 1, discussed later in this Judgment) that the signing of accounts by a director, while importing a representationby him as to the truth of the contents thereof, in no way relieves the auditors of their duty to verify the accounts.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In any event, the Defendants' proffered explanations as outlined above are, however, contradicted by all the documentary materialI have earlier canvassed in relation to the inadequacy of Extramoney's book entries supporting the making of the Disputed Profit(whether ipso facto or by Extramoney) in stark contrast to that which verified the generation of the Other Profits including, inparticular, the total absence in Extramoneyâs cash book evidencing the movement of funds to purchase the requisite number of CILshares over the summer months referred to in the Okasan Statement so as to generate the Disputed Profit. As is evident from my canvassingof the documentary material in considering the first issue under Question (1), none of the purchases of CIL shares, the paymentsor liability to the brokers Okasan, as shown in the Okasan Statement, were recorded in the books and records of Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Secondly, the absence of any reference in the books and records of Extramoney to the dividend paid out on the CIL shares acquired(before subsequent resale so as to generate the Disputed Profit) reinforces the view that such shares were not purchased and suchprofit not made by Extramoney.  As the hearing progressed, it became common ground that dividends amounting of approximately HK$lmillion paid out on some 5,208,000 CIL shares which had at the material time not yet been resold had been retained by Mr. Tan byway of commission or reward for the generation of the profit on behalf of Extramoney.  The Directors' Report nevertheless statedthat "no emoluments were paid or accrued to the directors". The Defendants sought to argue that since Mr. Tan was not stricto sensua director of the company the same need not be disclosed in Extramoney's accounts as director's emoluments.  When it was subsequentlypointed out that <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 1</a></i> <i>of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> defined a director as including "any person occupying the position of director by whatever name called" and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s161.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 161</a> (2) of the same Ordinance dealing with particulars in accounts of directors' emoluments, pensions etc. provided that "the amountshown [in the accounts] shall include any emolument paid to or receivable by any person in respect of his services as a directorof a company", the Defendants changed their stance and Mr. Lai of the Defendants conceded in his evidence that, with the benefitof hindsight, the dividends should have been disclosed in the accounts and the value thereof paid to Mr. Tan by way of director'semoluments but, unfortunately, the above course had not been followed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Mr. Lai further testified that he attempted to persuade Mr. Tan to debit his current account maintained with Extramoney with theamount of the dividend amounting to about HK$l million which he had retained but the latter refused on the ground that the figurewas insignificant compared with the amount of the Disputed Profit generated by him for Extramoney and that it was equivalent to acommission. Additionally, Mr. Lai testified that Mr. Tan had directly instructed Okasan to issue to his favour a cheque in the amountof the dividend which cheque he later paid into his own personal account. While I do not doubt the veracity of Mr. Lai's testimonyin this regard, I have to confess that, in my judgment, the above account in no way strengthens the Defendant's contention that theDisputed Profit was made by Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> As against that last observation, the Defendants point out, first of all, that all the pre-18th September transactions shown on theOkasan Statement as having been carried out in the name of the account-holder Finance are nowhere to be found in Finance's books(the same being also audited by the Defendants) and, secondly, that Mr. Tan's supposed policy of putting all acquisitions of CILshares within the Carrian Group into Extramoney supports the supposition that the Disputed Profit must have been made by Extramoney.Ignoring for the time being the absence of direct evidence to support the notion of there having been any decision made by Mr. Tanto effect the aforesaid policy and assuming that the same can be inferred by reference to documentary material covering Extramoney'sdealings in CIL shares, the Defendants' theory nevertheless begs the question whether the specific acquisitions of CIL shares shownon the Okasan Statement were in fact made for the Carrian Group as opposed to for Mr. Tan himself or one or other of his privatecompanies.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> Thirdly, the Okasan Statement is itself divided into two parts with 17th September 1980 as the cut-off date as indicated by a manuscriptscribble followed by two lines across the middle of page 6 of the Statements which Mr. Lai of the Defendants has identified as respectivelyhis initials and hand-drawn dividing lines indicating that the entries below the said lines record transactions executed in the nameof Finance but in reality on behalf of a private company belonging to Mr. Tan but forming no part of the Carrian Group known as PerakPioneer Limited ("Perak Pioneer"). The fact that the transactions starting on 18th September 1980 as shown in the remainder of theOkasan Statement can be traced to entries in the books of Perak pioneer as contrasted with the absence of similar book entries forExtramoney cannot but support the notion that the pre-18th September transactions were not executed on the part of Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> Fourthly, the contents of Profit Schedule itself support the notion that the transactions therein listed and carried out so as togenerate the Disputed Profit were not done on behalf of Extramoney. To begin with, none of the nine individual sales listed in theProfit Schedule save for the third one can be found among Extramoney's 1980 books and records. The third listed transaction recordsa sale of 4,448,000 CIL shares (to a person or entity who can no longer be identified since the name originally appearing on theProfit Schedule has since been obliterated with the name of Mr. Tan substituted instead) at a price of HK$42,700,800 thereby generatinga profit of HK$18,690,461.52. This transaction appears to correspond (by reason of a remarkable coincidence of figures) to an entryin Extramoney's cashbook dated 22nd August 1980 recording the purchase by Extramoney of an identical number of CIL shares for theexact same sum of HK$42,700,800. Thus it would appear that, if the transactions listed in the Profit Schedule were indeed made onbehalf of Extramoney as contended for by the Defendants, then, by the third listed sale, Extramoney took the inexplicable step ofselling to itself 4,448,000 CIL shares it had earlier acquired and, in the process, absurdly recorded a profit of HK$18,690,461.52when, if the Defendants' contention be right, there should be no profit recorded at all.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> The Defendants seek to overcome this conundrum by suggesting that Mr. Tan having, qua agent of Extramoney, sold certain shares tohimself at a profit and then immediately thereafter on-selling to Extramoney at the same price, he would necessarily have to accountto Extramoney for the said profit. However, the above proposition needs only to be stated for its absurdity to be demonstrated sinceExtramoney ended up by retaining the same lot of shares and there was never any sale to the market or a third party which would havegenerated a real profit. Put another way, if the purchaser of the shares were Extramoney, then the seller is more likely than notto be a person or entity other than Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Fifthly and most significantly, additional reference to the Disputed Profit found in four pages of apparently contemporaneous documentationdated variously 5th to 7th May 1981 found in a file containing Carrian internal memoranda entitled "John Wong Inter-office Memo"and adduced by the Plaintiffs at the trial as Exhibit 'P2' reinforce the notion that the Disputed Profit was not made by Extramoney.The provenance and authorship of much of Exhibit 'P2' has always been controversial and the same remains, to a significant extent,unknown and unestablished even at the end of the trial. However, as I shall explain below, such ignorance on my part is a matterof little moment to a proper determination of the second issue under Question (1).</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Exhibit 'P2' incorporatinq the 'Dear Georqe' Letters</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> The first page of Exhibit âP2â consists of a note handwritten in blue ink addressed to one John Wong (who was, as the evidenceshows and which I accept, the financial controller of the Carrian Group) marked "For your information" and signed by one Anita Law(Miss Law being, as the evidence shows which again I accept, Mr. Tan's personal assistant) with a notation beneath the signaturewhich reads "7/5" which the parties accept as a reference to 7th May and, although the year was unspecified, the likelihood on thebalance of probabilities is that the date of Miss Law's note is 7th May 1981.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> The remaining three pages are typewritten with handwritten notations appended thereto. The first such typewritten page (being thesecond page of Exhibit 'P2') has at the top an inscription handwritten in red ink which reads "Chan &amp; Lai Mr. Lai what do youthink?" followed by a signature which Mr. Meocre Li as well as Mr. Lam Hon-ming ("Mr. Lam"), a partner of Messrs. Ernst and Younginvolved in the liquidation of Holdings, identify and I accept as that of Mr. Tan together with a date which reads "5/5/81". Althoughneither Mr. Li nor Mr. Lam are handwriting experts, each of them has, in the course of their respective earlier investigations intorespectively the CIL collapse carried out between 1983 and 1987 and the Holdings liquidation, come across Mr. Tan's signature a sufficientnumber of times and so achieved a degree of familiarity with it as to enable him to recognise the same with ease.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> To the left of the signature is another handwritten notation in black ink which, as the evidence of Mr. Meocre Li shows which I accept,is Miss Law's handwriting and which reads "out 5/5" indicating that the document was despatched on 5th May 1981 to "Chan &amp; Lai"meaning the Defendants (the firm's former name being Chan Lai &amp; Co. before the third partner Mr. Pang joined the other two resultingin 7th August 1980 in a change of name to the present one). Below the handwritten notations are calculations of profits made by Extramoneyin respect of CIL shares transferred to a sister company in the Carrian Group known as Carrian Travel Services Ltd ("Travel Services").</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> The last two typewritten pages (respectively the third and fourth pages of Exhibit 'p2') consist of two unsigned letters both dated6th May 1981 apparently addressed to Mr. Tan as can be seen from the notation "Dear George" typewritten at the top of each letter(collectively "the 'Dear Georgeâ Letters"). The first 'Dear George' Letter (being the third page of Exhibit 'P2') is headed "TRAVELDIVISION" (which the evidence shows and I accept to be a composite reference to number of travel service related companies withinthe Carrian Group, namely, Travel Services, Kent Travel Ltd., Farallon Air and Sea Travel Ltd.) followed by a series of calculationsincluding those pertaining to profits from trading in CIL shares which replicate the figures for the first and last transactionslisted in the Profit Schedule.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The second 'Dear George' Letter (being the last page of Exhibit 'P2') is important wherefor I make no apology for setting out thetext verbatim:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAbove [sic] the HK$100 million profit (1  ) of the Carrian Finance Limited â OKASAN STATEMENT, I propose to consolidate thisprofit in the accounts of âExtramoney Limited,â for</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">1) "Extramoney" is engaged in del ing in "C.I.L.

At one stage, the Plaintiffsattempted to bolster this theory by referring to what they contend is Mr. Lam's handwriting at the very bottom of respectively thefirst 'Dear George' Letter which reads "P.S. These are Thomas Lai's reply &amp; OK is written 'by Mr. Tan", and also the second 'DearGeorge' Letter which reads "P.S: Same as page 1", such page reference being, presumably, to the first 'Dear George' Letter. WhenMr. Lam subsequently gave evidence, however, he specifically denied ever inscribing those comments and protested that, in any event,he never wrote on original documents. As matters turned out, no-one was ever called to testify to being the author of the comments,when they were written or, more importantly, the basis for the conclusions therein stated. Accordingly, I hold the manuscript commentsto be wholly inadmissible for the purpose of proving the authorship of the 'Dear George' Letters.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> In the meantime, Mr. Lai who was cross-examined on the issue hotly denied ever writing the âDear George' Letters. Having seen thelatter testify and having regard to the patently unprofessional nature of the drafting as well as presentation of the two letters,the same being plagued with grammatical and typographical errors and typewritten on blank sheets of paper with no letterhead as opposedto the Defendants' own stationery as would befit correspondence by a professional accountant to an important client and which are,moreover, left unsigned, I accept Mr. Lai's evidence he is not the author of the 'Dear George' Letters.  Without reaching any positiveconclusion as to the authorship of such documents since the requisite evidence for the making of any such finding has not emerged,I nevertheless find the 'Dear George' Letters, partly because of the careless manner in which they were drafted and typewritten butmore importantly for the reasons set out below, to be authentic contemporaneous documents addressed to Mr. Tan suggesting and detailinghow certain share trading profits should be treated, which suggestions were apparently accepted by Mr. Tan.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> A number of important points emerge from the âDear George' Letters. First of all, the two dates, both 6th May 1981, attributedthereto appear to be authentic since the Letters were clearly written after the issuing of the Okasan Statement and certainly afterthe carrying out of the share transactions which gave rise to the Disputed Profit. The reference at the bottom of the first 'DearGeorge' Letter to the second and third transactions depicted therein appearing in "Carrian Finance Limited - OKASAN STATEMENT" bearsthis out.  Secondly, the precise matching of all the other calculations relating to the first and last transactions listed in theProfit Schedule with the second and third transactions appearing in the first 'Dear George' Letter reinforces the notion of the genuinenessof the transactions listed in the Profit Schedule. Thirdly, the existence of an error in the calculation of the unit cost of theshares comprised in the last transaction depicted in the first 'Dear George' Letter, which error is not repeated in the matchingninth sale listed in the Profit Schedule, would tend to indicate that the Profit Schedule was drawn up after the 'Dear George' Lettershad already been written and despatched.  The foregoing hypothesis of the subsequent creation of the Profit Schedule is supportedby the absence of any reference in the 'Dear George' Letters to the existence of the former document. Thus it would appear that,in terms of chronology, the Okasan Statement appears earliest, to be followed next by the 'Dear Georgeâ Letters with the ProfitSchedule coming last.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Fourthly, the first 'Dear George' Letter shows that the first and last transactions listed in the Profit Schedule, which togetherwith the other seven listed transactions make up the Disputed Profit, were carried out by "Travel Division" rather than Extramoney.This impression is reinforced by my fifth observation which is that the second 'Dear George' Letter records a suggestion dated 6thMay 1981 made to Mr. Tan to consolidate in Extramoney the profits derived from the CIL share-dealing shown on the Okasan Statementsince "'Extramoney' is engaged in dealing in 'CIL' shares only".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> This leads me to my sixth and final observation which is that respectively the implication in the 'Dear Georgeâ Letters that certainprofits arising from CIL share dealings were not made by Extramoney and the express suggestion that such profits should be transferredto Extramoney are both confirmed by the summary appearing at the bottom of the Profit Schedule itself which states that an amountof some HK$86 million entered under 'The Co.' sub-column should be transferred to an entity designated âthe Co." whilst the HK$15odd million entered under the 'Travel Division' sub-column should likewise be transferred to âthe Co." thereby making up the compositetotal of HK$101 million being the amount of the Disputed Profit. Although the entity referred to in the Profit Schedule as âtheCo.â is nowhere therein defined, it is clear that such entity, to which the Disputed Profit was to be transferred, never made suchprofit by itself in the first place.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> All of the above leads me to the inexorable conclusion that the original transactions carried out over the 1980 Period as recordedin the Okasan Statement were not at the material time carried out by or, indeed, even intended to be carried out in the name of Extramoneyand that it was only in mid-1981 that, for what appears to be group accounting reasons, Mr. Tan decided pursuant to suggestions torecord the Disputed Profit as belonging to Extramoney. Although there was some suggestion at the hearing as to whether the real motiveunderlying such profit attribution was to inflate the profits of Extramoney, they amount to no more than mere speculation and donot assist my determination of the issue and in any event do not, as a theory, sit at all comfortably with the uncontroverted factsof, firstly, the year-end HK$132 million provision for diminution in value of CIL shares retained by Extramoney and, secondly, theHK$46 million management fee charged to Extramoney by Holdings. Of the HK$132 million provision for diminution in value of CIL sharesretained, the evidence shows that HK$127 millions' worth came from shares transferred to Extramoney from an associate company withinthe Carrian Group called Filomena Limited ("Filomena") which, prior to such transfer, held a majority interest in CIL being the CarrianGroup's core interest in ClL. In 1980 Filomena traded in CIL shares and at the year-end sold what it had not disposed of on the marketat above the market price to Extramoney thereby creating a provision in the accounts of Extramoney and a corresponding profit orextraordinary item in the accounts of Filomena. More to the point, whatever be Mr. Tan's real motive (and the same is not importantfor present purposes), the evidence shows that he decided more than five months after the year-end, for group accounting reasons,to put into the books of Extramoney the Disputed Profit generated over the 1980 Period by market dealings in CIL shares carried outin the name of Finance.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Efficacy of Post Year-end Attribution of Profits</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Is the post year-end injection of profits of another company into Extramoney legitimate in terms of accounting treatment? More accurately,would Mr. Tan's decision reached in May 1981 being almost half a year after the close of the 1980 Period and, more importantly, someconsiderable time after the actual transaction dates be effective in rendering the Disputed Profit one which was made by Extramoneyover the 1980 Period? This was how Question (1) ultimately presented itself at the end of the trial. Mr. Adrian Hamilton Q.C., whoappears for the Defendants, was highly critical of what he termed the chameleon-like changes in the case advanced against his clientsfrom one of "totally fictitious" or non-existent profit (as originally described by one of the Liquidators in a statutory declarationmade on 31st March 1987 towards the close of the investigatory stage prior to the commencement of these proceedings but who nevergave evidence at the trial) to a question of proper accounting treatment but, while I am not unsympathetic to the difficulties whichmay confront a party in having to meet an opponent's shifting front, I do not regard the attack made of the Plaintiffs' case to bewarranted. In my view, their stance may, subject only to the parameters laid down in the pleadings, legitimately be adapted in linewith changing circumstances and the evidence which emerged as the trial progressed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> I received starkly conflicting answers from the experts on this ultimate question. I should mention here before canvassing theirevidence that, not only do I intend and imply no criticism of either expert by reference to such conflict, but I regard the expertwitnesses called by respectively the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to be very highly qualified and experienced, each of whom gaveclear and succinct evidence and, in my view, did their level best to assist me in the resolution of all questions on which theirexpertise might shed some light.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> There was, at one stage, some criticism made by Defence Counsel of the partiality and suitability of Mr. Meocre Li acting for thePlaintiffs as an expert on accounting and auditing standards and practices in the light of his previous involvement assisting theCCB in their investigation into the causes of the collapse of Carrian Group from 1983 to 1987, an aspect of Mr. Li's curriculum vitaeto which I have already adverted in earlier passages of this Judgment. I accept, of course, that it is unfortunate and undesirablefor anyone previously involved in the investigation of facts leading to conclusions that may have prompted the commencement of proceedingsto testify as an expert witness in relation to issues the subject of those very proceedings, since (the witness's honesty and integritynot being in doubt) a clear risk nevertheless arises of one or more parties challenging his expert opinion on the basis that it mayhave been prejudiced or at least coloured, even if only subconsciously, by his factual findings. That risk materialised in the presentcase. However, I bear in mind, first of all, that neither the controversy surrounding the Disputed Profit nor, indeed, any otheractivities concerning Extramoney (as opposed to some other conclusions drawn by the CCB as a result of their aforesaid investigations)ever led to criminal or other proceedings against Mr. Tan. Secondly and more importantly, having seen and heard Mr. Meocre Li testifyin the witness box, I am impressed by his professionalism and am wholly satisfied that, whilst the findings of the CIL investigationlay not surprisingly at the back of his mind in (indeed, he confessed in cross-examination that his problem was that he could not"shut off the knowledge that [he had] gained from the previous investigation"), Mr. Li never allowed such matters to cloud or otherwiseaffect his expert assessment of the issues in the instant case but, on the contrary, expressly limited the basis of his opinion tothe material available to the parties. </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> I should also mention at this juncture that both the Plaintiffs' and the Defendants' experts were clearly agreed on one importantpoint, namely, that it would be improper and unacceptable for a company to record after the year-end a profit or other transactionthat had not taken place during the year. They appeared to be divided on the further question whether a 100% beneficial owner andcontroller (such as Mr. Tan) of a private company (such as Extramoney) could properly attribute profit which he had made (eitherpersonally or through another entity) during the year to that company after the year-end. The following discussion shows how theirlater evidence emerged and the ultimate issue crystallised.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> Mr. Kenneth Morrison, both a chartered and a certified public accountant of some 20 years' standing, much of it in auditing and auditreview, called by the Defendants as their expert, concluded that if the Defendants did receive representations from Mr. Tan thatthe shares in question were purchased on behalf of Extramoney and if the Defendants did sight supporting documentation relating tothe sales of the 9,208,000 CIL shares, such evidence would support the inclusion of the Disputed Profit in the books of Extramoney.Mr. Morrison was heavily cross-examined by Mr. Griffiths on the question whether an auditor must guard against the natural tendencyof a controlling shareholder or the management of a company to rewrite corporate history, particularly in the context of group accountswhere it might be beneficial for tax or other reasons to shift after the year-end profit from one subsidiary to another. Mr. Morrison'sresponse was that a reasonably careful auditor would have to ensure that the accounts present a true and fair view of the state ofaffairs of the company. As became clear subsequently, this could not fairly be described as an evasive answer to Counsel's questionfor Mr. Morrison was asked, as the questioning progressed, to focus on an auditor's need to guard against the "improperâ shiftingof such profits after the year-end. This begged, of course, the question of what type or genre of post year-end profit-shifting fromone subsidiary to another might be considered improper.  Mr. Morrison plainly took the view that group management may after the year-endlegitimately assess where transactions occurring within the year should appropriately be booked, the expression "appropriately" meaningwhere such booking accurately reflects the facts as they occurred during the year. Thus, as I understand Mr. Morrison's evidence,Mr. Tan's market dealings in CIL shares over the 1980 Period could only be booked with Extramoney after 1980 provided Mr. Tan wasat the material time of undergoing such transactions in 1980 acting for and on behalf of Extramoney. Otherwise, Mr. Tan's creditingof his personal profit to Extramoney after 1980 would constitute a gift (as opposed to a trading profit) and therefore not subjectto taxation. As will become apparent when I consider Mr. Meocre Li's opinion later in this Judgment, there is little or no differencebetween Mr. Morrison's view in this regard and the conclusions of Mr. Li.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> In questioning by me after the completion of re-examination by Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Morrison, however, expanded on his earlier answersgiven in cross-examination in at least three aspects and qualified such earlier answers in one important regard. He says, first ofall, that the booking of management fees after the year-end is legitimate even where no decision had been reached during the yearas to the charging of such fees since the latter would tend to be arrived at after the balance sheet date. Other legitimate postyear-end adjustments are provisions against doubtful debts and provisions against obsolete inventory. What Mr. Morrison said he wouldnot countenance was the booking of a profit after the year-end if the transaction had not occurred during the year, which I taketo mean where the event underlying the post year-end adjustment had not taken place within the financial year under consideration.The foregoing three examples of post year-end adjustments would appear, therefore, to conform with his stated principle that thebook entry must accurately reflect the facts as they had occurred during the year.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> Mr. Morrison went on to say, however, that where a profit had been generated within a given financial year but it is unclear whetherthe person responsible for generating such profit had at the material time been acting for himself or on behalf of one of a numberof different companies which he wholly owned and controlled, that individual can freely choose after the year-end the company withwhich to book the profit provided that he beneficially owned 100% of all the companies to be selected for this treatment. The factthat the company thus favoured had to be 100% beneficially owned such that there are no minority interests affected one way or anotherwas the essential qualification given by Mr. Morrison to his earlier answer. Provided that essential condition was satisfied, suchex post facto accounting treatment would, according to him, be permissible and efficacious even where the transaction giving riseto the profit had not originally been undergone on behalf of the selected company.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> The introduction by Mr. Morrison of this important exception to his stated general rule that the accounts in order to present a trueand fair view must accurately reflect events as they had occurred during the year exposes, however, his opinion to criticism andhas the effect, ultimately, of undermining the same.  First of all, such an exception contradicts Mr. Morrison I s earlier testimonythat Mr. Tan's market dealings in CIL shares over the 1980 Period could only be booked with Extramoney after 1980 provided Mr. Tanwas, at the time of such dealings, acting as Extramoney's agent; otherwise, the post year-end booking of profits arising from thosedealings with Extramoney could properly be effected only by registering a gift from Mr. Tan to Extramoney and the same would notattract profits tax assessment. Secondly, the exception postulated by Mr. Morrison would appear to ignore the fundamental principleof law as well as accounting that a set of accounts ought to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company and thetransactions undergone during the year since accounts incorporating a post year-end profit attribution would not, ex hypothesi, giveany such a view of the company's acts and dealings over the year under consideration.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> Mr. Meocre Li's position appears, on the other hand, to be free of such internal and other contradictions. Mr. Li had already agreedin earlier cross-examination that there was nothing unusual in the fact of there being year-end adjustments in any given year. Uponhis recall following the completion of Mr. Morrison's testimony to deal with the question whether it would be proper for a 100% beneficialowner of a company to attribute profits after the year-end to such company where the transactions giving rise to the profits hadnot been undergone during the year on behalf of that company, Mr. Li expanded on the above subject. While he agreed with Mr. Morrisonthat such matters as management fees, provisions for bad debts and inventory obsolescence could properly form the subject of year-endadjustments, he staunchly disputed the latter's suggestion that a 100% beneficial owner of two or more companies could enjoy a freehand in deciding where to book the profits ex post facto. According to Mr. Li, a person seeking to act as an agent for another mustdecide, prior to entering into the transactions in question, for whom he intends so to act. Translated into a general principle,Mr. Li expressed the view that it was essential for "the transactions, the events, the meeting of the minds to take place prior [to]or at the year-end". In other words, in Mr. Li's view, a profit can only be booked as a profit in the company which actually madeit and, whereas one can transfer profits generated by one company into another's accounts, such monies cannot properly be transferredqua profits. This was entirely consistent with his previous evidence given in earlier cross-examination by Mr. Hamilton that "therelationship between the principal and the agent would have to be established at the time or prior to the transactionâ and notafterwards.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> Mr. Li offers by way of ratio for his distinction the fact that the practice of making year-end profit and loss adjustments is opento abuse and that readers of financial statements would be misled into believing that something had happened during the year whichplainly had not taken place. Mr. Li's objection to allowing a 100% beneficial owner of various companies to decide after the year-endwhere among those companies to book the profit he made during the year is that such practice would enable the owner to manipulatethe accounts and render the task of auditing impossible since it would not be possible then for such massaged accounts to give atrue and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at the balance sheet date, namely, the year-end. Hence it is crucial, acccordingto Mr. Li, to determine at the point of time the transaction was conducted the identity of the principal on whose behalf the transactionwas conducted, namely, the person or entity who would take the profit or bear the loss.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> In my judgment, there is much to commend in Mr. Li's opinion. I need add only two further observations of my own.  First of all,profits attributed after the year-end to one company must also mean that they have been either taken way from or not given to another. Secondly, if the practice of attributing profits ex post facto means that it must, by definition, also operate in reverse in relationto another company in the group, such a practice must additionally operate in relation to losses. A person who has incurred a losspersonally may decide, for the purpose of securing fiscal advantage or other reasons, to attribute a loss to one of his wholly-ownedcompanies instead of carrying it himself.  The principle that accounts ought to give a true and fair view of the state of affairsof a company and the transactions undergone over the year would be hopelessly compromised if an individual could, after the year-end,by a whim either confer a windfall upon any company which he wholly beneficially owned or deprive the same of its profits properlygenerated over the year or, alternatively, attribute a loss to a company which had never sustained one during the period in question.In conclusion, I find by reason of its logic, coherence and consistency with legal principles coupled with, as I have earlier mentioned,an absence of internal contradictions, no difficulty accepting Mr. Liâs view as regards the propriety and efficacy of post year-endtransfers of profit in preference to that of Mr. Morrison.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> Mr. Li was further cross-examined on the legitimacy and efficacy of intra-group transfers of profit from Filomena to Extramoney atthe end of the 1980 Period as compared with that which took place between Finance and Extramoney in May 1981. He sought to justifythe Filomena transfer on the basis that âso long as proper disclosures were made so that the readers of financial statements canask questions if necessary, including the tax authorities if they need to, then I can see that the financial statements can stillshow a true and fair view". When questioned further by Mr. Griffiths after being recalled, he expressed the view that if an ownerof a company were minded to inject into that company profits which he had made either personally or from another source, he coulddo so either by way of a gift of capital (which would not, ex hypothesi, attract profits tax) or record it as an extraordinary itemand make a disclosure of the nature of such item as being, in reality, a de facto gift, which course of action, although in Mr. Li'sview "less preferrable", would nevertheless be proper.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> Mr. Li was challenged on this last point by Mr. Hamilton referring to the <i>Hong Kong society of Accountants'</i> <i>("HKSA")</i> <i>Statement No. 114</i>, a document accepted by all parties as laying down proper standards of accounting practice to be observed by members of the profession,which requires all extraordinary items to be accounted for through the profit and loss account rather than through reserves. "Extraordinaryitems" are defined in the statement as "those items which derive from events or transactions outside the ordinary activities of thebusiness and which are both material and expected not to recur frequently or regularly". The statement recognises the existence oftwo different points of view on the treatment of, inter alia, extraordinary items. One was that, so as to avoid distortion, the profitand loss account for the year should include only the normal recurring trading activities of the business. The other view (advocatedby the statement) was that the profit and loss account for the year should include and show separately all extraordinary items whichare recognised for that year since inclusion would give a better view of profitability and progress whereas exclusion, being a matterof subjective judgment, could lead to variations and loss of comparability. between reported results of companies and could resultin extraordinary items being overlooked over a series of years. Mr. Li accepted eventually that treating such injection of moneyby Mr. Tan (assuming such to be the case) as an extraordinary item in Extramoney's profit and loss account would be legitimate and,if so treated, the same would be available for distribution. Upon questioning by me, Mr. Li also accepted that it would be legitimateto transfer, after the year-end, profit earned by one company to another in the same group provided it is entered in the books ofthe latter company as an extraordinary profit whereafter it would be available for distribution.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> At the end of the day, however, the above discussion of the proper treatment of extraordinary items is academic since the DisputedProfit was not recorded or treated as such in Extramoney's books. Further, since there is nothing in Mr. Li's further testimony whichin any way undermines his statement of the imperative for the accounts properly to reflect events as they had occurred in the yearunder consideration, I am not swayed in my acceptance of the validity of his opinion in preference to that of Mr. Morrison.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Relevance of Mr. Tan's Alleqed Oral Representations</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> Before leaving Question (1), I must turn finally to consider the Defendants' allegation that Mr. Tan, in answer to queries made byMr. Lai during the auditing process, made oral representations to the latter to the effect that Extramoney made the Disputed Profitover the 1980 Period. There are a number of problems surrounding the making of such an allegation which renders the same ineffectivein advancing the Defendants' case in determining Question (1).</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> To begin with, the Plaintiffs seek to cast doubt on the veracity of this allegation by reference to the total absence of writtenrecords and memoranda of such representations whether within the Defendants' audit working papers or elsewhere. Mr. Lai of the Defendantsfreely admitted that he did not ask for a letter of representation or a board resolution or a declaration of trust because he thoughtthe documents produced could support what Mr. Tan had orally represented. That it is better practice for auditors to record suchoral representations by their client is clearly borne out by <i>HKSA statement No. 118</i> recommending the securing of "letters of representations i.e. written confirmation by the client of information and opinions expressedin respect of matters such as stock values and amounts of current and contingent liabilities" and <i>HKSA Practice Guideline No. 9</i> recommending that auditors should attempt to obtain all clients' representations in writing.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> However, having seen and heard Mr. Lai of the Defendants give evidence as to the making of such representations by Mr. Tan, I donot doubt that he was telling me the truth and, further, bearing in mind the size of the Defendants' firm and the nature of theirpractice, I have come to the view that the absence of such documentary evidence demonstrates regrettable non-compliance by the Defendantswith the standards of professional practice laid down by the HKSA rather than mendacity on Mr. Lai's part in giving evidence.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> The real problem with Mr. Lai's allegations of oral representations by Mr. Tan lies in the fact that, Mr. Tan not having been calledto testify, such allegations whilst no doubt relevant to showing Mr. Lai's state of mind and belief (a matter to which I shall revertin canvassing Question (2) below) is inadmissible hearsay for the purposes of establishing the truth of such representations.  Putmore fundamentally, even if the fact be established that Mr. Tan did make those representations to Mr. Lai, that in no way provesthat the position thus represented is true. On the contrary, the contention underlying Mr. Tan' s representations is flatly contradictedby all the documentary evidence hereinabove canvassed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> This then disposes of the remaining issue under Question (1) and I reiterate my findings by way of conclusion that, while the DisputedProfit was indeed generated as matter of fact over the 1980 Period, it was not generated by Extramoney. I further find that the postyear-end decision of Mr. Tan (albeit the 100% beneficial owner and controller of Extramoney and Finance) to put the Disputed Profitgenerated over 1980 in the name of Finance into Extramoney's books for the 1980 Period was inefficacious in rendering the DisputedProfit the trading profit of Extramoney for the 1980 Period.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>NEGLIGENCE and BREACH of CONTRACTUAL and STATUTORY DUTIES</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> Having found as a fact in answer to Question (1) the Disputed Profit to have been made during the 1980 Period though not by Extramoney,the next question for my determination is whether the Defendants were negligent or otherwise in breach of contractual or other dutyin certifying Extramoney's 1980 Accounts (which incorporate the Disputed Profit as the company's trading profits for that year) aspresenting a true and fair view of its state of affairs.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> There is no doubting the proposition I have earlier mentioned that the overall burden of establishing negligence on the part of theDefendants lies with the Plaintiffs. There is equally no controversy surrounding the question of standard of proof inasmuch as, havingregard to the gravity of the Plaintiffsâ allegations, clear proof of negligence or breach of duty on the part of the Defendantsis required in the circumstances of this case: <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence, 3rd ed., para. 1-05</i> and <i>Note 14 on p. 5</i>, <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence, 8th ed., para. 8.07,</i> <u>Dwyer v. Roderick</u> (unrep.) The Times November 12th 1983, <u>Hucks v. Cole</u> (unrep.) The Times May 9th 1968.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> The Defendants' duties qua auditors of Extramoney's 1980 Accounts are variously defined by statute, the pronouncements of the HongKong society of Accountants ("the HKSA") and the common law. I propose to consider those duties in reverse order.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>AUDITORS' DUTY of CARE and CONTRACTUAL DUTY</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> What is the ambit of the Defendants' contractual and other duties under the common law?  The primary duty of an auditor auditingthe books and accounts of a company is succinctly defined by Lindley L.J. in <u>Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co. (No.2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 179 (CA)</a> at 284 as a duty "to examine the books, ascertain that they are right, and to prepare a balance-sheet shewing the true financialposition of the company at the time to which the balance-sheet refers". The experts are also agreed that the standard of auditingrequired is the same whether a large or a small firm were involved.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> Thus, given my finding in course of answering Question (1) that the post year-end attribution to Extramoney of the Disputed Profitgenerated during 1980 in the name of Finance is ineffective in properly rendering the same the trading profits of Extramoney forthe 1980 Period, the Defendants' preparation of Extramoney's and Holdings' Balance Sheets incorporating the Disputed Profit as thetrading profits of Extramoney and certification of such accounts to be true and fair constitutes a prima facie breach of this primaryduty owed to their clients the Plaintiffs. Given that the legal burden of showing negligence or other breach of duty remains alwayswith the Plaintiffs, can the Defendants nevertheless shift the tactical burden of demonstrating that they have taken all reasonableprecautions in their auditing task that a reasonably prudent auditor would have taken under the particular circumstances of the case?</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a> To be fair to the Defendants, a brief recapitulation of both the uncontroversial background facts and a more detailed examinationMr. Lai's evidence, qua partner of the Defendants in charge of the audit of Extramoney, of the various steps which he says were taken(including the receipt of oral representations from Mr. Tan and sight of certain documentary supportings) to verify the existenceof the Disputed Profit, justify its inclusion in Extramoney's and Holdings' 1980 Accounts and validate the Defendants' certificationthereof as being true and fair are warranted. I should note at this juncture that, having seen and heard Mr. Lai testify, I am satisfiedthat, although his testimony is not wholly free of inconsistencies, Mr. Lai was basically telling me the truth as regards the stepsin the course" of verification which he said he took.  Certain implications of the evidential rule against the admission of hearsayevidence should nevertheless be borne in mind in considering Mr. Lai's testimony of, first of all, Mr. Tan's supposed oral representationsto him and, secondly, the contents of the  supportings.  It must not be forgotten that, Mr. Tan never having emerged to testify andto the extent that a considerable portion of the supportings which Mr. Lai says he saw at the time of the audit were not availableat the trial, Mr. Lai' s aforesaid testimony is inadmissible for the purposes of establishing the truth of either Mr. Tan's allegedrepresentations or the contents of the supportings (to the extent that the same were not adduced by way of documentary evidence atthe hearing) but are relevant only to showing the information made available to Mr. Lai at the time of the audit.</p>        <p class="heading">Mr. Lai's Testimony</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a>The Defendants commenced their audit of Extramoney's 1980 Accounts in March 1981 and completed the same on 8th April of the same year,with the accounts being signed off on 8th January of the following year.  Throughout the audit, Mr. Lai said that he met Mr. Tanthree times to take and clarify instructions.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> On 25th March 1981, according to Mr. Lai, a member of Holdings' in-house accounting staff Miss Florence Ho submitted to him for audita trial balance of Extramoney drawn up by her which showed gross proceeds of sale of CIL shares of some HK$482 million and the costof CIL shares sold as HK$262 million leaving a profit of approximately HK$220 million. Mr. Lai and his audit team thereupon checkedthe trial balance as against Extramoney's ledger accounts whereafter they prepared in draft a balance sheet and a profit and lossaccount showing the same figure by way of profit, namely, HK$220 odd million as aforesaid. The draft balance sheet and profit andloss account were then submitted to Miss Ho for approval.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> It is striking to note that when Miss Ho, the in-house accountant, prepared the trial balance she did not include the Disputed Profitas part of the profits of Extramoney. Neither did Mr. Lai and his audit team when they prepared the draft balance sheet and profitand loss account. This is hardly surprising since the Disputed Profit did not appear in the books and records of Extramoney whichthey had then examined. I shall revert later to the significance of the above points.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> Shortly after the submission of the draft balance sheet and profit and loss account, Miss Ho notified Mr. Lai that Mr. Tan wishedto see him. At a meeting at Mr. Tan's office sometime between 25th March and 8th April 1981, Mr. Tan told Mr. Lai that he had profitablyconducted on behalf of Extramoney certain dealings in CIL shares using a margin account opened in the name of Finance with the stockbrokersOkasan wherefor he wished to account for such profit to Extramoney. He asked Mr. Lai to check with Miss Ho as to whether the HK220million profit figure shown on the draft balance sheet and profit and loss account included such profit. According to Mr. Lai, Mr.Tan further informed him that he had also bought on behalf of Extramoney other CIL shares on eight separate margin accounts openedwith Okasan in the names of various nominees all surnamed Lam.  Since these other shares had yet to be disposed of, Mr. Tan askedMr. Lai to check with Miss Ho to ensure that the same were included in Extramoney's closing inventory.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> After the meeting, Mr. Lai checked through Extramoney's books and records but failed to unearth any relevant statements issued byOkasan supporting Mr. Tan's oral representations. Indeed, he found no record of dealings in CIL shares through Okasan either in thebooks of Extramoney or those of Finance. One or two days thereafter, Mr. Lai met Mr. Tan again at the latter's office. It was onthe occasion of this second meeting that Mr. Tan handed to Mr. Lai two softcover manila folders, the first containing two identicalcopies of the Okasan Statement showing market acquisitions of CIL shares in an account opened in the name of Finance accompaniedby a bundle of bought and sold notes and the second containing margin account statements by Okasan relating to 8 different accountsheld by various persons all surnamed Lam again accompanied by another bundle of copies of bought and sold notes. Mr. Tan pointedout to Mr. Lai that that he had personally paid the margin interest due on the account covered by the Okasan Statement and that,notwithstanding the name of the account-holder being Finance, all purchases of CIL shares made between 18th July and 13th August1980 as shown on pages 1 to 6 of thereof were made on behalf of Extramoney whilst all purchases made thereafter were for the accountof Perak Pioneer.  Mr. Tan also told Mr. Lai that, of the profit derived from the aforesaid sales of CIL shares, some HK$15 millionbelonged to the Travel Division of the Carrian Group.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a> After the second meeting, Mr. Lai took away the two folders and computed from the Okasan Statement that the purchases of CIL sharesmade between 18th July and 13th August totalled 9,208,000. He also verified such acquisitions as against the bought notes in thefirst manila folder. Mr. Lai testified that all the bought notes covering acquisitions between 18th July and 13th August 1980 wereavailable at the time he made the aforesaid audit although at the trial, only the ones supporting acquisitions made on 13th August1980 could be adduced in evidence. I pause to note that the absence of the other bought notes is a matter of no moment since theauthencity of the Okasan Statement has not been challenged.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="pseudopara" id="p121">121.</a> Thereafter Mr. Lai says that he examined the sold notes enclosed within the first manila folder and found that the aforesaid 9,208,000CIL shares previously acquired under Finance's name had, together with accretions arising from two bonus issues, apparently beensold under nine separate lots. Mr. Lai thereupon asked his audit assistant Mr. Lee to prepare a schedule of sales after specificallydrawing to Mr. Lee's attention the fact that there was, after the disposal of the first and second lots, a six for ten bonus issueand, after the eighth disposal, a four for ten bonus issue. He also explained to Mr. Lee that the third disposal should be treatedas a notional sale to Mr. Tan and that the pay order should be treated as a sell-back to Extramoney.  Mr. Lai further pointed outto Mr. Lee that, of the profits, an amount of some HK$15 million should be attributed to the Travel Division.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="pseudopara" id="p122">122.</a> According to Mr. Lai, Mr. Lee duly prepared a schedule of sales being the document which was referred to at the trial and throughoutthis Judgment as the Profit Schedule showing a profit of HK$101 odd million arising from the sales of CIL shares in nine lots andhanded the same to Mr. Lai. The latter I thereafter verified the nine transactions therein listed as against the available sold notes,making in the process rough notes on pieces of paper which he discarded at the end of the audit.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> Mr. Lai testified that, in the course of the aforesaid verification exercise, he found, in relation to the first of the nine saleslisted in the Profit Schedule, sold notes to support the sale of 900,000 CIL shares and, although he did not find cheques or pay-inslips, he concluded that 900,000 CIL shares were sold on the market. The second disposal being of 320,000 CIL shares was, accordingto Mr. Lai, supported by a handwritten memo stating "Take delivery of 320,000 shares @ HK$8.60 per share" by which Mr. Lai concludedthat Mr. Tan had taken delivery of 320,000 CIL shares at the stated price. The third disposal listed in the Profit Schedule was supportedby a handwritten memo which reads "Return old shares 2,780,000 (new shares 4,448,000) to Extramoney" and a pay order.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> According to Mr. Lai, the fourth to seventh disposals listed in the Profit Schedule was supported by C &amp; M sold notes and photocopiesof cheques beneath which were notes as to the amount of shares sold and the name of the purchaser.  Mr. Lai duly noted that becausethe sixth listed disposal generated a profit of a little over HK$15 million, Mr. Lee had thought it convenient to attribute the sameto the Travel Division.  The eighth disposal was supported by photocopies of two cheques and two pay-in slips concerning respectivelyMr. Alex Fung and Mr. Lawrence Lam's respective purchases of 500,000 CIL shares each.  The ninth disposal was supported by a C &amp;M sold note and a photocopy of a cheque and the said photocopy specified the number of shares sold and the name of the purchaser. From the above exercise, Mr. Lai concluded that the first, fourth to seventh and ninth disposals were all made to outsiders andthat the second disposal was to Mr. Tan himself.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a> Upon completion of the verification exercise, Mr. Lai confirmed that all the aforeaid 9,208,000 CIL shares acquired in the name ofFinance between 18th July and 13th August 1980 had together with bonus issues been sold.   Mr. Lai then initialled the middle ofthe sixth page of the Okasan Statement and inscribed two lines underneath his initials to indicate to his audit team that 13th August1980 was to be regarded as the cutoff date for acquisitions made on behalf of Extramoney.  I pause to note at this juncture thatone of the factual substrata underlying the conclusions set out in Mr. Meocre Li's report is, as Mr. Li freely concedes in cross-examination,the assumption that the Defendants did not see the Okasan Statement during the course of the audit. This assumption is clearly wrongsince I accept Mr. Lai's evidence that his initials appearing in the middle of page 6 of the Okasan Statement were inscribed at theconclusion of the verification exercise. However, in view of my conclusion on Question (1) that the Disputed Profit could not properlytreated as the profit of Extramoney, the fact that the Defendants saw and read the Okasan Statement in the course of the audit doesnot dispose of the ultimate question as to whether they had acted negligently or otherwise in breach of duty owed to the Plaintiffswhen they certified Extramoney's 1980 Accounts to be true and fair.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a> Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lai showed to Mr. Tan the Profit Schedule as drawn up at the time showing the attribution of the HK$15 millionprofit from the sixth transaction attributed to the Travel Division. This was the third and last time Mr. Lai met Mr. Tan prior tothe completion of the audit.  At this meeting, Mr. Lai sought clarification or confirmation of Mr. Tan's previous instructions toattribute HK$15 million worth of profits to the Travel Division. Mr. Tan examined the Profit Schedule and said that the profit derivedfrom the first of the nine sales therein listed should be attributed to Kent Travel while that derived from the ninth sale shouldgo to Farallon Air and sea Travel Ltd., both the aforesaid companies being members of the Carrian Group's Travel Division. The totalof the two aforesaid sets of profits came to around HK$15 million. The Profit Schedule was re-drafted to reflect the above instructions.Sometime shortly after the aforesaid meeting, Mr. Tan changed his mind and wanted the entirety of the HK$101 million put into thebooks of Extramoney. The re-draft of the Profit Schedule was duly amended by hand so as to attribute the whole of the Disputed Profitto âthe Co.â being a reference to Extramoney). This is the document with manuscript amendments appearing thereon a copy whereofeventually became produced by the Defendants at the trial as part of their audit file Exhibit 'D11'.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a> Mr. Lai and his audit team then prepared the balance sheet and profit and loss account of Extramoney showing the entirety of theDisputed Profit as part of the trading profits of Extramoney for the 1980 Period, completing the aforesaid task on 8th April 1981.On January 1982, the Defendants signed off the 1980 Accounts certifying the same in their report as being true 'and fair. Had theDefendants discharged their duties and exercised all reasonable care as auditors?</p>        <p class="heading"><u>Impact of Mr. Lai's Testimony</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a> In my judgment, even allowing for the existence of documentary supportings of the generation of the Disputed Profit as deposed toby Mr. Lai, Mr. Tan's oral representation that the same should be considered the profit of Extramoney was never free from doubt sincethe supportings merely indicate the making of such profit but do not point to Extramoney as the maker thereof.  On the contrary,as I have already found in the course of answering Question (1), they point away from Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="pseudopara" id="p129">129.</a> Further, none of the aforesaid supportings could be found among the original books and records of Extramoney which Mr. Lai and hisaudit team had earlier examined after being presented with the trial balance by Miss Florence Ho on 25th March 1981.  By contrast,the purchases of CIL shares in the names of the 8 Lams were documented in the books of Extramoney and in the Defendants' audit workingpapers. Similarly, all the acquisitions of CIL shares made after 17th September 1980 as shown on the Okasan Statement and representedby Mr. Tan to be for the account of Perak Pioneer could be verified from Perak Pioneer's books and records to have been paid forby the latter and entered in its books.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="pseudopara" id="p130">130.</a> Mr. Lai nevertheless made no inquiries as to why they were not in the original books of the company and made the remarkable admissionin cross-examination that he had not even considered the matter at the time.  Neither did he inquire of Miss Ho as to whether shehad seen the new documentation before. I have already noted earlier that when Miss Ho prepared the trial balance on 25th March 1981she did not include the Disputed Profit as part of the profits of Extramoney.  Neither did Mr. Lai and his audit team include theDisputed Profit as part of the profits of Extramoney when they prepared the draft balance sheet and profit and loss account sincethe same did not appear in the books and records of Extramoney which they had then examined.  Each of the aforesaid points wouldhave put a reasonably prudent auditor on inquiry as to the reliability of the controller's oral representations that the DisputedProfit truly formed part of the trading profits of Extramoney as opposed to some other person or entity.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="pseudopara" id="p131">131.</a> Both experts as well as Mr. Lai are agreed on the following approach. First of all, that it would be totally improper for an auditormerely to accept the say so of the shareholder or the management even of a private company without verification. A reasonably prudentauditor should confirm management representations by reference to contemporaneous documentation. This is entirely consistent withwell-established legal principles:  see per Pennycuick J. in <u>Re Thomas Gerrard &amp; Son Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20Ch%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] Ch 455</a> at 477E; per Hobhouse J. in <u>Berg Sons &amp; Co.

He does not satisfy himself merely by being content that management is responsible and is satisfied about thematter ... Prima facie the auditor's job is to check material matters for himself from available documents and he does not ordinarilydo his job or audit if he merely seeks the assurance of another as to the check that other has made or as to his views as to theeffect of documents. In principle, an auditor is really in no different position from an skilled inquirer. To the inquirer in anyfield to know by direct examination is surer proof than to believe on the hearsay of others or by inference."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="pseudopara" id="p132">132.</a> Secondly, both experts and Mr. Lai are agreed that one of the matters an auditor has to guard against is the natural tendency ofmanagement to rewrite the corporate history of the past year if such a course entailed fiscal or other advantages. In the words ofthe Defence expert Mr. Morrison, "one takes a cautious approach to management representations rather than accepting everything wholeheartedly". Mr. Lai conceded the fact that since Mr. Tan being the 100% beneficial owner and controller of Extramoney is a related party tothe transaction, a reasonably careful auditor would have to approach his representations with caution.  Management manipulation ofcorporate financial results being a contingent evil which a reasonably careful auditor ought to guard against, Mr. Lai further agreedthat, borrowing the expression of Lopes L.J. in Re Kinqston Cotton Mill Co. (No. 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 279</a> at 289 and bearing in mind Lindley L.J. 's warning ibid. at 284 not to be overly suspicious, an auditor should act as "a watchdogbut not a bloodhound" .</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="pseudopara" id="p133">133.</a> More specifically, Mr. Lai accepted in cross-examination that, before he could include the Disputed Profit in Extramoney's 1980 Accountshe had to be satisfied of two matters, namely, that the Disputed Profit had been made as a matter of fact and that the same was madeby Extramoney as opposed to some other person or entity. Consistent with both experts' opinion, Mr. Lai also agreed that what isimpermissible and unlawful is to make an agreement after the year-end and then write it back into the previous yearâs accounts.The attribution of the Disputed Profit to Extramoney being based in large part on Mr. Tan's oral representations, how ought a reasonablycareful auditor to regard the documentary supportings?</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="pseudopara" id="p134">134.</a> It is plain in my judgment that a reasonably careful auditor looking at the documents contained in the two manila folders would note,first of all, that the Okasan Statement shows prima facie market purchases of CIL shares by Finance rather than Extramoney. Secondly,with the exception of the third disposal shown on the Profit Schedule of a block of 4,448,000 CIL shares, none of the CIL sharesacquired as shown on the Okasan Statement are entered in the books of Extramoney. Thirdly, none of the payments required for thevarious acquisitions of CIL shares as shown on the Okasan Statement appears in the books of Extramoney. Fourthly, margin paymentsto Okasan were made by Mr. Tan rather than Extramoney. Fifthly, dividends declared on the CIL shares acquired as shown on the OkasanStatement were paid to Mr. Tan rather than Extramoney. Sixthly, no liabilities owing to either Okasan or Tan or receivables fromeither of them are entered in the books of Extramoney. Seventhly, the very fact that the Okasan Statement itself is, according toMr. Tan, broken up into two parts with all acquisitions after 17th September 1980 being for Perak Pioneer a private company belongingto Mr. Tan and not to the Carrian Group would make a reasonably prudent auditor exercise caution when looking at that document. Finally,Mr. Tan's change of mind as to how he wished HK$15 million of the Disputed Profit to be dealt with (viz. initially to be creditedto the Travel Division, later to be attributed to Extramoney alongside the remainder of the Disputed Profit) ought to have soundedoff alarms bells inside the head of any reasonably prudent auditor as to whether any portion of the Disputed Proflt really properlybelonged to Extramoney. While the above list of reasonable queries is by no means exhaustive, none of the aforesaid ought to imbueany reasonably prudent auditor with confidence that Mr. Tan operating in the name of Finance was truly acting for Extramoney at thetime he engaged in those share dealings or that the Disputed Profit was profits of Extramoney over the 1980 Period. Did the Defendantspursue the above or any relevant inquiries?</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="pseudopara" id="p135">135.</a> I have to confess that the unfortunate impression I derive from Mr. Lai's evidence is that in 1981 when the audit was undertaken,he shared none of the above concerns or appreciated the implications thereof. On the contrary, I am driven to note that one of thesalient features of Mr. Lai's testimony is that he perceived his role during the later part of the audit as being (and, indeed, hesought) to justify ex post facto the events as shown on the Profit Schedule with a theory of disposal of the CIL shares so as toshow the making of the Disputed Profit by Extramoney as opposed to any other person or entity. It is noteworthy that Mr. Lai testifiedin chief that "as far as I was concerned, I was simply taking orders from Mr. Tan". Further, Superintendent Starling on interviewingMr. Lai on 12th June 1984 recorded in his contemporaneous notes Mr. Lai observing that "G. Tan was a pushy guy" in the context ofMr. Tan's request that Mr. Lai prepare an accountants' report (as opposed to an auditors' report) for management purposes in relationto the accounts of Holdings. While I have no wish to burden this Judgment with the details, it suffices to note that both reportswere prepared by Mr. Lai and his audit team labouring over the space of a weekend; both were signed by the Defendants on the followingMonday, the accountants' report earlier followed by he auditors' report; but the two reports annex accounts contain materially differentfigures. In sum, I do not get the impression that Mr. Lai approached the audit of Extramoney's 1980 Accounts, insofar as it concernedthe Disputed Profit, with even an open, let alone an inquiring mind.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="pseudopara" id="p136">136.</a> In this regard, no evidence is more telling than Mr. Lai's efforts in presenting a justification or reconciliation of the third disposalof 4,448,000 CIL shares shown on the Profit Schedule (already discussed briefly in the course of my answering Question (1)) as atransaction by Extramoney so as to make up part of the Disputed Profit, a tortuous and convoluted endeavour on Mr. Laiâs part thatwas 1ittle short of heroic given the unpromising material with which he was constrained to work. According to Mr. Lai's interpretationof the supportings, Mr. Tan purchased in August 1980 at the prevailing market price of HK$8.60 per share two lots of 2 million CILshares from himself as agent of Extramoney "to do a deal" on his own account. He sold 900,000 CIL shares leaving 3.1 million. Helater sold another 320,000 CIL shares. That left undisposed 2,780,000 CIL shares which increased by virtue of a bonus issue to 4,448,000CIL shares. According to Mr. Lai, Mr. Tan must have decided to return the shares to Extramoney but on 22nd August resold the sameback to Extramoney at HK$9.60 per share being the equivalent (after the bonus issue) of HK$15 per share or almost double the originalcost price. He then had to account to Extramoney for the very profit thus obtained from Extramoney. The difficulties surroundingthis story are further exacerbated by the contradiction between Extramoney's pay order to buy back 4,448,000 CIL shares at HK$9.60per share and a handwritten memo in Extramoney' s books which says "Return to Extramoney 2.78 million old shares (4.448 million newshares)". Even the Defendants' expert Mr. Morrison concedes in cross-examination that the above theory requires explanation since,one would not prima facie expect an agent to make a profit from his principal; nor would one expect to see an agent purchasing fromhis principal, having previously bought on the latter's behalf.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a> Mr. Lai did not apparently seek any explanation from Mr. Tan even though it is fair to say that he appreciated the difficulties surroundingthe theory. While I have no doubt that Mr. Lai conscientiously considered long and hard the most satisfactory way of reconcilingthe oral representations made to him by Mr. Tan and detailed in the Profit Schedule with recognised accounting principles, thereis no mention in his evidence of any inquiry made by him of Mr. Tan to clarify the many problems and resolve obvious contradictionsand difficulties as would befit the approach of a reasonably prudent auditor, nor is there any explanation as to why he failed todo so.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a> The Defendants signed off their Report certifying Extramoney's 1980 Accounts to be true and fair on 8th January 1982.  In view ofthe conclusion which I have reached in answering Question (1), I find that the Defendants were not in a position properly to formsuch a view as to the state of affairs of Extramoney.  The Defendants as reasonably prudent auditors ought to have raised with thecompany's management such queries as would lead them to secure adequate and sufficient supportings to justify including the DisputedProfit in Extramoney's 1980 Accounts, failing which they would have to qualify such Accounts. In my judgment, the Defendants' failureto follow the above course means that they have acted negligently and in breach of their contractual duty towards Extramoney. Additionally,by certifying the group accounts of Holdings which incorporate the 1980 Accounts of its subsidiary Extramoney to be true and fair,the Defendants have likewise acted negligently and in breach of their contractual duty to Holdings.</p>        <p class="heading"><b>RELEVANCE of PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINES</b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a> I turn next to consider the relevance to my decision under Question (2) the views expressed and recommendations laid down by theHong Kong Society of Accountants (âthe HKSA"), being the governing body for accountants practising in Hong Kong, whose <i>statements and Practice Guidelines</i> are accepted by all parties as setting down proper standards of practice for and reasonably capable of being achieved by membersof the profession. As laid down by Woolf J. (as he then was) in <u>Lloyd Cheyham &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Littlejohn &amp; Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20BCLC%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] BCLC 303</a> at 313 c to e, while such <i>statements and Practice Guidelines</i> do not lay down rigid rules, they constitute âvery strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted andunless there is some justification, a departure from this will be regarded as constituting a breach of duty".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a> Two such statements and one <i>Practice Guideline</i> are relevant in the present context. The first is <i>HKSA</i> statement No. 110 which recommends that events which are known to have occurred after the balance sheet date should not normallybe taken into account in preparing accounts unless, inter alia, they assist in forming an opinion as to the amount properly attributable,in the conditions existing on the balance sheet date, to any item the amount of which was subject to uncertainty on that date. Theforegoing provisions are entirely consistent with both experts' agreed views (canvassed by me in the course of answering Question(1)) that it would, as a general rule, be improper and unacceptable for a company to record after the year-end a profit or othertransaction that it had not generated or undergone whether by itself or through an agent during the year in question. Mr. MeocreLi and Mr. Morrison differed on the question whether an exception lay for a company wholly beneficially owned or controlled by agiven individual.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="pseudopara" id="p141">141.</a> The aforesaid controversy begged, of course, the question of proper attribution expressly referred to in <i>statement No. 110</i> by way of exception to the general rule. For all the reasons cited by me in the course determining that controversy, Mr. Tan's decisionin May 1981 to attribute to Extramoney the Disputed Profit generated in the name of Finance in 1980 should not have been taken intoaccount by the Defendants by way of positive indication that the Disputed Profit properly formed part of the trading profits of Extramoneyover the 1980 Period. For the same reasons, neither does it fall within the stated exception to <i>Statement No. 110</i>. Accordingly, the Defendants' certification of Extramoney's and Holdings' 1980 Accounts to be true and fair constituted a breachof the provisions of <i>Statement No. 110</i> and fell to be considered as a breach of duty to their clients the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="pseudopara" id="p142">142.</a> The second relevant statement is <i>HKSA statement No. 118</i> which reminds members that the main object of auditors' working papers is to record and demonstrate the steps which have been takenby the auditors to enable them to form an opinion on the accounts on which they are required to report and provides that, in orderto achieve such object, the working papers should provide, inter alia, evidence of the work carried out by the auditors and schedulesin support of the accounts additional to, or summarising the detail in the client's books. The Profit Schedule prepared by Lai'sassistant is an example of the latter. Evidence of work carried out would include "a record showing queries raised during the auditand their disposal, with notes where appropriate for attention the following year" and "letters of representations i.e. written confirmationby the client of information and opinions expressed in respect of matters such as stock values and amounts of current and contingentliabilities".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="pseudopara" id="p143">143.</a> Clearly, the examples given of matters on which representations are required are not and not intended to be exhaustive. Such a conclusionis reinforced by <i>HKSA Practice Guideline No. 9</i> which recommends that auditors should attempt to obtain all clients' representations in writing. I have earlier nmentioned in thecourse of answering Question (1) that the absence of documentary material evidencing the receipt by the Defendants of oral representationsfrom their lay client Mr. Tan to the effect that the Disputed Profit formed part of the Extramoney's trading profits over the 1980Period demonstrates regrettable non-compliance by the Defendants with the standards of professional practice laid down by the HKSArather than mendacity on Mr. Lai's part in testifying to the receipt of such representations.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="pseudopara" id="p144">144.</a> Indeed, Mr. Lai admitted candidly in cross-examination that while he and his audit team were aware of the above recommendations butthey fell short of following the same. Further, he freely conceded that he should have documented queries he made of the client Mr.Tan but "at the time, as the person ultimately responsible, I haven't considered the point". Clearly, the Defendants have failedto secure in writing Mr. Tan's representations to them as regards Finance's generation of the Disputed Profit for and on behalf ofExtramoney contrary to <i>HKSA statement No. 118</i> and <i>Practice 'Guideline No. 9</i> and, in so doing, have acted in breach of their common law duty of care and contractual duty owed to their clients the Plaintiffs.Put another way, the Defendants' failure to mention in their report such lacunae in the documentary evidence supporting the makingof the Disputed Profit which they say was made good by Mr. Tan's representations constituted a breach of their duty of care owedto the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="pseudopara" id="p145">145.</a> I turn now to consider the relevant statutory provisions governing the scope of the Defendants' duties owed to the Plaintiffs inthe context of this case.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>AUDITORS' STATUTORY DUTIES</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="pseudopara" id="p146">146.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s121.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 121</a></i> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> requires a company to keep proper books of accounts and such books and records as may be necessary to give a true and fair view ofthe company's affairs and to explain its transactions. Given my finding in course of answering Question (1) that the post year-endattribution to Extramoney of the Disputed Profit generated during 1980 in the name of Finance is ineffective in properly renderingthe same the trading profits of Extramoney for the 1980 Period, it is plain that the books and records of Extramoney, incorporatingas they do the Disputed Profit, gives a distorted rather than a true and fair view of Extramoney's affairs over that period.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="pseudopara" id="p147">147.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s123.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 123(1)</a></i> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> stipulates that every balance sheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at the endof its financial year and that every profit and loss account of a company shall give a true and fair view of the profit and lossof the company for the financial year. Again, it is plain that Extramoney's 1980 Balance Sheet, incorporating as it does the DisputedProfit, does not give a true and fair view of the state of Extramoney's affairs as at 31st December 1980. Similarly, Extramoney's1980 Profit and Loss Account, which incorporate the Disputed Profit as if it were a part of the trading profits of the company overthe 1980 Period, does not give a true and fair view of Extramoney's profit and loss for the 1980 Period.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="pseudopara" id="p148">148.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 126</a> (1)</i> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> requires group accounts to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company and the subsidiariesdealt with thereby as a whole. Once more, it is clear that Holdings' 1980 Accounts consolidating the accounts of its various subsidiarieswithin the Carrian Group including the 1980 Accounts of Extramoney (with the Disputed Profit improperly embraced therein as partof Extramoney's profits over the 1980 Period) do not give a true and fair view of Holdings' state of affairs or profit and loss overthat period.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="pseudopara" id="p149">149.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s141.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 141</a> (4)</i> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> <i>(<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>)</i> makes it "the duty of the auditors of a company, in preparing their report under this section, to carry out such investigations aswill enable them to form an opinion as to the following matters, that is to say, --</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a) whether proper books of account have been kept by the company ... ; and</p>            <p style="text-align:justify">(b) whether the company's balance sheet and ... profit and loss account are in agreement with the books of accounts and returns;</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">and if the auditors are of opinion that proper books of account have not been kept by the company ... , or if the balance sheet and... profit and loss account are not in agreement with the books of account and returns, the auditors shall state that fact in theirreport".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p150" class="pseudopara" id="p150">150.</a> The Defendants gave unqualified auditors' reports covering both Extramoney's and Holdings 1980 Accounts. However, in the light ofmy findings in the course of answering Question (1) of, first of all, an almost total absence of an acceptable audit trail amongExtramoney's books and records covering the Disputed Profits (which is not, much ameliorated even by a consideration of the AdditionalMaterial) as contrasted with the existence of an impressive and comprehensive audit trail tracing the generation of Extramoney'sOther Profits and, secondly, that Extramoney's books and records including the Additional Material do not support the theory (asper Mr. Tan's oral representations) of generation of the Disputed Profit by Extramoney wherefor Extramoney's Balance Sheet and Profitand Loss Account for the 1980 Period do not agree with the books, it is plain that the Defendants have either failed to carry outinvestigations as would enable them to form an opinion as to whether proper books of account have been kept by Extramoney and whetherExtramoney's balance sheet and profit and loss account are in agreement with the books or alternatively failed to state that factin their auditors' report. In either event, the Defendants have clearly acted in breach of their aforesaid statutory duty.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p151" class="pseudopara" id="p151">151.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s141.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 141</a> (6)</i> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> provides that "if the auditors fail to obtain all the information and explanations which, to the best of their knowledge and belief,are necessary for the purposes of their audit, they shall state that fact in their report". Clearly, the Defendants in this caseobtained insufficient material in terms of third party documented proof to enable them to verify the Disputed Profit as the tradingprofit of Extramoney over the 1980 Period. The choice then lay upon the Defendants to either qualify their report under <i>subsection (4)</i> or state under <i>subsection (6)</i> that they have been given insufficient material to verify the Disputed Profit as the profit of Extramoney. Having chosen neithercourse but having issued instead clean auditors' reports certifying respectively Extramoney's and Holdings' 1980 Accounts to be trueand fair, the Defendants have clearly acted in breach of their statutory duty.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p152" class="pseudopara" id="p152">152.</a> Since auditors lay under a duty to familiarise themselves with their relevant statutory obligations (per Astbury J. in <u>Re Republic of Bolivia Exploration Syndicate Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%201%20Ch%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) 1 Ch. 139</a>, at 171), the aforesaid breaches of statutory duty by the Defendants constitute also breaches of their common law duty of care andcontractual duty owed to their clients the plaintiffs.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p153" class="pseudopara" id="p153">153.</a> I conclude, therefore, from all of the above that the Defendants have by certifying the 1980 Accounts of Extramoney and Holdingsto be true and fair acted negligently and in breach of their contractual and statutory duties owed to the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>OTHER DEFENCES</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p154" class="pseudopara" id="p154">154.</a> Aside from denying negligence or other breach of duty, a defence which has failed in the light of my answer to Question (2) above,the Defendants also raise in their pleadings issues of estoppel, ratification, contributory negligence and limitation by way of furtheror alternative defences to the Plaintiffs' Principal Claim. I shall consider each of these further issues in turn.</p>        <p class="heading"><u>ESTOPPEL and RATIFICATION</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p155" class="pseudopara" id="p155">155.</a> The estoppel and ratification arguments being interrelated, I shall deal with them in tandem. The Defendants' case is that, in thedischarge of their duties as auditors, they were entitled to and did rely on the documents and representations submitted by Mr. Tanon behalf of the Plaintiffs as being true and correct wherefor the latter are estopped from denying the existence of the DisputedProfit or asserting that there was no such profit attributable to Extramoney. The Defendants say, alternatively, that prior to thesigning of the auditors' report, the share transactions which gave rise to the Disputed Profit were confirmed and ratified by thedirectors of Extramoney. The latter plea is a reference to Extramoneyâs directors Finance and Realty signing the audited BalanceSheet and Profit and Loss Account (incorporating the Disputed Profit as the profit of Extramoney) prior to the Defendants signingoff their auditors' report on 8th January 1982 certifying the 1980 Accounts as being true and fair.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p156" class="pseudopara" id="p156">156.</a> Both the above issues have already been effectively canvassed in the course of my answering Question (2) above. To recapitulate,first of all, I understand both experts as well as Mr. Lai of the partner of the Defendants in charge of the audit of Extramoneyto be ad idem in their view that it would be wholly unacceptable for an auditor to proceed on the say so of a director of a company,albeit the 100% beneficial owner and controller thereof without independent, and preferably documentary, verification. Secondly,legal principles are to the same effect, namely, that an auditor does not discharge his duty by accepting the representations ofthe board or the management of a company without undertaking his own investigations by way of checking the accuracy and reliabilityof those representations: <u>Re Thomas Gerrard &amp; Son Ltd.</u> (supra) at 477E, per Pennycuick J.; <u>Berq Sons &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Adams</u> (supra) at 685 F to 686 B, per Hobhouse J.; <u>Pacific Acceptance Corporation Ltd. v. Forsyth</u> (supra) at 67 F - G, per Moffitt J.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p157" class="pseudopara" id="p157">157.</a> Thirdly, both the expert as well as the non-expert evidence go further in agreeing that one of the matters an auditor has to guardagainst is the natural tendency of the management of a company to rewrite the accounts if such a course entailed fiscal or otheradvantages such that a responsible auditor ought to act as a watchdog to prevent such abuse. Fourthly, as Mr. Lai himself concedes,the fact that Mr. Tan being the 100% beneficial owner and controller of Extramoney is a related party to the transaction, a reasonablycareful auditor would have to approach his representations with extra caution. Fourthly, Mr. Lai specifically accepted in cross-examinationthat, before he could include the Disputed Profit in Extramoney's 1980 Accounts he had to be satisfied of two matters, namely, thatthe Disputed Profit had been made as a matter of fact and that the same was made by Extramoney as opposed to some other person orentity.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p158" class="pseudopara" id="p158">158.</a> Finally, the Defendants' plea of ratification begs, in law, the question as to whether Mr. Tan was at the time of the carrying outof the transactions in question acting for and on behalf of Extramoney: see <i>Bowstead on Agency (15th ed.) Art. 15</i> which provides:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"The only person who has power to ratify an act is the person in whose name or on whose behalf the acts purported to be done, andit is necessary that he should have been in existence at the time when the act was done, and competent at the time and at time ofratification to be the principal of the person doing the act; but it is not necessary that at the time the act was done he was known,either personally or by name to the third party."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p159" class="pseudopara" id="p159">159.</a> Lord Macnaghten laid down a rule to similar effect in <u>Keighley, Maxsted &amp; Co. v. Durant</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%20AC%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) A.C. 240 (HL)</a> at 247:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"It is, I think, a well-established principle in English law that civil obligations are not to be created by, or founded upon, undisclosedintentions."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p160" class="pseudopara" id="p160">160.</a> The above puts paid to any principle of estoppel or ratification operating in the circumstances of this case so as to prevent thePlaintiffs from asserting either the impropriety of including the Disputed Profit as part of the trading profits of Extramoney ornegligence or other breach of duty on the Defendats' part in certifying the Plaintiffsâ 1980 Accounts to be true and fair. Theestoppel and ratification defences therefore fail.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p161" class="pseudopara" id="p161">161.</a> I accept the Defendantsâ legal submission that contributory negligence is available to them as a defence in this case since theirliability in contract vis-a-vis the Plaintiffs is the same as their liability in the tort of negligence independently of the existenceof any contract: see <i>Jackson &amp; Powell</i> <i>on Professional Negligence</i> <i>(3rd ed.) paras. 1-84/5;</i> <u>Forsikrinqssaktieselkapet Vesta v. Butcher</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20All%20ER%20488" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 All ER 488</a> at 507e - 510f, 510f - 511a, per Hobhouse J. upheld by the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%20852" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] A.C. 852</a> per O'Connor L.J. at 860 - 7 and per Neill L.J. at 875F - G.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p162" class="pseudopara" id="p162">162.</a> As to their pleaded case on contributory negligence, the Defendants say that, if any loss flowed from their breach of duty (a matterwhich they deny but which I shall determine in answering the next Question), the same was caused or contributed to by negligenceand/or misrepresentation on the part of the Plaintiffs. The issue raised is closely related to the previous issues of estoppel andratification inasmuch as they share the same factual substratum. The plea of contributory negligence arises from the same fact oforal representations made by Mr. Tan on behalf of the Plaintiffs to Mr. Lai during the course of the audit which, according to theDefendants, misled them into attributing the Disputed Profit to Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a> For the five reasons earlier canvassed in disposing of the estoppel and ratification arguments, this plea must also fail. Additionally,the foundation of the Plaintiffs' complaint is the wrongful inclusion of the Disputed Profit as the trading profits of Extramoney,a matter peculiarly within the expertise of the Defendants qua professional auditors of the company in respect of which they arepaid for their advice rather than a question for laymen like Mr. Tan or the management of Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a> My conclusion is reinforced by the legal principle that auditors who are in breach of duty cannot exculpate themselves by pointingto wrongdoing by directors or the management which might have led to such breach since the latter is just the sort of conduct whichthe auditors have been paid to detect and protect the company from in the first place: see per Lord Alverstone L.C.J. in <u>London oil Storaqe Ltd. v.

Onprinciple, it seems to me that this must be so, as an auditor is engaged for the purpose (among others) of detecting irregularitieson the part of employees, and I do not think he can avoid liability for an established breach of his duty by showing that there hasbeen either malpractice or collusion, or negligence on the part of his employer's servants."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a> The above disposes of the contributory negligence claim against the Defendants.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>LIMITATION</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a> Although limitation was pleaded by way of a defence to the Principal Claim, it was but faintly argued and scarcely touched upon inthis context by Mr. Hamilton in his closing speech, I daresay for the obvious reason that the Defendants' certification of Extramoney's1980 Accounts being the subject of complaint having been made on 8th January 1982 coupled with the writ herein having been issuedon 21st December 1987, the plea that the Principal Claim was somehow statute-barred is difficult, if not impossible, to sustain.Accordingly, I determine the limitation point against the Defendants.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>LOSS and DAMAGE</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a> Given my answers to Questions (1) and (2) above, the Plaintiffs carry nevertheless the burden of proving that loss and damage flowedfrom the Defendants' breach of contractual and other duty, otherwise the action fails: <i>MacGregor on Damages, 15th ed., para. 343.</i></p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>PURPOSES of STATUTORY AUDIT</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a> Before considering the Plaintiffsâ pleaded case on loss and damage and the evidence adduced to establish the same, it is as wellto bear in mind the purposes served and interests protected by the Defendantsâ audit of the 1980 Accounts of Extramoney and Holdings,the very activity the careless execution whereof forms the subject of complaint in these proceedings. As laid down by Lord Oliverin <u>Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605 (HL)</a> at 630 F, the duty of an auditor in carrying out a statutory audit serves twin purposes, namely, "to ensure, so far as possible,that the financial information as to the company's affairs prepared by the directors accurately reflects the company's position inorder, first to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing (by, for instance,declaring dividend out of capital) and secondly, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling themto scrutinise the conduct of the company's affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward or control or remove those towhom that conduct has been confided".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a> The House of Lords rejected in that case the argument; that the statutory audit served any wider purpose of, say, providing informationto persons other than those who were proprietors of the company or concerned in its control and management. As explained by HobhouseJ. in <u>Berq Sons &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Adams</u> (supra) at 676H, the restrictive interpretation placed by the House of Lords on the purpose of the statutory audit imposes "alsoa restriction upon the scope of the duty of care that arose simply from carrying out the statutory audit. The existence of a dutyof care owed to the members of the company added little if anything to the duty to the Company".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a> Thus, Hobhouse J. observed ibid. at 677 C-D that "the duty that arises from the carrying out of the statutory audit, although owedas well to the other persons falling within the scope of the statutory purpose, is in effect equivalent with the duty owed to thecompany itself" and at 677E that "the purpose of the statutory audit is to provide a mechanism to enable those having a proprietaryinterest in the company or being concerned with its management and control to have access to accurate financial information aboutthe company. Provided those persons have that information, the statutory purpose is exhausted."</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p172" class="pseudopara" id="p172">172.</a> As will be seen below, the above principles have far-reaching consequences for auditors acting on the representations of a 100% beneficialowner and controller (such as Mr. Tan) of the company whose accounts are being audited (Extramoney and Holdings) provided the companyis solvent and no fraud or misfeasance has been committed vis-a-vis the company by such owner and controller (the situation in thiscase as I shall detail below).</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>The PLAINTIFFS' PLEADED CASE</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p173" class="pseudopara" id="p173">173.</a> The Plaintiffs' case is that, by negligently failing to raise with the management of Extramoney and Holdings the need to qualifythe 1980 Accounts but by certifying instead that the same gave a true and fair view of the company's and the group's state of affairsand profits when they plainly did not do so, the Defendants caused loss to the Plaintiffs inasmuch as, first of all, tax was assessedand paid on the Disputed Profit when the same was not in fact due and, secondly, the Dividend was declared by Extramoney which was,to the extent of HK$74 million, paid out of the company's capital as opposed to its other Profits.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p174" class="pseudopara" id="p174">174.</a> More specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that, had the Defendants raised with Mr. Tan the need to qualify the accounts of both Extramoneyand Holdings, the management, appreciating the effect within the financial and banking communities of such a qualification, wouldnot have been willing to risk the inevitable reverberations within those communities of a qualification of the accounts of a constituentmember of the Carrian Group consolidated in the accounts of Holdings and would have withdrawn the suggestion that the said profithad been made by Extramoney whereupon no such profit would have been submitted to the Inland Revenue for assessment to tax.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p175" class="pseudopara" id="p175">175.</a> The Plaintiffs further allege that, had the Defendants raised with Mr. Tan the spectre of qualifying the accounts, Extramoney wouldthrough his direction have reversed the payment of at least HK$74 million out of the Dividend paid totalling HK$90 million. Becausethey failed to raise this prospect with the management of Extramoney, the latter is HK$74 million worse off in its contra accountswith Holdings.</p>        <p class="heading"><b><u>The EVIDENCE</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p176" class="pseudopara" id="p176">176.</a> The Plaintiffs never sought to make good the above allegations by calling the one person who could properly have testified to thesame, namely, the 100% owner and controller of both Extramoney and Holdings, Mr. Tan. The latter, as I have already noted in thecourse of answering Questions (1) and (2) above, was notable for his absence at the trial. The only evidence on loss and damage ledby the Plaintiffs came from Mr. Michael Kennedy Brown, a experienced banker formerly with the Standard Chartered Bank in the early1980s being the time of the events in question. He testified that lending banks tend place considerable reliance on the accountsof the borrowing company noting, in particular, such questions as whether the accounts are audited and, secondly, whether the sameare qualified. He makes the common sense point that a qualification on the accounts of the borrowing company would put a lendingbanker on inquiry. If loans were made on the basis of collateral security such as CIL shares, then the lending bank would look principallyto that collateral by way of security. The above is, however, somewhat academic since it goes no way towards establishing the Plaintiffs'pleas.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p177" class="pseudopara" id="p177">177.</a> Both the Plaintiffs are private companies and there is no legal obligation to make their accounts public. Further, as the Plaintiffs'own expert Mr. Meocre Li conceded in cross-examination (in a manner entirely consistent with Hobhouse J. 's observations in <u>Berq Sons &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Adams</u> supra at 677E as to the purposes of the statutory audit and the scope of the auditors' duty thereunder), the statutory requirementsof an audit of a company's accounts are not directed to giving information to bankers and others.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p178" class="pseudopara" id="p178">178.</a> Three salient features of the evidence should be noted. First of all, Mr. Tan was at all material times the 100% beneficial ownerand controller of the Plaintiffs. Unlike the situation in <u>Re Thomas Gerrard &amp; Son Ltd.</u> [1968] ch. 455, there was no minority interests to be taken into account. Borrowing the words of Lord Reid in <u>Tesco v. Nattrass</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] A.C. 153 (HL)</a> at 170F, Mr. Tan is "acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company ... He is an embodimentof the company or, one could say, he hears and speaks through the persona of the company, within his appropriate sphere, and hismind is the mind of the company".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p179" class="pseudopara" id="p179">179.</a> There is no doubting the common sense point, consistent with all the authorities, that "so long as the company is solvent the shareholdersare in substance the company": the controlling shareholder is in essence the company: per Dillon L.J. in <u>Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co. v. Multinational</u> <u>Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20Ch%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] Ch. 258 (CA)</a> at 288G -H.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p180" class="pseudopara" id="p180">180.</a> Secondly, neither Plaintiff was insolvent at any material time of the events under consideration. There were no outside creditors'interests to be taken into account. Indeed, Extramoney was never put in liquidation. So far as concerned Holdings, its subsequentliquidation long after the events in question had nothing to do with either the generation or the attribution of the Disputed Profitor Mr. Tan's represenations and wishes or the Defendants' conduct or other events germane to these proceedings. Further, as Mr. Morrisonsaid in his report, with which observation Mr. Meocre Li agreed in his course of his testimony, "in or around December 1980 Holdingsis likely to have been regarded as financially sound by the financial community and therefore an acceptable debtor for which recoverywould be reasonably assured for balance sheet purposes".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p181" class="pseudopara" id="p181">181.</a> In such a situation, the observations of Street L.J. in <u>Kinsela v. Russell Kinsela Pty. Ltd.</u> (in liquidation)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20722" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 N.S.W.L.R. 722</a> at 730 cited with approval by Dillon L.J. in <u>West Mercia Safetywear Ltd.

One of the issues decided in that case can be summarised as follows: where a solvent company enters intoa transaction (in that case with one of the shareholders) with the knowledge and consent of all the shareholders and directors, allacting honestly, and then becomes insolvent, the liquidator cannot subsequently seek to have the transaction set aside on the groundthat it was a fraud upon the company, or the shareholders, or the companyâs creditors. A similar conclusion was recently reachedby a majority of the civil division of this court in <u>Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co. v. Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20Ch%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] Ch. 258.</a> It was held that in such a case the liquidator cannot maintain an action for negligence or breach of fiduciary duty against the shareholdersor directors in relation to their conduct of the company's affairs: their knowledge of, and consent to, the decisions alleged tohave been taken negligently or in breach of duty were the decisions of the company itself, and - transactions being intra vires thecompany's memorandum - there was no basis for any claim by the liquidator."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p183" class="pseudopara" id="p183">183.</a> Thirdly, no fraud or misfeasance by Mr. Tan vis-a-vis either Extramoney or Holdings is even pleaded, let alone established by evidence.While there may have been a vague subtext of unspecified wrongdoing by Mr. Tan implied or hinted at in the course of the Plaintiffs'presentation of this case, it remains no more than that at the end of the day. There was never any clear case of fraud or misfeasanceadvanced against Mr. Tan in the context of these proceedings, let alone backed up by hard evidence. Indeed, the very subject of complaintin this case being Mr. Tan's post year-end attribution of profits to Extramoney for reasons of group tax efficiency was not and,indeed, could not properly be characterised as a fraud or misfeasance committed by Mr. Tan vis-a-vis either Extramoney or Holdings.The narrowness of the experts' respective eventual opinions on the propriety or efficacy of Mr. Tan's act of ex post facto attributionas well as the substance of those opinions bear this out. Again, this distinguishes the present proceedings from the situation in<u>Re Thomas Gerrard &amp; Son Ltd.</u> (supra) where the managing director had been systematically defrauding the company in question for years, an activity which wentuncompletely undetected year after year by the auditors (who had been paid to detect, among other matters, this very type of wrongdoing)because they innocently, indeed blindly, took the managing director's word for it and believed him to be a man of the highest integrity.In other words, the auditors in that case behaved in a manner wholly unbecoming of a professional watchdog paid to guard and protectthe company and the minority shareholders against such wrongdoing.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p184" class="pseudopara" id="p184">184.</a> There is no controversy that in cases of fraud or misfeasance, very different considerations apply:- see, for example, <i>Bowstead on Agency</i> <i>(15th ed.)</i> Art. 102(2):-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhen any fact or circumstance, material to any transaction, business or matter in respect of which an agent is employed, comesto his knowledge in the course of such employment; and is of such a nature that it is his duty to communicate it to his principa;is deemed to have notice thereof as from the time when he would have received such notice if the agent had performed his duty, andtaken such steps to communucate the fact or circumstance as he ought reasonably to have taken; provided that where an agent is partyor privy to the commission of a fraud upon or misfeasance against his principal, his knowledge of such fraud or misfeasance, andof the facts and circumstances connected therewith, is not imputed to the principal.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p185" class="pseudopara" id="p185">185.</a> Thus, where the management is guilty of a fraud on the company which the auditor negligently failed to detect, the auditor cannotrelieve himself from by liability by arguing that the company had at all material times through its management full knowledge ofall the relevant circumstances wherefor the company must have acquiesced in the management's wrongdoing: see <u>Houqhton v. Nothard</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1928%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1928] AC 1 (HL)</a> , <u>In re Hampshire Land Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch. 743 (CA).</a></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p186" class="pseudopara" id="p186">186.</a> In the present case, at the end of the day, notwithstanding all of Mr. Brown's admissible evidence, I am left with the distinct impressionthat the Plaintiffs' case on loss and damage rests on the dubious foundation of speculation as to what Mr. Tan would or would nothave done had the auditors told him that which he already knew, namely, that the imputation of the Disputed Profit to Extramoneywould not accord with the historical development of events during the 1980 Period. Since Mr. Tan never emerged at trial to give evidencewhether for the Plaintiffs or the Defendants, there was no hard evidence as to what he would or would not have done. In other words,the Plaintiffs have failed to discharge the burden of proving 'that' any loss and damage flowed from the Defendants' negligence orbreach of contractual or other duty.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p187" class="pseudopara" id="p187">187.</a> In the circumstances, the manner in which a similar (though by no means identical) situation was disposed of by the Court in <u>Berq Sons &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Adams</u> (supra) is instructive. This was an action against an insolvent company's former auditors in respect of alleged losses caused tothe company by the auditors' alleged negligence and breach of contractual or duty in relation to the preparation and certificationof the company's audited accounts for a particular year. All the shares in the company were beneficially owned by one person. Theallegations of want of care made against the auditors related to the unqualified auditor's certificate signed in respect of the accountsfor the year ending 31st March 1982. The relevant criticisms made of the 1982 audited accounts were, first, that the accounts shouldhave shown a turnover of approximately Â£2 million instead of a figure over 10 times that size of of Â£23 odd million and secondly,that certain bills for Â£2 odd million included in the "bills receivable" should have been treated as irrecoverable with the resultthat the bills receivable would have been reduced from almost Â£5 million to a little under Â£2 1/2 million, the profit before taxationwould be reduced from a profit of Â£50,000 odd to a loss of over Â£2 1/2 million and the net assets would be reduced from a littleunder a quarter of a million pounds sterling to a deficiency of Â£2 odd million.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p188" class="pseudopara" id="p188">188.</a> In dismissing the plaintiffs' claims, Hobhouse J. held that the auditors were at fault in not qualifying their certificate for uncertaintyin respect of the aforesaid bills, the same constituting a breach of their contract with the company. He also held that whereas theauditors had erred in relying upon the unsupported representations of the 100% owner and controller of the company and, notwithstandingthat they had been confirmed by him in writing, the same remained without support or corroboration and should not have been acceptedas sufficient for the purposes of an unqualified certificate. However, the company was not misled and did not rely on the certificateand it had not been proved that as a matter of causation the fact that the audit certificate on the 1982 accounts was not qualifiedfor uncertainty in respect of the aforesaid 'bills had any relevance to the eventual failure of the company.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p189" class="pseudopara" id="p189">189.</a> It cannot be over-emphasised that the reality of this case is that it is the companies Extramoney and Holdings and not their shareholdersor creditors who are suing the Defendants. Further, Extramoney has never been in liquidation and, so far as concerned Holdings, itwas at all times material to this case a financially solvent company. Additionally, no fraud or misfeasance has been committed byMr. Tan vis-a-vis either Plaintiff. Last but not least, both Plaintiffs were at all times private companies wholly owned and controlledby a single individual, Mr. Tan. The essence of the duty owed by the Defendants qua auditors of Extramoney in relation to the accountsis to provide knowledge of the affairs of the company for use by the management, ultimately, Mr. Tan. It is noteworthy that the ultimatevictim of the Defendants' breach of duty did not give evidence. Being the living embodiment of each Plaintiff, Mr. Tan could notconceal anything from himself or defraud himself. He was not misled by the Defendants' report on the 1980 Accounts of Extramoney.Put another way, there was no evidence to this effect. The one controlling beneficial owner already possessed full knowledge andinformation which it was the purpose of the statutory audit so to provide him.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p190" class="pseudopara" id="p190">190.</a> The Defendants say that Mr. Tan had already given effect to his intention to inject the Disputed Profit into Extramoney prior tothe signing of the auditors' report on 8th January 1982. There is no evidence to show that he would have reversed the injection ifthe Defendants were to have qualified their auditors' report on Extramoney's 1980 Accounts. I do not accept speculations to the contraryto be sufficiently persuasive so as to establish the Plaintiffs' case on loss and  damage. Accordingly, I find that if the Defendantswere riegl1gent or otherwise in breach of duty or contract vis-a-vis the Plaintiffs , such conduct did not give rise to the paymentof profits tax based on the Disputed Profit. Additionally, so far as concerned the payment of the Dividend, the same took place beforethe audit of Extramoney's books by the Defendants so that in no way can such action be traced to the Defendants' conduct.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p191" class="pseudopara" id="p191">191.</a> On the contrary, all the available evidence showed that Mr. Tan was at all material times the sole moving light of the Carrian Groupand each the Plaintiffs who was, to borrow an expression, "calling all the shots" in the running of his various companies ratherthan taking advice from his companies' auditors, wherefor there is no warrant for supposing that the outside advisers' tail was waggingthe particular headstrong corporate dog in the instant case. On the contrary, it is salutary to recall in this particular contextthe Defendants' partner Mr. Lai's evidence in chief that "as far as I was concerned, I was simply taking orders from Mr. Tan" andSuperintendent Starling's notes of his interview of Mr. Lai on 12th June 1984 wherein Mr. Lai observed that Mr. "Tan was a pushyguy".</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p192" class="pseudopara" id="p192">192.</a> I therefore reiterate that the Defendants' negligence and breach of contract have, in my judgment, given rise to no proven loss onthe part of the Plaintiffs. I should" also 'indicate that, for the above reasons, the Defendants' breaches of duty evidenced by non-compliancewith <i>HKSA Statements</i> and <i>Guideline</i> and breaches of statutory duty laid down under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s141.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 141(4)</a> and (6) of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>) gave rise, in my judgment, also to no loss and damage suffered by the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>LATE PAYMENT SURCHARGE</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p193" class="pseudopara" id="p193">193.</a> As to the question of the late payment, surcharge, the audit was completed on 8th April 1981 but the 1980 Accounts only signed offon 8th January 1982.' There was, however, nothing sinister in the delay and no' criticism should befall the Defendants on that account.By an internal memo sent to Mr. John Wong the Group financial controller dated 29th October 1981, Mr. Rod Bell the Group financialdirector, proposed that the submission of Extramoney' s tax returns for the 1980 Accounts should be delayed until after the InlandRevenue had assessed Filomena's tax returns. Thus the delay was deliberately engineered on the part of the Carrian management whereforin no way should the late payment surcharge be visited upon the Defendants.</p>        <p class="heading"><u><b>MITIGATION of LOSS</b></u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p194" class="pseudopara" id="p194">194.</a> In the light of my conclusion on the last Question, no answer is strictly required on this one. However, in the event that I shouldbe wrong in my last answer, I will indicate in brief my views on the present issue.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p195" class="pseudopara" id="p195">195.</a> The Defendants plead that neither Plaintiff has taken any step to recover the Overpaid Profits Tax from the Inland Revenue and, further,that no-one among Extramoney or its corporate shareholders and directors and the three Liquidators of Holdings took any steps torecover the Dividend from Holdings or cause the latter to account as constructive trustee or recover the loss by way of tax or dividendfrom any director, fiduciary or constructive trustee, wherefor Extramoney had failed to mitigate its loss.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p196" class="pseudopara" id="p196">196.</a> The above point was neither argued nor developed fully (nor expressly abandoned) at the trial, I suspect for two reasons. First ofall, the plea that neither Plaintiff has taken any step to recover the Overpaid Profits Tax from the Inland Revenue is in fact incorrectas a matter of fact. The Plaintiffs have in fact applied by their solicitors' letter to the Commissioner dated 31st March 1987 fora refund of the Overpaid Profits Tax alternatively a correction of Extramoney's original assessment to profits tax on the basis thatthe Disputed Profit was not the profit of Extramoney. The Assessor has refused to disturb the original assessment. In or around 9thMarch 1980, the Plaintiffs objected to such refusal but the Commissioner confirmed his previous decision. On or about 3rd January1990, the Plaintiffs appealed to the Board of Review. The date for the hearing of this appeal has not been fixed pending my decisionin these proceedings.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p197" class="pseudopara" id="p197">197.</a> More fundamentally, such a plea is academic in the light of the existence of the Defendants' Counterclaim for declaratory reliefin terms of the Plaintiffs' entitlement to a refund of the Overpaid profits Tax and a reimbursement of so much of the Dividend asis based on the Disputed Profit. The lodging of the Counterclaim, like the application made to the Commissioner and the appeal tothe Board of Review, puts paid to the notion that the Plaintiffs have failed to mitigate their loss. Additionally, the Plaintiffs'failure to mitigate their loss, if such be established at all, would then sound in an award of costs on the Counterclaim in the Defendants'favour if the same were to succeed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The HK$1.2 MILLION PAYMENT</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p198" class="pseudopara" id="p198">198.</a> Question (6) is sub-divided into two parts, namely, whether, first of all, the HK$1.2 million payment to the Defendants by way ofa Holdings' cheque was made by Mr. Tan in breach of trust or fiduciary duty owed to Holdings and secondly, in the event of a positiveanswer to the first part, whether the Defendants became constructive trustees of the same for Holdings. The first issue is one ofmixed law and fact while the second is purely a legal question. I shall consider each in turn.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The EVIDENCE</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p199" class="pseudopara" id="p199">199.</a> The facts emerged in the evidence of Mr. Raymond Chan the precedent partner of the Defendants which I shall summarise below. He testifiedthat in 1980 his stockbroker Mr. Tsang of Hung Fat told him that Mr. Tan was making small private placements of CIL shares at a slightdiscount to the market. The three partners of the Defendant firm, namely, Mr. Chan, Mr. Lai and Mr. Joseph Pang (âthe Three Partners")jointly maintained an account with Hung Fat ("the Three Partners' Account") and authorised Mr. Tsang to operate the same on a discretionarybasis. According to Mr. Chanâs evidence, in the second half of 1980, Mr. Tsang asked Mr. Chan to approach Mr. Tan to see if hecould obtain between, say, 200,000 and half a million CIL shares on private placement for Hung Fat's customers and discretionaryaccounts including that of the Three Partners. This was by no means an unusual request. On the contrary, Mr. Chan testified Mr. Tsanghad made similar requests of him in the past and he had always done his best to comply.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p200" class="pseudopara" id="p200">200.</a> Mr. Chan testified to the usual modus operandi adopted the parties in such circumstances. He would first approach Mr. Tan for theshares. Mr. Tan would invariably indicate that he wanted the Defendants' cheque by way of a performance guarantee for payment ofthe purchase price even though or because he was well aware that there were other customers (with whom he was riot acquainted) ofHung Fat involved in the proposed purchases. Mr. Tan would also indicate that he would not be responsible for contract stamps orbrokerage so that Mr. Tsang would have to prepare contract notes, pay stamp duty and charge the brokerage to the customers or totheir accounts. The price would beÂ· agreed being at a slight discount to market and completion would then be scheduled for a fewdays after the agreement date. Mr. Chan would then notify Mr. Tsang who would thereupon arrange for his customers' cheques to bepaid into the Defendants' account. Upon receipt of all the cheques, Mr. Chan would make out the Defendants' cheque payable to CILor its nominee and deliver the same to Mr. Tan at the latter's office on the scheduled transaction date. Mr. Chan would collect theshare scrip in return and take the same back to his off ice where they would await collection by Mr. Tsang who would then allocatethe same among" his various customers including" the Three Partners.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p201" class="pseudopara" id="p201">201.</a> Mr. Chan next testified to specific events. In the instant case, the Three Partners purchased 328,000 CIL shares on 19th May 1981at HK$8 per share and another 2 million CIL shares on 28th May 1981 at HK$8. 60 per share. The price for this particular purchaseof CIL shares was agreed on 12th May with completion scheduled to take place on 19th May 1981.  On or shortly before 12th May 1981,Mr. Tsang telephoned Mr. Chan to tell him that a group of investors was interested in buying 2.3 million CIL shares and asked thelatter to approach Mr. Tan about the matter. On 12th May, Mr. Chan went to talk to Mr. Tan and agreed a price of HK$8 per share withpayment scheduled seven days afterwards. Mr. Chan called Mr. Tsang from Mr. Tan's office to confirm the acceptability of the priceand the payment terms. Mr. Tsang gave his assent over the telephone. Mr. Tan then suggested that Mr. Chan increase the proposed purchaseto cover a slightly larger batch of 2,328,000 instead of 2.3 million CIL shares on account of the new figure being more auspiciousunder Cantonese numerology. Mr. Chan agreed. The market high for CIL shares on 12th May was HK$8.40, the low being HK$8.20.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p202" class="pseudopara" id="p202">202.</a> Mr. Tsang collected various cheques from his customers covering the proposed purchase of 2,328,000 CIL shares and paid them intothe Defendants' bank account on respectively Saturday 16th and Monday 18th May 1981.  However, by Tuesday 19th May 1981, Mr. Chanwas unsure whether all the cheques had been cleared wherefor he arranged to pay only for the odd amount of 328,000 CIL shares, leavingthe larger portion of 2 million unpaid. On the same day, Mr. Chan took the cheque covering the smaller amount to Mr. Tan's officeand collected the share certificates pertaining to the 328,000 CIL shares.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p203" class="pseudopara" id="p203">203.</a> By 4 p.m. being the close of banking hours on that same day, Mr. Chan was reasonably sure that the cheques given to him by Mr. Tsanghad cleared wherefor he wrote out another cheque for the large amount and made the same payable to Extramoney as instructed by Mr.Tan and took the same to him. It was at that juncture that Mr. Tan told Mr. Chan that the agreed price of HK$8 per share was toolow in the opinion of his family members and that HK$8.60 was a more appropriate price. Mr. Chan said that he was unhappy with sucha sudden change of mind on the part of Mr. Tan whereupon he told Mr. Tan that he did not accept the proposed price revision. Aftersome discussion, Mr. Tan suggested that Mr. Chan give him a further HK$1. 2 million to cover the extra cost of 2 million CIL sharesat the extra 60 cents per share but that in the meantime he would try to persuade his family members to adhere to the original priceand, if he were successful, he would return the difference to Mr. Chan. Documentary evidence was adduced by consent to show thaton 19th May 1981 the market price high for CIL shares was HK$9.05, the low being HK$8.70.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p204" class="pseudopara" id="p204">204.</a> Mr. Chan testified that he returned to his office after the aforesaid discussion with Mr. Tan and there made out a cheque payableto Extramoney for HK$1.2 million but post-dated to 20th May 1981 although he had at the time received no additional funds from Mr.Tsang. He then returned to Mr. Tan's office with the post-dated cheque and told the latter not to cash the cheque until the followingday since he needed to speak to the other customers of Hung Fat.  Meanwhile Mr. Tan said that, armed with the cheque, he would attemptto persuade his family mambers to adhere to the original agreed price. After that conversation, Mr. Chan left with the certificatespertaining to the 2 million CIL shares. Later that same evening Mr. Tsang came round to the Defendants' premises to collect the scrip.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p205" class="pseudopara" id="p205">205.</a> On the following day, namely, 20th May 1981, Mr. Chan telephoned Mr. Tan to ascertain the news in relation to his persuasive effortsvis-a-vis his family members. After some discussion over the telephone, Mr. Tan apparently gave in and told Mr. Chan that he couldobtain a cheque by way of refund from his brother Jonah Tan. Later that same day, Mr. Chan secured at Mr. Tan 's office from JonahTan by way of a refund a Holdings' cheque for HK$1.2 million made payable to the Defendants and dated 20th May 1981, such chequebeing the subject matter of the Subsidiary Claim in this case. Mr. Chan then paid the Holdings cheque into the Defendants' account.Again, documentary evidence was adduced by consent to show that on 20th May 1981, the market high for CIL shares was HK$8. 95, thelow being HK$8.65 and the closing was HK$8.80.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p206" class="pseudopara" id="p206">206.</a> Thereafter nothing more was heard about the cheque until the Defendants conducted an interim audit of Holdings and its subsidiarieslater that year, sometime between August and November 1981. A member of the Defendants' audit team Mr. Samson Leung discovered thatthere was recorded in Holdings' books what was described as a bonus payment of HK$1.2 million made to the Defendants. Since Holdingshad never made any bonus payment to the Defendants, Mr. Chan immediately suspected that this might be the refund payment incorrectlydescribed and, accordingly, asked Mr. Leung to verify how the entry was recorded in Extramoney's books. Mr. Leung duly checked andreported back to Mr. Chan that the same had been recorded as a sale of 2 million CIL shares at HK$8.60 per share. Mr. Chan thereupontelephoned Mr. Bentley Ho to tell him that there has been an incorrect description of the refund and asked him to arrange for a correctionin the books of respectively Extramoney and Holdings. Mr. Ho said that he would see to the matter. Although Mr.Chan was told of thematter by Mr. Leung, he was never shown the entries in question. He only saw the books after mutual discovery herein.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p207" class="pseudopara" id="p207">207.</a> At the trial there was adduced from Extramoney's books and records a transfer voucher designated V. No. J205 dated 20th May 1981crediting Extramoney's current account with Holdings with HK$1. 2 million described as being the "amount refunded by CHL on behalfof Extramoney Ltd. to Chan Lai Pang &amp; Co. due to overpayment of the proceeds on disposal of 2,000,000 CIL shares wrongly borneby CHL as bonus in the accounts, now reversed. 2,000,000. x ($8.60 - $8.00)". There was also adduced in evidence from the books ofHoldings a corresponding transfer voucher designated V. No. J596 and dated 20th May 1981 debiting Holdingsâ current account withExtramoney the amount of HK$1.2 million described as the "amount refunded by CHL on behalf of Extramoney Ltd. to Chan Lai Pang &amp;Co. due to overpayent of the proceeds on disposal of 2,000,000 CIL shares wrongly borne by CHL as bonus in the accounts, now reversed".Both the aforesaid vouchers are initialled to signify approval by âJW", a reference to John Wong, the financial controller of theCarrian Group. Additionally, in Holdings' general ledger L602/9, there can be seen a post year- end entry dated 20th May 1981 forHK$1.2 million described as being the "amount refunded by CHL on behalf of Extramoney Ltd. to Chan Lai Pang &amp; Co. due to overpaymentof the proceeds on disposal of 2,000,000 CIL shares wrongly borne by CHL as bonus in the accounts, now reversed, 2,000,000 x ($8.60- $8)". Finally, there was also adduced in evidence from Extramoney's books and records a photocopy of a cheque for HK$1.2 milliondrawn by Extramoney and payable to Holdings being the refund from Extramoney to Holdings, the latter having made a refund of thelike amount to the Defendants.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p208" class="pseudopara" id="p208">208.</a> Mr. Tsang was declared bankrupt in 1982 and his current whereabouts are unknown. All the Registrar General's records and documentspertaining to Mr. Tsang's bankruptcy were destroyed on 26th September 1990 pursuant to Court Order, a fact among others which engenderedthe Defendants' plea of laches to characterize the want of expedition in the manner in which the Plaintiffs chose to pursue the SubsidiaryClaim, the latter introducing the allegations only by way of a late amendment to the Statement of Claim on 1st November 1991 beingover 10 years after the occurrence of the events in question.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p209" class="pseudopara" id="p209">209.</a> Notwithstanding the want of records from Hung Fat and the absence of Mr. Tsang as a witness to confirm Mr. Chanâs story, I am satisfied,first of all, having seen and heard Mr. Chan testify, secondly, bearing in mind the documentary evidence adduced from Extramoney'sbooks and records hereinabove described to corroborate his testimony and, last but not least, the very nature of the story with itsmany touches of Hong Kong realism, that Mr. Chan was 'telling me the truth. Additionally, there was no positive evidence, whetheroral or documentary, available to support the Plaintiffsâ contrary contentions which remain speculative at best. In conclusionI accept Mr. Chan's evidence as to the HK$1.2 million payment, and conclude, accordingly, that the Defendants do not hold the saidsum as constructive trustees for the Plaintiffs or either of them.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>LACHES and LIMITATION</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p210" class="pseudopara" id="p210">210.</a> In the light of my findings of fact in answering Question (6) above and bearing in mind my foregoing decision notwithstanding theDefendants' inability through lapse of time to subpoena or obtain the records of Hung Fat after the bankruptcy and disappearanceof its proprietor Mr. Tsang in 1982, I propose to express no views on the now academic questions of whether the Subsidiary Claimis in any event time-barred under the Limitations Ordinance or whether I should in the exercise of my discretion decline to adjudicatethe Subsidiary Claim by reason of laches on the part of the Plaintiffs in the prosecution thereof rendering it unfair to allow itto proceed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The HIGH COURT's JURISDICTION to ORDER REFUND of OVERPAID TAX</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p211" class="pseudopara" id="p211">211.</a> Again, in view of my answers to Questions (1) and (4) above, it is not strictly necessary for me to express give a view on Question(7). However, in deference to Counsels' submissions and in the event of my being wrong in my aforesaid answers, I will express myview on this matter and give brief reasons in support.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The ISSUES</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p212" class="pseudopara" id="p212">212.</a> The Counterclaim affects the Commissioner only insofar as the Defendants seek a declaration that the tax and surcharge on the DisputedProfit was properly paid or alternatively, in the event of the Plaintiffs' claim succeeding as against them, that the Plaintiffsare entitled to repayment by the Inland Revenue of the Overpaid Profits Tax. The Commissioner's pleaded position is I have no powerto grant any such delaratory relief since the Board of Review has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the issue of the correctnessof Extramoney's original assessment to tax and hence the question of reimbursement of the profits tax paid. This is an issue of purelaw. At the hearing before me, Mr. Andrews for the Commissioner submitted, additionally, that in the event of my deciding in theDefendants' favour on the question of jurisdiction, I should should nevertheless decline the relief sought in the exercise of mydiscretion. I shall deal with the two issues in that order.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>JURISDICTION</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p213" class="pseudopara" id="p213">213.</a> The factual background against which legal submissions were made is uncontroversial. On or around 9th January 1982, Extramoney furnishedtax returns for the 1980 Period disclosing assessable profits amounting to HK$132,881,885 and represented by the Defendants' unqualifiedreport (qua auditors) attached to the audited 1980 Accounts that the same gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Extramoneyat 31st December 1980. Extramoney was assessed to tax on such profits and, on or about 25th March 1982, Holdings remitted the taxtogether with a 5% surcharge for late payment. Some five years later, in or around 31st March 1987, Extramoney claimed that, of theprofits tax previously paid, HK$17, 617,556 were not properly chargeable. The Assessor refused to correct the assessment. In or around9th March 1989, the Plaintiffs objected to such refusal but the Commissioner confirmed his previous decision. On or about 3rd January1990, the Plaintiffs appealed to the Board of Review. No date has been fixed for the hearing of that appeal pending my present decision.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p214" class="pseudopara" id="p214">214.</a> The Commissionerâs case is that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/112" class="autolink_findacts">Inland Revenue Ordinance</a> ("the IRO") establishes a self-contained code for the assessment, determination and collection of a charge to profits tax and fordeciding all claims and challenges thereto. Additionally, the IRO has created statutory persons to determine disputes arising outof an assessment to tax and including, in particular, the Board of Review to adjudicate exclusively on those matters properly broughtbefore it on appeal. I shall now summarise the statutory scheme.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The statutory Scheme</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p215" class="pseudopara" id="p215">215.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/112/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 14</a></i> of the <i>IRO</i> is a mandatory provision requiring profits tax to be charged in respect of assessable profits from a trade or business in Hong Kong.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p216" class="pseudopara" id="p216">216.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/112/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 64</a></i> states that any person aggrieved by an assessment may, by written notice to the Commissioner setting out grounds, object to thatassessment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p217" class="pseudopara" id="p217">217.</a> <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/112/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66</a></i> confers a right upon the aggrieved person, in the event of the Commissioner failing to agree with his objection, to appeal to theBoard of Review.

If the taxpayer's objection is not upheld by the Commissioner, hisonly recourse under the statute is to lodge an appeal with the Board of Review. Save only where an appeal is transferred to the HighCourt under the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/112/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66</a> or if there is an appeal from the Board of Review's own decision by way of case stated on a point of law only does the High Courtinvolved in the adjudicatory process. No power is independently conferred upon the High Court to determine the correctness or otherwiseof an assessment to tax on questons both of fact and of law. Put another way, the High Court is not made a primary fact-finding tribunalfor the purposes of determining the correctness of tax assessments.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p224" class="pseudopara" id="p224">224.</a> The use of the expressions "final" and "final and conclusive" in the statute to characterise the decisions of the Board of Reviewis also telling. The legislative intent is plain that the Board should adjudicate finally on all matters of fact properly broughtbefore it. The above statutory provisions have the effect, in my judgment, of establishing in the IBO a comprehensive code for decidingall disputes arising from a tax assessment, conferring in the process exclusive primary jurisdiction upon the Board of Review todetermine such disputes on the facts.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Declaratory Relief</u></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p225" class="pseudopara" id="p225">225.</a> How ought the Defendantsâ claims for declaratory relief be dealt with? I have no doubt, following my detemination on the jurisdictionalquestion against the Defendants, that their prayers for the alternative declarations hereinabove defined should be dismissed. Ifthe High Court has no primary jurisdiction to determine a liability to tax, then it must follow that it has no jurisdiction to makedeclarations with regard thereto: see, for example, <u>Barraclouqh v. Brown</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] A.C. 615 (HL)</a>, an authority for the proposition that the grant of declaratory relief in the exercise of the Court's discretion is dependant uponthe existence of a right to a remedy: see per Lord Herschel ibid at 620. The House of Lords held in that case that, where a statutegave a right to recover expenses in a court of summary jurisdiction from a person who is not othewise liable, there is no right tocome to the High Court for a declaration that the applicant has a right to recover the expenses in a court of summary jurisdiction:he can only take proceedings in the latter court.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p226" class="pseudopara" id="p226">226.</a> I draw comfort in my conclusions from the following remarks of Lord Diplock in <u>Re Vandervell's Trusts</u> [1971] A.C. (HL) at 943H and 944G upon considering the effect of similar (though by no means identical) provisions in the U.K. IncomeTax Management Act 1964:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"The decisive question, as I see it, is whether the court has any jurisdiction, after an assessment to surtax has once been made,to adjudicate between the taxpayer and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue upon the correctness of the assessment or upon any underlyingissue of fact on which the correctness of the assessment depends, where the board have no other interest in that issue except itseffect upon the taxpayer's liability to surtax.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"I think the court has no such jurisdiction. The provisions of section 5 (6) of the Income Tax Management Act 1964, which I citedat the outset of my speech, are clear and unequivocal. The power to alter an assessment once it has been made and served is conferredupon the special commissioners to the exclusion of any court of law, except in so far as an appeal from a determination of the specialcommissioners upon a point of law lies to the High Court under section 64 of the Income Tax Act 1952. It is not suggested that thecourt has any jurisdiction to entertain an action between the taxpayer and the board for a declaration that the taxpayer's liabilityto surtax ins different from that with which he is charged by the assessment. That would be to trespass upon the jurisdiction toalter an assessment which Parliament has confided exclusively to the special commissioners. And I do not think that this statutoryexclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court can be circumvented by seeking a declaration upon an issue whether of fact or ofixed fact and law upon which the liability of the taxpayer to the amount of surtax with which he has been charged by the assessmentdepends. If the only interest of the board in that issue is the taxpayer's liability to surtax, any relief granted by the court byway of declaration would either not be a declaration of any rights to which the taxpayer was entitled against the board or vice versa,or would be a declaration of his liability to surtax, and this lies within exluded jurisdictional field.</p>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"If the court has no jurisdiction to grant relief by way of a declaratory judgment of this kind against the board at the suit of thetaxpayer or judgment of this kind against the board at the suit of the taxpayer or against the taxpayer at the suit of the board,it cannot, in my view, acquire jurisdiction to do so merely because a declaratory judgment in similar terms is sought by one or otherparty in an existing action instituted for some other purpose between the taxpayer and some ether person. It follows that if thecommissioners were made parties to the instant action neither the executors nor the board would be entitled to claim any relief byway of declaration or otherwise against one another in that action. A party to an action must be a person who claims in that actionsome relief against another party to the action or against whom some relief is claimed by another party to the action. There is,in my view, no jurisdiction to add as a party to an existing action a person by and against whom no relief which the court has jurisdictionto grant can be claimed."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p227" class="pseudopara" id="p227">227.</a> I turn now to consider the question of discretion.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>DISCRETION</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p228" class="pseudopara" id="p228">228.</a> If I were wrong in my determination of the question of jurisdiction such that I do have power to grant the declartatory relief sought,how ought I to exercise my discretion?  The following three factors militate against the exercise of my discretion (assuming thatI have any) to grant the declaratory relief sought by the Defendants.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p229" class="pseudopara" id="p229">229.</a> First of all, the declarations sought by the Defendants are not supported by any claim of right vis-a-vis the Commissioner.  Putanother way, the parties are agreed that the Defendants do not qualify as "a person aggrieved" within the meaning of section 64 ofthe IRO wherefor they do not fall within the statutory scheme at all. The person or entity who does so qualify is Extramoney whichhas, accordingly, exclusive pessession of the statutory remedy to recover any tax overpaid. Whether or not the Overpaid Profits Taxwere properly paid by Extramoney and whether they are entitled to repayment of the same are issues properly before the Beard of Reviewby way of appeal from the assessor's refusal to correct the original assessment.  Whatever be the outcome of that appeal, the Defendantshave no right to recover the Overpaid Profits Tax as such.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p230" class="pseudopara" id="p230">230.</a> For the same reason, they have and can have no specific remedy operating in personam vis-a-vis the Commissioner. Thus it would notappear that any specific purpose is served by either declaratory relief save by way of an ineffective attempt to bind the Board ofReview in its pending appeal. I say ineffective since the Board of Review is not, of course, a party to these proceedings and forone other more fundamental reason mentioned below. And if no practical utility arises from the grant of a declaratory relief, thesame will refused in the exercise of the Court's discretion: per Lord Watson in <u>Barraclough v. Brown</u>(supra) at 622.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p231" class="pseudopara" id="p231">231.</a> Secondly and more importantly, I am not currently in a position to grant either but, in particular, the second declaration sought.The granting of such relief is dependent on more than a finding of fact that the Disputed Profit formed no part of the trading profitsof Extramoney over the 1980 Period. Such a declaration can only be properly made upon a determination on both law and fact that thetax charged was "excessive by reason of an error or omission in any return or statement ... or of any arithmetical error or omissionin the calculation of the amount of the profits assessed" within the meaning of section <i>70A</i> of the <i>IRO</i>. These are issues in the appeal fairly raised before the Board of Review but which have not been either fully or comprehensivelycanvassed at this trial.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p232" class="pseudopara" id="p232">232.</a> If Extramoney deliberately chose to attribute the Disputed Profit to itself so as to secure fiscal advantages for the Carrian Group,then it is a moot point whether the same fell to be considered an error or omission within the meaning of the section so as to entitleExtramoney to claim a repayment of the Overpaid Profits Tax. There is much relevant case law on the point (see, for example, <u>Sun Yau Investment co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20HKTC%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 H.K.T.C. 17</a>, 21 per Mantell J.; <u>Carrimore Six Wheelers Ltd. v.

Accordingly, the Board is empowered to admit or reject any evidence adduced,whether in an oral or documentary form, including this Judgment which I apprehend will be placed before them if ever the appeal shouldbe heard.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>CONCLUSIONS</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p234" class="pseudopara" id="p234">234.</a> I decline for want of jurisdiction to grant either of the declaratory relief sought the Defendants to bind the Commissioner. WereI wrong in my determination on want of jurisdicition, I would, in any event bearing in mind all the circumstances of this case, exercisemy discretion against granting the declaratory relief.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>COUNTERCLAIM aqainst the PLAINTIFFS I the LIQUIDATORS and the CORPORATE DEFENDANTS</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p235" class="pseudopara" id="p235">235.</a> Similarly, in view of my answer to Question (4) above, it is strictly unnecessary for me to express a view on Question (8). In theevent, however, of my being wrong in my aforesaid answer, my views as regards the Counterclaim mounted against, first of all, thePlaintiffs, secondly, Extramoney's shareholders and directors (respectively Finance, Realty and Joint Venture) and, finally, theLiquidators, are set out below. I shall consider each of the above listed sets of defendants to the Counterclaim in turn.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>COUNTERCLAIM aqainst the PLAINTIFFS</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p236" class="pseudopara" id="p236">236.</a> In the event of my being wrong in holding that the Defendants' breach of duty did not cause the payment of the Overpaid Profits Tax,the Defendants counterclaim for an order that the Plaintiffs prosecute with due diligence an appeal from the assessor's refusal tocorrect his original assessment of Extramoney's tax liability to the Board of Review, alternatively for declaratory relief that,upon payment to the Plaintiffs of any sum which I may order them to pay in this action, they be subrogated to the rights of the Plaintiffsin pursuing the said appeal and be entitled to all refunds of tax and surcharge.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p237" class="pseudopara" id="p237">237.</a> This part of the Counterclaim suffers from none of the problems that plagued the Defendants' claim for declaratory relief to bindthe Commissioner. Accordingly, if the Defendants' breach gave rise to overpayment of the profits tax on the part of the Plaintiffs,I would grant the declaratory relief as claimed against the latter. I turn now to consider the Counterclaim against Holdings, Extramoneyâsshareholders and directors, and the Liquidators.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>COUNTERCLAIM aqainst the 2nd PLAINTIFF, EXTRAMONEY's SHAREHOLDERS and DIRECTORS and the LIQUIDATORS</u></b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p238" class="pseudopara" id="p238">238.</a> The Defendants say that since each of Extramoney' s shareholders (namely, Finance and Realty) and directors (namely, Finance, Realtyand Joint Venture) as well as its ultimate holding company Holdings were 100% beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. Tan, the latter'sknowledge is to be imputed to them such that, if the Defendants' negligence and breach of contractual and statutory duties led tothe payment of the Dividend out of the capital as opposed to the Other Profits of Extramoney, they were all fully aware of such factas well as the additional fact that, the same constituted a breach of fiduciary duty owed to Extramoney. In the circumstances, Holdingsreceived the Dividend as a constructive trustee and, insofar as Finance, Realty and Joint Venture knowingly assisted in the transferof the Dividend to Holdings, each of them became likewise a contructive trustee of the same.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p239" class="pseudopara" id="p239">239.</a> By similar reasoning, the Liquidators are joined as defendants to the Counterclaim since, according to the Defendants, they controlHoldings and its aforesaid subsidiaries and have caused none of them to account for or disgorge the dividend paid out by Extramoney.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p240" class="pseudopara" id="p240">240.</a> The positions occupied in equity by respectively Holdings and each of Extramoneyâs aforesaid shareholders and directors with respectto the receipt and the retaining of the Dividend currently in the hands of the Liquidators are encapsulated by the following observationsof Mil1ett J. in <u>Agip</u> <u>(Africa) Ltd. v.

The first category of 'knowing receipt or dealing' is described in <i>Snell, Ope cit. at p. 194</i> as follows : 'A person receiving property which is subect to a trust ... becomes a constructive trustee if he falls within eitherof two heards, namely : (i) that he received trust property with actual or constructive notice that it was trust property and thatthe transfer to him was a breach of trust; or (ii) that although he received it without notice of the trust, he was not a bona fidepurchaser for value without notice of the trust, he dealt with the property in a manner inconsistent with the trust.'  I admit todoubt as to whether the bounds of this category might not be drawn too narrowly in Snell. For example, why should a person who, havingreceived trust property knowing it to be such but without notice of a breach of trust because there was none, subsequently dealswithin the property in a manner inconsistent with the trust not be a constructive trustee within the 'knowing receipt or dealingcategory.'</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"I respectfully agree.
