At all the material times, the Plaintiff was theoccupier of the 3/F Flat and she lived in the premises with her husband and two dogs.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Since April 2008, the Defendant has been the registered owner of Apartment B, Upper and Lower Level of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of the Somerset (âthe 4/F Flatâ) which is directly above the 3/F Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Plaintiff brings this action under (a) nuisance; (b) negligence and (c) breach of the Deed of Mutual Covenant. She claims thatbecause of water leakage from the 4/F Flat to the 3/F Flat, damages were caused to the living room, the master bedroom, the studyroom, the storeroom and the wardrobe installed in the bedroom of the 3/F Flat. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  At trial, the Defendant was absent but the records showed that the Defendant had been duly notified of the trial date and had beenduly served with all the relevant papers. I therefore directed that the trial should proceed in the absence of the Defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Evidence</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(1) <u>The Water Seepage</u></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff told the Court that although the Defendant had given notice to the buildingâs management office, the Somerset ManagementOffice (âSMOâ), that renovation work would commence on 8 July 2008 at the 4/F Flat, in June 2008, she started noticing a lotof drilling noise as well as banging and hammering sounds, which emanated from above. She said that she often could not hear herselfwhen talking on the telephone and she had to step out from the 3/F Flat in order to talk on the phone. She also said that, sometimes,she could even feel some vibration.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 25 June 2008, while the Plaintiff was at home waiting for a friend, she said she discovered some water marks on the ceiling ofthe living room of the 3/F Flat. The Plaintiff also noticed that water was dripping from above and various parts of her propertywere affected. As a result, she had to place buckets and cloth/towel on the floor to absorb the water dripped from the ceiling. ThePlaintiff said, in view of what happened, she immediately notified the security guard of the building and the staff of SMO.  </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  According to the Plaintiff, she was later informed by the staff of SMO that an inspection was subsequently conducted at the 4/FFlat in the presence of a representative of the Defendant. It was found that water had accumulated on the balcony floor and the livingroom floor of the 4/F Flat. She was also told that following the inspection, SMO had issued a letter to the Defendant, recordingthe incident and requiring necessary work to be carried out.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff told the Court that the situation, however, did not improve. In total, she had made 4 complaints to SMO between 25June 2008 and 16 August 2008 about various water seepage problems originated from the 4/F Flat. The first complaint she made on 25June 2008 was the one outlined above.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Then, on 9 July 2008, the Plaintiff made the second complaint and that was in relation to water seepage and water dripping at theceiling of the master bedroom. Again, she notified the staff of SMO and inspection of the 4/F Flat was carried out later that dayby the staff of SMO in the presence of a representative of the Defendant. During the inspection, it was found that water had againaccumulated on the balcony floor of the 4/F Flat. A letter recording the incident and requiring necessary action to be done was againsent by SMO to the Defendant. On this occasion, some photographs were taken of the 3/F Flat by the staff of SMO.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 10 July 2008, the Plaintiff found that there was water seepage at the ceilings of the living room, the master bedroom, the storeroom,and the study room. Bedding and some of the Plaintiffâs belongings were damaged and the same had to be removed in order to avoidfurther damage. In addition, the Plaintiff said she discovered cracks on various parts of the ceilings of the living room and themaster bedroom. The staff of SMO informed the Plaintiff that, on that day, workers damaged the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat whencarrying out the renovation work, which then led to the accumulation of water on the floor. During the inspection of the 4/F Flatand the 3/F Flat carried out on that day, the staff of SMO took some photographs for the record and also issued another letter tothe Defendant recording the incident. Owing to the water seepage problem and for safety reasons, the Plaintiff engaged a contractorto inspect the 3/F Flat on 15 July 2008. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 16 August 2008, the Plaintiff again found water seepage at the master bedroom ceiling. However, as the Defendant or its representative/agentcould not be located there and then, no inspection of the 4/F Flat was carried out on that day. Subsequently, on 18 August 2008,the staff of SMO visited the 4/F Flat and found water seeping from the flush water supply pipe of the unit. Workers at the 4/F Flatthen conducted repair work but were unsuccessful. The repair work was subsequently completed on 19 August 2008. Later on, a letterwas sent by SMO to the Defendant recording the incident and urging the Defendant to exercise proper care when carrying out the renovationwork. On 20 August 2008, the Plaintiff again engaged a contractor to examine the water seepage problem in the master bedroom butwas told that as the water came from above, there was nothing that she could do.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 15 July 2008, the Plaintiff instructed her solicitors to issue a letter to the Defendant, notifying the Defendant of the relevantwater seepage incidents and requiring remedial work to be carried out. A similar letter was also sent on 16 August 2008. These lettersand the letters sent by SMO to the Defendant mentioned above were produced at trial. Further, the Plaintiff said that even afterthe Writ of Summons in this action had been issued, the situation did not improve. On 23 September 2008, she discovered that thecanvas covering the scaffolding of the 4/F Flat fell onto the air-conditioning units of the 3/F Flat and she noticed water marksreappearing at the ceilings and the walls of the 3/F Flat, including the storeroom.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(2) <u>The Expert Opinion</u></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr. Lee Kwok Chuen, a chartered building surveyor instructed by the Plaintiff, testified at trial. Mr. Lee told the Court that hehas had 10 yearsâ experience in conducting and supervising water leakage repair work. He said that he carried out an inspectionof the 3/F Flat on 3 November 2008. It was a visual inspection but a moisture meter was used to record the condition of the wallsand the ceilings. His findings during the inspection were as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the ceilings of the study room and the master bedroom were noted to have higher than normal moisture levels with readings of20 and 18 respectively. The normal range should be between 6 and 16;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) a hairline crack, which is a thin line crack, was noted at the ceiling of the living room;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  signs of dampness and hairline cracks were noted at the ceiling of the master bedroom;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) signs of water leakage were noted at the window-frame and the hinge of the master bathroom;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e)  signs of dampness were noted at the ceiling of the study room;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f)   signs of dampness and a hairline crack were noted at the false ceiling of the study room;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(g)  signs of dampness and peeling off of the paint were noted at the ceiling of the storeroom inside the study room;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(h)  signs of dampness were noted at the ceiling of the bedroom; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)    brown stains were noted at the top inner surface of the wardrobe immediately below the ceiling of the bedroom.   </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Lee commented that as most of the signs of dampness were found not close to the external wall, it would be remote that the waterseepage was due to external weather. Moreover, as signs of dampness were mostly found at the ceilings, the most probable cause ofthe water seepage would be the accumulation of water on the floor of the 4/F Flat. Mr. Lee said that according to the staff of SMO,all the windows of the 4/F Flat had been removed during the renovation. He said that, therefore, during rainy days, there were nowindows to stop the rainwater from coming in. When the rain was heavy, rainwater would accumulate. Since there would not be any drainpoints in the living room and the drain in the balcony might not be able to drain off the rainwater properly, the water thus accumulatedon the floor would then seep into the ceiling of the premises downstairs. In addition, as there was bursting of the flush water pipein the 4/F Flat on two occasions, water would accumulate on the floor of the master bedroom and the master bathroom of the 4/F Flat,which would then seep into the ceiling of the master bedroom of the 3/F Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr. Lee added that since the hairline cracks were found near the signs of dampness, it was likely that the cracks were caused bythe water seepage from the upper floor unit, not because of normal wear and tear.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  After examining the affected areas in the 3/F Flat, Mr. Lee estimated that the repair cost would be HK$68,500 which would includethe replacement of the wardrobe in the bedroom. Mr. Lee explained that since the wardrobe is made of wood and is built up to theceiling, the whole wardrobe would have to be replaced for the sake of giving a consistent look and in order to avoid the formationof mould caused by the seepage of water.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Findings</b></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I find both the Plaintiff and Mr. Lee to be honest witnesses. I have no doubt that between June and August 2008, the Plaintiff noticedwater seepage/dripping in the 3/F Flat and that she had made a total of 4 complaints to the staff of SMO. I also accept that on thefirst two occasions (25 June 2008 and 9 July 2008), water was found to have accumulated on the floor of the 4/F Flat whereas on thelast two occasions (10 July 2008 and 16 August 2008), the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat was damaged and there was water on thefloor. Such accumulation of water caused the water seepage/dripping problems in the 3/F Flat.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Nuisance</b></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  For the Plaintiff to succeed in this cause of action, the Plaintiff has to prove on the balance of probabilities that the wateroriginated from the 4/F Flat and that the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge about this [see <i>å¼µç§ç²åå¦ä¸äºº</i> <i>å°</i> <i>é­ç¦®è</i> CACV No. 268/1998, unrep. (9 April 1999)].</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On the evidence before me, I have no doubt that the accumulation of water on the floor of the 4/F Flat caused the water seepageproblems in the 3/F Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On the first two occasions, the reason for the accumulation was probably due to rainwater coming into the 4/F Flat during heavyrainfalls. The photographs and documents included in the bundle showed that window alteration work was carried out at the livingroom, the bedrooms and the balcony of the 4/F Flat during the renovation. When the windows were removed and when there was inadequatefloor drain, rainwater would accumulate on the floor as observed by the staff of SMO. On the last two occasions, it is clear thatwater accumulated on the floor as a result of the bursting of the flush water supply pipe in the 4/F Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I find that the Defendant must have been aware of the water seepage problem shortly after the Plaintiff made the first complainton 25 June 2008. This complaint was made known to the Defendant or its agent and it then led to the inspection of the 4/F Flat bythe staff of SMO in the presence of the Defendantâs representative. It is, however, clear that despite the Defendantâs knowledgeabout the water seepage problem and despite the warning letter from SMO, no, or no proper, action was taken to prevent the seepageor to address the problem of accumulation of water in the 4/F Flat because water was again found to have been accumulated on thebalcony floor of the 4/F Flat when the Plaintiff noticed, for the second time, water seepage problem on 9 July 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In respect of the accumulation of water due to the bursting of the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat, I find that shortly after thePlaintiff made the third complaint on 10 July 2008, the Defendant must have been aware of the fact that its renovation workers haddamaged the pipe. In fact, according to the staff of SMO, it was at the request of the representative of the Defendant that the supplyof flush water was suspended for all apartments B on 10 July 2008. However, despite this incident and the warning letter from SMO,the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat was again damaged around 16 August 2008 for the Plaintiff again noticed water seepage at theceiling of the master bathroom in the morning of 16 August 2008. As a result, she made the fourth complaint. This time, despite theefforts made to contact the Defendant or its agent/representative and despite the leaving of messages by the staff of SMO, the Defendantâsrepresentative only turned up that night about 12 hours after the complaint had been made by the Plaintiff. Repair work of the pipewas carried out on 18 August 2008 and was completed on 19 August 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Para. 20-53 at page 1191 of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (19<sup>th</sup> ed.) reads,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>â<b>Nuisance created by independent contractor</b> Whether a person can be said to be a wrongdoer if the nuisance is created by his independent contractor depends on whether he couldreasonably have foreseen that the work he had instructed the independent contractor to do was likely to result in a nuisance.  InBower v Peate, Cockburn C.J. said :</i></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left"><i>âA man who orders work to be executed from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences to his neighbour mustbe expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented, is bound to see to the doing of thatwhich is necessary to prevent the mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing someone else â whetherit be the contractor employed to do the work from which the danger arises or some independent person â to do what is necessaryto prevent the act he has ordered to be done from becoming wrongful.â  </i>    </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In the present case, when the Defendant ordered window alteration work to be carried out in the 4/F Flat, the Defendant could reasonablyhave foreseen that with the removal of windows, and at times of heavy rainfalls, rainwater could easily enter the premises and couldeasily accumulate on the floor which could then cause water seepage problem. At the very least, the Defendant must have foreseenthe problem after it had been notified of the Plaintiffâs complaint made on 25 June 2008. However, no, or no proper, preventivemeasures were taken and water accumulation was again found on 9 July 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Similarly, after the Defendant had been notified of the bursting of the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat and the water seepage problemin the 3/F Flat on 10 July 2008, it could reasonably have foreseen that if the pipe was not handled properly or with care and attention,it could burst easily and could lead to water seepage problem. However, despite the incident on 10 July 2008, damage was again causedto the flush water pipe in the 4/F Flat on 16 August 2008, on which day the Plaintiff again noticed water seepage at the ceilingof the master bedroom. This showed that the Defendant either did not pay attention to the problem or did not adopt any proper meansto prevent the problem from recurring.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  All in all, I find that nuisance has been proved against the Defendant in this case. The water seepage/dripping problems found inthe 3/F Flat were caused by the accumulation of water on the floor of the 4/F Flat and the bursting of the flush water pipe thereinduring the relevant times. As set out above, the Defendant, being the owner of the 4/F Flat, must have known of these problems throughthe notifications given by SMO. The fact that an independent contractor had been employed to undertake the renovation work does notabsolve the Defendant from liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Negligence</b></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Given the reasons above, I also find that the Defendant was negligent when carrying out the renovation work in the 4/F Flat, thuscausing the water seepage/dripping problems in the 3/F Flat.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Breach of the DMC</b> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Clause 22 and Clauses 4 to 6(a) of the Second Schedule of the Deed of Mutual Covenant of the Somerset stipulate that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<i>22.  <u>Each Owner may place in his own Unit at his own expense any additions, improvements, fixtures, fittings and decoration</u> Provided the same may be installed fixed and removed <u>without structural damage to or interference with the enjoyment of the Buildings or any part(s) thereof</u> or any of the services apparatus and equipment of the Buildings and each such Owner shall have the right to remove the same at hisown expense Provided Always that such internal alteration, additions and improvements shall comply with all Government regulationsand ordinances.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>4.  <u>To keep the interior of each Unit</u> of which he is for the time being the Owner and all electrical and sanitary appliances and other services therein <u>in good repair and condition and to maintain the same in a manner so as to avoid any loss, damage, nuisance or annoyance to the Owneror occupier of any other portion(s) in the Buildings</u>.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote"><i>5.

I allow these claims accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In respect of the surveyorâs fees set out in item (3), I consider that this should more appropriately be dealt with as part ofthe costs of this action, rather than as damages suffered by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Insofar as item (4), the costs of alternative accommodation, is concerned, I am not prepared to allow the claimed amount in full.This sum is for renting an apartment of around 2,500 sq. ft. in the same district as that of the 3/F Flat for 1Â½ months. The Plaintiffsaid that this period would have taken into account the time required for the removal of furniture before the commencement of therepair work and the return of the furniture afterwards as the expertâs estimate of 1 month had not yet included such time.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  While I accept that one would require time to do the packing and unpacking, such work would probably need to be carried out by thePlaintiff in the premises. I am therefore not convinced that alternative accommodation would be required during these periods. Inthe normal course of events, once packing is done, it would probably take just one day, or at most two, for the moving out of thefurniture. For the return of the furniture, probably the same number of days would be required. Since the expertâs assessment wasthat it would only take about 1 month to have the repair work done, a few days on top of this estimate should not lead to 1Â½ months.Therefore, concerning the period during which alternative accommodation would be required, I am only prepared to allow one month.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I shall now move on to consider the costs of the alternative accommodation. It was the Plaintiffâs evidence that although the3/F Flat is of an area of 3,099 sq. ft., she lives there with her husband and two dogs only. The Plaintiff said that since she hastwo large dogs, she would probably not be able to find alternative accommodation in a hotel. Her choices would therefore be limited.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  While I accept that it might not be feasible for the Plaintiff to seek alternative accommodation in a hotel because of her two largedogs, I do not consider it reasonable to seek alternative accommodation in an apartment of the size of 2,500 sq. ft., which is whatthe Plaintiff now asks for. In this case, we are only talking about providing a temporary accommodation for two adults and two dogs.It is understandable that the Plaintiff might be used to a very spacious living environment as the 3/F Flat is of a large size. However,when one seeks alternative accommodation which is temporary in nature, one could not say that an apartment, which is, say, of 1,500sq. ft. would be an unreasonable choice for 2 adults and 2 dogs or would be too unacceptable even though the family is used to livein a 3,000 sq. ft. apartment.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  From the documents provided by the Plaintiff, it is noted that to rent an apartment of about 1,500 sq. ft. in the district in whichthe 3/F Flat is located, it would cost between HK$36,000 and HK$80,000 for a month. Since I find that the reasonable duration duringwhich alternative accommodation would be required is about one month, and since I find that an apartment of about 1,500 sq. ft. wouldbe reasonable alternative accommodation in the Plaintiffâs case, I am prepared to allow a sum of HK$60,000 as the costs of alternativeaccommodation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  For the reasons set out above, the Plaintiff succeeds in this action and I give judgment in favour of the Plaintiff to recover lossand damages in the total amount of HK$135,500, with interest thereon at the judgment rate from the date of the writ until payment.The break-down of the sum of HK$135,500 is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  HK$7,000 as the costs incurred for conducting emergency inspections of the 3/F Flat;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  HK$68,500 as repair costs; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  HK$60,000 as the costs to seek alternative accommodation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I also make an order nisi that the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiffâs costs in this action, to be taxed if not agreed, with acertificate for one counsel. If no application is made within 14 days from the date of this judgment to vary the order, the costsorder nisi shall become absolute. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Anthea Pang)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr. Felix Hoe and Ms. Shrina Daswani, instructed by Messrs Li, Wong, Lam &amp; W.
