From the 11th floorupwards the building is for domestic use. The lower floors are for commercial use. It has two basements for car-parks.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> Since about September 1966 the appellants (vendors) have been owners of various units comprising an 11.5% share in the land and buildingas follows: 53 car parking spaces in the lower basement, various units on the 9th and 10th (commercial) floors, 24 domestic flatsin the upper floors. These (described in the tender documents as "the Property") were offered for sale by tender in July 1997.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> The title deeds and documents relating to the property were made available for inspection by prospective purchasers when the invitationto tender was published. The units were offered for sale subject to existing tenancies. The Conditions of Sale (later incorporatedinto the agreement as part of its terms) provided in clause 19 that upon payment of the purchase price the vendors would "executeto the purchaser an assignment of the property subject as enumerated in the Conditions of Sale but otherwise free from encumbrances".</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> Clause 26 of the Conditions of Sale states :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"26. The Purchaser shall not be entitled to raise any objection or requisition in respect of the title to the Property and shall bedeemed to have accepted the Vendor's title to the Property prior to the Purchaser's submission of his tender. The Purchaser furtherdeclares confirms undertakes and warrants that the Purchaser shall complete the purchase of the Property in accordance with the termscontained herein irrespective of whether the Vendor's title to the Property is good or defective notwithstanding any rule of lawor equity to the contrary."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> The respondent (purchaser) submitted a tender for $118 million. This was accepted and an agreement for sale and purchase dated 19August 1997 was signed, pursuant to which the purchaser paid deposits totalling $11.8 million. Completion was due to take place on20 November 1997.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> After the agreement was signed the title deeds and documents were delivered to the purchaser's solicitors who raised no objectionsor requisitions with regard to the vendors' title upon perusal of the material. On the face of such material, the vendors' titlewas unimpeachable.</p>    <p class="heading">How the litigation arose</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> In February 1994 an action for damages for personal injuries was instituted against The Incorporated Owners of Sun Hing Building,a body corporate formed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a>. This arose from an accident 3 years earlier when a workman fell from bamboo scaffolding erected against the outside wallonto a scavenging lane at the back of the building and sustained very serious injuries. The scaffolding was old and disused. Theworkman had, at the suggestion of an employee of the incorporated owners, climbed up to the 3rd floor to help locate a burst pipeon the outside wall of the building. The bamboo collapsed. He fell and was rendered quadriplegic. In his action against the incorporatedowners for damages, he based his cause of action on the fact that the corporation was an occupier of the common parts pursuant tothe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>, and was negligent in allowing the scaffolding to remain and become dangerous. He also claimed that the corporation wasvicariously liable for the actions of their employee in suggesting that he should use the scaffolding in tracing the leak.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> In January 1997 the trial of the workman's claim was imminent. At a meeting of the management committee of the corporation on 30January 1997 it was decided that counsel should be instructed and money raised from the owners. On 15 August 1997 (4 days beforethe memorandum for sale of the property was signed) the committee published a notice to the effect that the claim (for over $30 million)had been set down for trial and substantial fees had to be collected from the owners.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> The trial began on 6 October and lasted 2 weeks. The incorporated owners were not legally represented as the management committeehad failed to raise the necessary funds, though two members of the committee were heard in person. On 30 October 1997 Seagroatt Jgave judgment in the workman's favour for $25.7 million together with interest and costs. It was a record sum and much prominencewas given to it in the news media.</p>    <p class="heading">The purchaser's action</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> On 21 October 1997 the purchaser's solicitors wrote to the vendors' solicitors drawing attention to the legal proceedings and (1)asking what "remedial action" was proposed so that the property could be sold "free from all encumbrances" and (2) complaining thatthe failure to disclose the existence of the claim constituted "material non-disclosure". The vendors' solicitors replied on 3 Novemberenclosing a copy of Seagroatt J's judgment and offered to set aside a sum of $4 million out of the proceeds of sale, based upon thevendors' proportionate share of liability pursuant to the judgment, to be held by the solicitors as stakeholders.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> On 10 November 1997 the purchaser's solicitors wrote rejecting the vendors' proposal and stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The judgment sum is HK$25,725,287.00 together with interest and costs to be taxed. Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a>, the judgment creditor is entitled to apply to Court to levy execution to enforce the Judgment against any owner. Our clientis particularly worried by declarations made by a number of small owners to the mass media to the effect that they have no moneyto satisfy the Judgment. Upon completion, our client may well be faced with the prospect of having execution of the Judgment leviedagainst itself with the consequence of having the abovementioned properties charged by the judgment creditor."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> The letter went on to say that by clause 19 of the Conditions of Sale the vendors had agreed to assign the property "subject as enumeratedin these conditions but otherwise free from encumbrances"; as a result of the vendors' failure to disclose the existence of the proceedingsthey were guilty of "material non-disclosure and misrepresentation"; if the purchaser had been made aware of the proceedings it wouldnot have tendered for the property. In these circumstances the purchaser gave notice of rescission and demanded the return of thedeposit of $11.8 million.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> By letter dated 11 November the vendors' solicitors replied saying that as the purchaser was not an owner at the time of the accidentand as no act or omission giving rise to the corporation's liability could be attributed to the purchaser, there was no possibilityof leave being given under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a><sup><sup><sup><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">1</a></sup></sup></sup> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> to enforce the judgment against it. However, to "cater for the most unlikely situation" of a charge arising against the propertyafter completion, the vendors undertook to set aside a sum of $33,025,758 out of the proceeds of sale, or make available a bank guaranteefor that amount, or any reasonable amount as the purchaser might suggest. This was subject to the condition that the purchaser wouldco-operate at the vendors' expense in opposing any application for leave to enforce the judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> This offer was rejected.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> The deadline for completion - 3 p.m. on 20 November 1997 - expired. No completion took place. By letter dated 21 November the vendors'solicitors gave notice of rescission and forfeiture of the deposit.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> Thus the battle lines were drawn.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> On 25 November 1997 the purchaser issued an originating summons seeking, among other reliefs, a declaration (1) that the vendorshad not shown good title to the property and (2) that the purchaser was entitled to rescind the agreement "by reason of the materialnon-disclosure and/or misrepresentation on the part of the [vendors]". On the eve of trial those reliefs were amended by deletingthe reference to "misrepresentation" and adding an averment to the effect that the purchaser was entitled to rescind on account ofthe vendors' inability to assign the property "free from encumbrances in accordance with Condition 19 of the Conditions of Sale ...".</p>    <p class="heading">The proceedings in the courts below</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> The matter went before Barnett J who, by his judgment dated 23 November 1998, dismissed the purchaser's claim. He held that the possibilityof the vendors having the judgment (or a proportionate part thereof) enforced against them was a potential liability which was personalto them; this was not a defect in title or an encumbrance upon the title; hence there was no obligation falling on the vendors todisclose the claim prior to the contract.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> The purchaser, being aggrieved, appealed to the Court of Appeal. That court by a majority (Mortimer VP and Godfrey JA), Rogers JAdissenting, allowed the purchaser's appeal with costs. Hence the vendors' appeal now before us.</p>    <p class="heading">Effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> The first question which arises on this appeal is this: If the purchaser had completed the sale and had become the registered ownerof the property, could the judgment for $25.7 million (or a proportionate part of it) have been enforced against it at the instanceof the injured workman? In this regard it makes no difference to the issue that, at the time of the trial before Barnett J, in November1998, the judgment had in fact been satisfied. The point turns upon a proper construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> Where judgments have been obtained against incorporated owners, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> empowers the Lands Tribunal to grant leave for such judgments to be enforced against the owners personally.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> The expression used in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> is "against any owner". Does this mean (i) against an owner <em>who was owner at the time the liability</em> was incurred as Mr Robert Tang SC, counsel for the vendors, contends or (ii) against an owner <em>for the time being</em> (that is to say, someone who was an owner at the time of the application for leave), as Mr John McDonnell QC, counsel for the purchaser,argues?</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> In <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> <em>owner</em> means -</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(a) a person who for the time being appears from the records at the Land Registry to be owner of an undivided share in land on whichthere is a building; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) a registered mortgagee in possession of such a share."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a> This, at first blush, concludes the argument in Mr McDonnell's favour. But this would be disregard the introductory words in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> "In this Ordinance, <em>unless the context otherwise requires</em> ...". The argument thus becomes a little more sophisticated. It is Mr Tang's case that the context in which the word <em>owner</em> is used requires its meaning in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> to be restricted, in the way he contends for.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p26" name="p26">26.</a> His argument, in a nut-shell, is this: The primary object of the Ordinance is to facilitate the incorporation of owners of flats;if there were no incorporation, and a visitor were injured, liability for breach of a common law duty of care would fall on the ownerspersonally; they would bear joint and several liability; this liability would not attach to the land and would not pass by operationof law to successive owners. It would, Mr Tang suggests, be contrary to the primary object of the statute to <em>enlarge</em> the class of persons who would attract personal liability, when the statute plainly aims at encouraging incorporation. Hence, MrTang argues, "owner" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> means <em>owner</em> <em>at the time the liability was incurred</em>; it cannot mean someone like the purchaser who comes along years later.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p27" name="p27">27.</a> Is this argument, superficially attractive, correct in the context of the entire statutory scheme?</p>    <p class="heading">Scheme of the statute</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p28" name="p28">28.</a> Focussing first of all on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> of the Ordinance, one sees that when the owners of a building have been incorporated under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a>, their rights, powers, privileges and duties in relation to the common parts "shall be exercised and performed by" the corporation;and their <em>liabilities</em> shall be enforceable against the corporation "<em>to the exclusion of the owners</em>". After incorporation a visitor injured on the common parts will no longer be able to seek redress against the owners personally.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p29" name="p29">29.</a> In relation to contingencies such as suits by third parties, it would be a matter for the corporation (or more accurately its managementcommittee) to decide whether to establish and maintain a contingency fund under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(2).</a> A contribution might be required from the owners from time to time. Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22(3)</a> the amount payable by an owner constitutes a debt due to the corporation: Here it must mean <em>owners for the time being</em>. In other words, once a demand for payment has been made of an owner, the liability attaches to his interest in land and passes tohis successors in title. This is reinforced by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> which empowers the corporation in limited circumstances to pass an owner's liability on to an occupier for the time being of theunit concerned. This view of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22</a> is consistent with the provisions of the Deed of Mutual Covenants in the present case. Clause 16(2)(f) provides that where an ownerfails to pay a contribution as determined by the management committee within 30 days, that sum (together with the costs and expensesincurred in recovering the same) "shall be charged on the share or interest of the defaulting owner" and a memorial of such chargemay be registered in the Land Office against that share.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p30" name="p30">30.</a> Similarly, if a corporation is wound up under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a>-<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">34</a><sup><sup><sup><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">2</a></sup></sup></sup>, the owners for the time being have to contribute according to their respective shares; there is no basis on which a distinctioncould be drawn between owners who owned shares in the building at the time the liability was incurred and owners at the commencementof the winding-up.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p31" name="p31">31.</a> It must be borne in mind that the primary meaning of "owner" in the Ordinance is "a person who for the time being appears from therecords at the Land Registry to be the owner of an undivided share ...". In my judgment, there is nothing in the context which requiresthe meaning of owner in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> to be construed differently. This construction accords with the scheme in the Deed of Mutual Covenants applicable in the presentcase - and perhaps countless others - where the rights and liabilities of owners generally pass with the land.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p32" name="p32">32.</a> If the position were otherwise, the management of multi-storey buildings, particularly in large estates, would be a highly complexaffair. In the course of managing such properties, all kinds of liability might be incurred by the corporation: claims by employeesfor damages for wrongful dismissal, severance pay etc; claims by contractors for the supply of goods and services; and claims bythird parties arising from the corporation's occupation of the common areas. Some of these claims might be contested, others settled.Eventually judgment of one kind or another might be entered against the corporation. Plainly, the management committee would treatthem alike and would seek contribution from the owners for the time being to satisfy the liabilities as they arise, if the fundsestablished for the purpose were insufficient or if they needed topping up. Hence, liability would fall on the owners for the timebeing as a matter of course: It would be an odd thing, in these circumstances, if the recourse to the owners under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> should be treated differently.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p33" name="p33">33.</a> This was the assumption upon which all four judges in the courts below proceeded. In my judgment, this approach is correct. The LandsTribunal is empowered under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)(b)</a> to give leave to enforce judgment against an owner who becomes owner after the date when the original liability was incurred. Thetribunal's discretion is wide. Depending upon the circumstances of the case it might in its discretion limit the order in the firstplace to the owner's proportionate share in the land and building, leaving the balance (if any) to be recovered upon the windingup of the corporation. Conceivably, there might be circumstances where it would be proper to give leave for a larger proportion oreven the entire judgment to be executed against one owner, leaving it to that owner to seek contribution from his co-owners.</p>    <p align="justify" class="quote"><em>"Blot on title"</em></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p34" name="p34">34.</a> The workman's claim for damages against the corporation, and the eventual judgment given on that claim, was extraordinary in magnitude.There is no suggestion, upon the material before us, that the management committee considered it unlikely to succeed or that it hadreceived advice to that effect. The judge found as a fact that a few days before the memorandum of agreement was signed there wasa call for contribution from the owners towards the legal costs involved in defending the claim: The amount sought was $800,000 andit had to be collected by 6 September. The claim was said to be for over $30 million. In these circumstances it would not have beenunusual if the committee had sought substantial contributions from the owners towards a contingency fund to be established under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(2)</a> to meet part of the claim even before <em>judgment</em>. But <em>after</em> judgment, the requirement of contributions from the owners became a certainty: The corporation did not have the resources to satisfythe judgment. On any view of the facts, the purchaser of the units was, at the time of contract, very likely to be saddled with liabilitieswholly outside its contemplation: After Seagroatt J's judgment, this became a certainty.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p35" name="p35">35.</a> This is the context in which the question of the "blot on title" must be viewed. The crucial point is this: A liability which attachesto an owner for the time being is one which binds successive owners and thus runs with the property. Whilst, in the case of a multi-storeybuilding, there might be many such liabilities which are ordinary incidents of property ownership, here the court is faced with aliability wholly outside the contemplation of a reasonable purchaser. The question thus arises: What this is a defect in title? Inthis regard I have read in draft the joint judgment of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ and agree with it.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p36" name="p36">36.</a> I also agree with Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ on the two remaining points: The offer of indemnity and clause26 of the contract.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p37" name="p37">37.</a> In these circumstances, the appeal must be dismissed, with costs.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Ching PJ :</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p38" name="p38">38.</a> I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Litton PJ and the joint judgment of Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ:</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p39" name="p39">39.</a> The judgment of Mr Justice Litton PJ relieves us from the necessity of stating the facts except in so far as further elaborationis needed to explain our conclusions on the points that arise for decision.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p40" name="p40">40.</a> The question at issue is whether the respondent purchaser was entitled to rescind the contract for sale on the ground that the liabilityor potential liability on the part of unit owners ("the owners") arising out of the action brought by the injured workman againstthe incorporated owners of the building ("the corporation") constituted a defect in the appellant vendors' title. The respondent'srescission was expressed to be for non-disclosure of a latent defect in title. Nonetheless the respondent will be entitled to succeedif it can show that a defect in title prevented the appellants from either showing or giving a good title, subject to any qualificationmade by the contract to the vendors' obligations in these respects.</p>    <p class="heading">The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a> ("the Ordinance")</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> The first question for decision is as to the nature and scope of the liability of unit owners to meet a liability of the incorporatedowners, it being common ground that the corporation was directly liable to the injured workman for the amount of the judgment whichhe was awarded. In the ordinary course of events, a liability (including an unexpected liability) of the corporation would be metfrom the funds of the corporation established under s.20 of the Ordinance. The management committee would determine under s.21 theamounts to be contributed by the owners. The amount to be contributed by an owner towards the amount determined under s.21 is fixedby the management committee in accordance with the deed of mutual covenant (if any) and is payable at such times and in such manneras the management committee may determine (s.22(1)). In the absence of appropriate provision in a deed of mutual covenant, the amountto be contributed by an owner is fixed by the management committee in accordance with the respective shares of the owners (s.22(2)).The amount so payable by an owner is a debt due and payable from him to the corporation (s.22(3)).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> If it becomes necessary to enforce a judgment against a corporation, execution may issue against (a) any property of the corporationor (b), with the leave of the Lands Tribunal, against any owner (s.17). What is required is leave to issue <em>execution</em> to enforce a judgment against a corporation against an owner, not leave to issue an <em>action</em> against an owner. And in the winding-up of a corporation, the owners are liable, both jointly and severally, to contribute, accordingto their respective shares, to the assets of the corporation to an amount sufficient to discharge its debts and liabilities (s.34).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p43" name="p43">43.</a> We agree, for the reasons given by Mr Justice Litton PJ, that the references to "owner" in the provisions to which we have referredare references to "owner for the time being". In our view, the contrary argument advanced by the appellants is plainly incorrect.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p44" name="p44">44.</a> The consequence of this interpretation is that the liability to meet a notice of contribution fixed by the management committee goeswith the unit and is imposed upon the owner for the time being. The contribution liability, though proportionate to the share ofthe owner, has the potential to merge into a joint and several liability on a winding-up for an amount sufficient to discharge thecorporation's liabilities. Moreover, there is the potential liability under s.17(1)(b) to suffer an execution for a judgment againstthe corporation. That liability is not expressed to be limited to the proportionate share of an individual owner.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p45" name="p45">45.</a> There is no reason to think that leave under s.17(1)(b) would be refused if the corporation is unable to meet a judgment againstit and the execution is limited to the proportionate share of the individual owner. If execution in a greater amount were soughtagainst an individual owner, difficulties would arise. The Tribunal might require other owners to be joined or served and evidencegiven as to their financial situation. But in a case where some owners are unable to make good their proportionate share of the totalliability, the Tribunal could grant leave to execute beyond the level of the proportionate share of an individual owner. After all,in a winding-up, unit owners are jointly and severally responsible for the amount necessary to discharge the corporation's liabilities.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> Viewed in this light, the judgment against the corporation obtained by the workman on 30 October 1997 for $25,725,287 with interestand costs had a special significance. Subject to leave, it became enforceable against unit owners, just as if it were a judgmentagainst a unit owner for the time being.</p>    <p class="heading">Is the liability of an owner to meet a contribution a defect of title?</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p47" name="p47">47.</a> Although the liability is not a charge on the unit itself, it is a liability which goes with ownership of the unit. It is a liabilitywhich is imposed in virtue of ownership of the unit. In <strong>Jones v. Barnett</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%201%20Ch%20611" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] 1 Ch. 611</a> at 620, Romer J noted "In Wharton's Law Lexicon I find 'incumbrance' defined as being 'a claim, lien, or <em>liability attached to property</em>'" (our emphasis). Although the liability of the unit owner to meet a contribution is not charged on the unit, it binds the unit andtherefore it can constitute a blot on the title or an incumbrance. See <strong>Rignall Developments Ltd v. Halil</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20Ch%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 Ch. 190.</a> There Millett J held that an improvement grant under the Housing Act 1974 which was repayable on demand by the owner for the timebeing of the property, was more than a personal liability "because the potential liability binds successive owners of the propertyaffected" (at 199).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p48" name="p48">48.</a> Accordingly, we disagree with the statement of Barnett J at first instance in the present case when his Lordship said with referenceto a unit owner's liability to pay a contribution :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"What is not well understood, at least by me, is that the reverse is also true if Mr Fung is correct, namely that a liability personalto the owner qua owner somehow translates into an encumbrance on his property".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">With respect, this statement overlooks the circumstance that a liability which attaches to the owner for the time being is one whichbinds successive owners and thus binds the property.

Such a liability, if it were so extraordinary havingregard to matters such as its nature or magnitude as to be wholly outside the contemplation of a reasonable purchaser, would constitutea defect in title.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p51" name="p51">51.</a> As the judgment in this case was delivered after contract (12 August 1997 subsequently recorded in a memorandum on 19 August) butbefore the date fixed for completion (20 November 1997), the question is : what is the position when, before the date fixed for completion,judgment in respect of such a liability in a substantial amount has been obtained against the corporation?</p>    <p class="heading">Does the existence of the liability confirmed by the judgment constitute a defect in title?</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> The effect of the judgment is simply to convert the pre-existing cause of action by the workman against the corporation into a matterof record, transit <em>in rem judicatam</em> (<strong>The Koursk</strong> [1924] P.140 at 149, per Bankes LJ). The delivery of the judgment enables us to see, with the benefit of hindsight, that there wasa cause of action giving rise to an actual liability on the part of the corporation, the amount of that liability being ascertainedby the judgment. So, at the time of contract there was an actual, not merely a contingent, liability on the part of the corporation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> The effect of the judgment was that execution could issue against the property of the corporation and, subject to leave, againstan owner and that means against the property of an owner, including his share in the building. The entry of the judgment also createda situation in which the management committee had no alternative but to give notice to the unit owners under ss.21 and 22, determiningthe amounts of contribution payable by them to meet the judgment and the time when the amounts were to be payable. No such noticewas given before the time fixed by the contract for completion. But, the judgment having been given against the corporation, theissue of such notices was a matter of certainty because the corporation was unable to pay the amount of the judgment from funds availableto it.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> Nevertheless, had the contract been completed on the date fixed for completion, the vendor would have been able to convey what onits face at that date was a good title. But it was a title which, after the date fixed for completion, would certainly subject theowner to a very substantial and extraordinary liability arising out of the use and occupation, prior to contract, of the common partsof the building by the corporation, a use and occupation which gave rise to the liability in tort.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p55" name="p55">55.</a> The burden is on the vendor to prove a good title to the very high standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the purchaser willnot be at risk of a successful assertion against him of an incumbrance (<strong>MEPC Ltd v. Christian-Edwards</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 205</a> at 220). The vendor discharges his obligation if he shows to that standard that he is in a position to convey the estate or interestcontracted to be sold "without any blot, or possibility of litigation to the purchaser" (<strong>In re Stirrup's Contract</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%201%20WLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 1 WLR 449</a> at 454).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p56" name="p56">56.</a> The general principle is well-recognised that as from the date of the contract for the sale of land, if anything happens to the estatebetween the time of sale and the time of completion, caused without the vendor's fault, it is at the risk of the purchaser (<strong>Lysaght v. Edwards</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%202%20Ch%20D%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 2 Ch D 499</a>, per Jessel MR; Megarry &amp; Wade, The Law of Real Property 6th ed, 2000, at 696; Williams on Vendor and Purchaser 4th ed, 1936,at 547). So, if a notice or order issued by a local authority which would otherwise constitute a defect in the vendor's title wasnot given or served so as to become effective before the contract, the purchaser cannot complain. He has agreed to purchase subjectto the risk that such a notice or order may issue after he has become the equitable owner of the property. (See Turner &amp; Sutton: Actionable Non-Disclosure 2nd ed., 1990, para.7.13). Hence in <strong>Fletcher v. Manton</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2064%20CLR%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 64 CLR 37</a>, where the statute authorising a demolition order required service of it on the owner before it became effective and the order wasserved after the date of the contract, it was held that the purchaser had become the equitable owner upon the making of the contractand that, as the property was thenceforth at his risk, he must bear the loss consequential upon demolition. The service of the noticedid not enable the purchaser to rescind the contract.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p57" name="p57">57.</a> In England, it seems to have been accepted that the existence of circumstances which create a risk, even a probability, that theproperty will become liable to a statutory charge or burden does not constitute a latent defect in title.

Although the judgment of Barnett J at first instance in the present case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%204%20HKC%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 4 HKC 656</a> may be regarded as a departure from this approach , the judgment rested on what is, for present purposes, an unduly narrow conceptionof an incumbrance. Conversely, where the risk of action being taken in relation to the presence of an unauthorised structure on theland may be safely disregarded, there is no defect in title (<strong>Spark Rich (China) Ltd v. Valrose Ltd</strong> (1999) CACV No.249/98). In the same vein, it was held (in <strong>Jumbo Gold Investment Ltd v. Yuen Cheong Leung</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20HKLRD%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 HKLRD 763</a> at 770-771) that there is no defect in title even though there may be a breach of condition giving the Government a right of re-entryif there is in truth no real risk of the Government actually exercising that right.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p60" name="p60">60.</a> The approach taken by the courts in Hong Kong to the existence of a defect in title arising from the presence of an unauthorisedstructure on land the subject of the sale is now so well entrenched that we should not depart from it. That conclusion does not disposeof the question here because the nature of the defect complained of is different.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p61" name="p61">61.</a> Though different, the defect in title to which the respondent purchaser is exposed has its source in the use and occupation of commonproperty in which the vendors as the owners of units had rights of enjoyment. The appellants' ownership of 7,217 undivided sharesin the Sun Hing Building (out of 62,639 shares) entailed ownership of a corresponding share in the corporation (Ordinance, s.39).The defect relates to the title of the property sold, because the potential liability to contribute to the funds of the corporationand satisfy the judgment is an inseparable incident of the ownership of the undivided shares.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p62" name="p62">62.</a> As against the respondent it can be urged that a general liability to meet future contributions levied by the management committeeis not only foreseeable but expected. That is certainly true in relation to contributions to meet ordinary running expenses. Andcontributions in relation to the cost of renewal of particular parts of the property, though not necessarily expected, are withinthe contemplation of a reasonable purchaser. The same may be said about contributions to meet a liability to a third party in contractor tort. There is no occasion why, in the ordinary course, a purchaser should need protection against a liability to contribute toexpenses of this kind. Where, however, the liability to contribute is extraordinary in view of its magnitude so that it exceeds whatany reasonable purchaser might be expected to have in contemplation, there is a powerful case for saying that there is a defect intitle - not because it simply affects the value of the unit (which it may do in a very substantial way) but because it will affectat some time in the future the title. It will affect the title and the purchaser will end up not with a title free from liability(which he contracted to get) but with a title which carries with it a substantial liability even if limited to its proportionateshare or, if not so limited, an even greater liability. Here that greater liability could conceivably amount to $25,725,287 plusinterest and costs.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p63" name="p63">63.</a> In the present case the incumbrance does not have its origins, as the incumbrances in a number of the cases do, in the exercise ofpowers by the Government or a statutory authority. It arises out of the tortious liability of the corporation for the antecedentuse and occupation of the common property. In this situation, there is no reason to treat the incumbrance or blot on title whichsubsequently arises as a fortuitous risk which the purchaser should bear.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p64" name="p64">64.</a> Another matter which might be urged against the respondent is that an intending purchaser should make inquiries before contract andprotect himself either by not entering into a contract or by entering into a contract with an appropriate contractual provision.There are two answers to this suggestion. First, the management committee of the corporation is under no obligation to answer inquiriesabout the financial position of the corporation or the likely amount of contributions to be sought from unit owners. It is thereforeunlikely that inquiries will prove a fruitful source of relevant information. Secondly, and more importantly, the practice in HongKong according to which binding contracts for the sale of units are ordinarily brought into existence does not allow for the makingof inquiries by purchasers before contract. In the ordinary run of cases, a provisional but legally binding contract, produced bya property agent, anxious to clinch a deal, is signed by the parties. It is against this background that the relevant principle governingthe vendor's obligation to show and give a good title is to be ascertained.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p65" name="p65">65.</a> What we have just said is a sufficient response to an argument based on the maxim <em>caveat emptor.</em> The maxim should not be applied so that it leaves a purchaser exposed to a serious detriment the risk of which is solely within theknowledge or the means of knowledge of the vendor.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p66" name="p66">66.</a> On the question of the appellants' knowledge we should refer to the findings of the primary judge. His Lordship found that the appellantsbefore contract knew of the pending action and of the amount potentially involved. The action had been on foot for three years priorto the contract which was made on 12 August 1997. The learned judge also found that the appellants' agents or representatives (oneof whom was a member of the committee of the corporation) should have made it their business to find out how the action was progressingand about the business of the corporation generally. The judge found that the appellants had knowledge of all relevant matters. Inthe words of the judge (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%204%20HKC%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 4 HKC 656</a>, 660G) the appellants</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"knew of the pending action; of the amount potentially involved; of the call by the notice of 15 August 1997 for contributions towardscosts; and by 30 October of the threat that the judgment might be enforced against individual owners."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p67" name="p67">67.</a> So, even before the date of the contract, the appellants were aware of the magnitude of the claim, the existence of the pending actionand inferentially that the hearing was not far off.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p68" name="p68">68.</a> The magnitude of the judgment liability was such as to be wholly outside the contemplation of a reasonable purchaser.</p>    <p class="heading">The offer of indemnity</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p69" name="p69">69.</a> The appellants rely upon an offer of indemnity which they made. They offered to set aside a sum of $33,025,758.00 out of the purchaseprice or, alternatively, make available a bank guarantee for that amount or any other reasonable amount that the respondent mightnominate. This offer was designed to reinforce an undertaking to meet the judgment in the event that the Lands Tribunal should giveleave to enforce the judgment against the respondent after completion of the contract.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p70" name="p70">70.</a> The offer of indemnity did not resolve all the problems which flowed from the existence of the potential liability. Barnett J, atfirst instance, outlined them in this way ([1998]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20HKC%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 HKC 656</a> at 661), quoting what a director of the purchaser said on affirmation :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"after completion the new owner of the Property would still have to be burdened with proceedings regarding the enforcement of theJudgment, any appeal or cross-appeal and the potential claims for contribution from and against the numerous small co-owners. Thiswas never within the contemplation of the Plaintiff at the time when it submitted the Tender. This would also affect the saleabilityof the Property and the ability of any purchaser to obtain a mortgage thereon. This is because if a property is subject to substantiallitigation, its marketability is substantially reduced for people would not like to be involved in and/or burdened with court proceedings.The purpose of the Plaintiff in purchasing the Property was for investment. The marketability of the Property which affects the price,was the dominant factor in its consideration whether to tender for the Property. If the litigation had been disclosed, the Plaintiffdefinitely would not have tendered for the Property."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p71" name="p71">71.</a> There was, in addition, evidence (which was uncontradicted) that the two banks which had been prepared to finance 60% of the purchaseprice withdrew on learning of the judgment. Sub-purchasers lost interest for the same reason.</p>    <p class="heading">Clause 26 of the contract</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p72" name="p72">72.</a> The appellants rely upon cl. 26 of the contract. Clause 26 is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The Purchaser shall not be entitled to raise any objection or requisition in respect of the title to the Property and shall be deemedto have accepted the Vendor's title to the Property prior to the Purchaser's submission of his tender. The Purchaser further declaresconfirms undertakes and warrants that the Purchaser shall complete the purchase of the Property in accordance with the terms containedherein irrespective of whether the Vendor's title to the Property is good or defective notwithstanding any rule of law or equityto the contrary."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p73" name="p73">73.</a> There are two relevant elements in cl. 26. The first is that the purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the vendor's title priorto the submission of the tender. The second is the undertaking to complete whether the vendor's title is good or defective "notwithstandingany rule of law to the contrary".</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p74" name="p74">74.</a> Clauses of this kind have not been regarded as compelling a purchaser to accept a defective title when the vendor has failed to disclosedefects of which he was aware (<strong>Becker v. Partridge</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20QB%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 QB 155</a> at 171, per Danckwerts LJ). This result has been attributed to a rule of law which overrides the contractual provision. But the preferableview expressed by Lord Hoffmann NPJ (with whom Li CJ and Nazareth NPJ concurred) in <strong>Jumbo King Ltd v. Faithful Properties Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%202%20HKCFAR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 2 HKCFAR 279</a> at 299, is that the question is one of construction of the relevant contractual provision. His Lordship said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"<em>Prima facie,</em> it is the duty of the vendor to deduce and then convey a good title and if he relies upon the terms of the contract to shift therisk of any defect in title to the purchaser, the language must clearly do so. As Farrand says, the question is whether the purchaserwould have been aware of the risk he was being asked to take. So, for example, general words which did not identify any specificdefect in title have been held inadequate to protect the vendor against liability for a serious defect which he could easily havediscovered: <em>Becker v. Partridge</em>".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">That is the case here. The respondent was not aware of the risk it was being asked to take. It was not aware of the defect.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p75" name="p75">75.</a> In the result, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Chief Justice Li :</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p76" name="p76">76.</a> The Court unanimously dismisses this appeal with costs.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Andrew Li)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Henry Litton)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">(Charles Ching)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Chief Justice</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Permanent Judge</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">Permanent Judge</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Kemal Bokhary)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Sir Anthony Mason)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Permanent Judge</td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Non-Permanent Judge</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Robert C Tang SC and Mr Horace Y L Wong (instructed by Messrs Fairbairn Catley Low &amp; Kong) for the appellant vendors</p>        <p align="justify">Mr John McDonnell QC and Mr Patrick Fung SC (instructed by Messrs Baker &amp; McKenzie) for the respondent purchaser</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">1</td>                <td valign="top" width="95%">                    <p align="justify"><em>17.
