One of the shareholders and the managing director of Nelv was Hideaki Shiota (<b>âShiotaâ</b>), who was from Japan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Through the introduction of Mok Kam Chun, Ray (<b>âMokâ</b>), Shiotaâs friend, the Plaintiff was appointed as the company secretary and auditor of Nelv since its incorporation.  The Plaintiffwas also the auditor of Mokâs company.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The Defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendant joined Nelv as a company accountant on 8 April 2005 when she was aged about 48.  She was not a qualified professionalaccountant but had over 20 years of relevant working experience by then.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">BACKGROUND</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 28 June 2005, there was a meeting in which Shiota, Mok and the Defendant were present (<b>âthe 28 June Meetingâ</b>).  On this occasion, the Defendant allegedly said things which were slanderous about the Plaintiffâs performance and professionalismas Nelvâs auditor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the following day, Mok informed the Plaintiff of the Defendantâs alleged criticism.  This prompted the Plaintiff to send aletter to the Defendant on the same day, demanding her to specify the factual basis of her adverse statements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The reply came from Shiota by letter in July 2005 on behalf of Nelv.  It explained that this was a misunderstanding of language. Meanwhile, the Plaintiff received a letter from one Yip Man Tin (<b>âYipâ</b>), CPA, saying that he had been invited to act as auditor of Nelv.  The Plaintiff also received what appeared to be a letter fromNelv informing the Plaintiff of Nelvâs decision to replace him by one Yâs Consulting Limited (<b>âYâsâ</b>) as the company secretary.  The Plaintiff was asked to resign and to transfer all the company documents to Yâs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  By letter dated 25 July 2005, the Plaintiff, through his solicitors, demanded the Defendant, among other things, to withdraw thealleged defamatory statements and to apologise as well as to indemnify the Plaintiff for legal costs in the sum of HK$1,000.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Shiota had second thought about replacement of the auditor.  He invited the Plaintiff to attend a meeting at the office of Nelvon 29 July 2005.  There the Plaintiff confronted the Defendant.  Shiota confirmed the retention of the Plaintiff as the companyâsauditor and company secretary.  Upon that, the Defendant tendered her resignation and left the company on the same day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Shiota later revealed that prior to the 28 June Meeting, the Defendant had sent electronic mails to him including one dated 17 June2005 and one dated 21 June 2005 (where appropriate, collectively referred to as <b>âthe E-mailsâ</b>).  The E-mails allegedly contained libellous remarks about the Plaintiffâs performance and professionalism as Nelvâs auditor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  By letter dated 27 September 2005, the Plaintiff through his solicitors repeated his previous complaint.  He also complained aboutthe E-mails, copies of which were also enclosed.  He made demand for, among other things, an apology and legal costs, this time inthe sum of HK$5,000.  The Defendantâs solicitors at first requested for time to reply.  By subsequent letter, the Defendantâssolicitors informed the Plaintiffâs solicitors that they had no instruction to accept any service of legal proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff commenced this action on the basis of the alleged slander during the 28 June Meeting and the alleged libel containedin the E-mails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Except for the alleged defamation, the above background was not in dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">THE ALLEGED LIBEL</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  I set out below the contents of the E-mails, rather than simply referring to the alleged libellous parts which were pleaded.

This remained to be the position at the commencementof the trial.  The issues to be decided are:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the statements were made;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the statements, if made, were defamatory;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the statements, if made and defamatory, were excused by the defence of qualified privilege (and in this regard, whether thedefence did not avail the Defendant due to malice on her part); and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">if defamation is proved, what compensation should be awarded to the Plaintiff.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Though the Plaintiff became aware of the E-mails subsequent to the 28 June Meeting, the meeting was apparently related to, if nota development of, what the Defendant said in the E-mails.  I would therefore consider the matter in the right time sequence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">WITNESSES</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Besides the parties to the action, Shiota, Mok and Anita Leung, the warehouse supervisor of Nelv, also gave evidence.  It shouldbe noted that they were all called as the Plaintiffâs witnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">WHETHER THE STATEMENTS WERE MADE</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The 17 June E-mail</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendant argued that part of the 17 June E-mail, namely, the sentence âeffect our company lost more money HK$1,357,290âas well as the paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 now appearing therein, never existed in this e-mail when she sent it to Shiota.  She alsoargued that part of what should be in this e-mail had been deleted after she sent it.  She specifically disputed the authenticityof this e-mail produced by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  During trial, Mr. Wong for the Defendant confirmed that the Defendant no longer disputed the authenticity of this e-mail.  Thishappened only after the evidence of the Plaintiff and in the course of the cross-examination of Shiota.  When the Defendant gaveevidence, such concession appeared to be less than unequivocal, as she simply did not want to waste time on this issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The 21 June E-Mail</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  There was no dispute over the Defendantâs sending of the 21 June E-mail to Shiota.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The 28 June Meeting</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Defendant denied that she spoke the words during the 28 June Meeting as pleaded by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Plaintiff learned about the alleged defamatory statements from Mok on the day following the meeting.  Mok confirmed that.  Theaccuracy of these statements would depend on first, the accuracy of Mokâs recollection of what the Defendant said; and secondly,the accuracy of the Plaintiffâs record of them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Wong for the Defendant attempted to cast doubt on the accuracy of what appeared to be a verbatim account of the statements. He questioned Mokâs ability to fully understand and to remember what the Defendant said in the absence of spontaneous writtenrecord.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  What was said during the meeting probably exceeded the 6 statements in question.  However, I have reasons to believe that Mok wouldregister on his mind what the Defendant said about the Plaintiffâs performance as Nelvâs auditor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There was no dispute that on the day in question, Shiota asked the Defendant to also meet with Mok for the exact purpose of explaining,directly and in Cantonese, her observation about the Plaintiffâs performance.  According to Mok, Shiota has prior to the meetingexpressed concern about the performance of the Plaintiff as Nelvâs auditor.  What prompted Shiota to do so must be the Defendantâsreport to him previously including what she stated in the E-mails.  One would expect the Defendantâs explanation to Mok to be inline with her such report to Shiota including the E-mails too.  Exact wordings aside, common in both the E-mails and the statementsallegedly made during the meeting were the accusations that the Plaintiff has been unprofessional in auditing, which caused Nelvto pay more than necessary tax.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mok was concerned too.  It was he who introduced the Plaintiff to Shiota.  His company also used the Plaintiffâs service.  Thiswas why Shiota believed that  Mok should be informed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  On the following day, Mok informed the Plaintiff of the accusations.  As a result, the Plaintiff issued his letter dated 30 June2005 to the Defendant demanding explanation.  Prior to sending the letter, the Plaintiff took care to ask Mok to confirm the accuracyof the Plaintiffâs recital of the meaning of the Defendantâs statements in the letter.  Mok did so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Therefore, much attention had in fact been paid by Mok in conveying and by the Plaintiff in reciting the Defendantâs statementswithin just a couple of days after the 28 June Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Even giving the benefit of doubt to the Defendant, I am still satisfied that statements 2, 3 and 6 did not involve any technicalitywhich would have rendered it difficult for Mok to understand and to recite.  Statements 3 and 6 were certainly in line with her criticismof the Plaintiff in the E-mails.  As explained above, this would have been expected in the circumstances.  I therefore disagree withthe suggestion by Mr. Wong for the Defendant that Mok was influenced by the E-mails, which Shiota showed him after the 28 June Meeting,to believe that the Defendant said those defamatory words.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  What did the Defendant say in this regard?  To begin with, the Defendant herself pleaded that she was supposed to tell Mok the fullparticulars of âthe Plaintiffâs bad serviceâ and âall the performance problems of the Plaintiff which she had spottedâ. One would have expected that to be in line with her previous reports to Shiota including the E-Mails.  Contrary to that, her statementsuggested that nothing sounding critical appeared to have been said about the Plaintiff during that meeting.  Without reference tothe âbad serviceâ and âperformance problemsâ of the Plaintiff, I wonder how she explained to Mok why the Plaintiff had tobe replaced.  As Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff submitted, one could not help feeling that the Defendant in her statement was just tryingto exculpate herself from any remarks which attributed fault to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The reply (by Shiota on behalf of Nelv) dated 4 July 2005 to the Plaintiffâs letter dated 30 June 2005 suggested that the Plaintiffâsaccount of what the Defendant allegedly said at the 28 June Meeting was the result of a misunderstanding of language.  There wasno elaboration.  It was completely silent as to whether it was misunderstanding on the part of Mok or the Plaintiff or both.  Itwas equally silent as to what misunderstanding of language there could be between the Defendant and Mok who talked the same dialect. The difference between the evidence of Mok/the Plaintiff and that of the Defendant in this respect could hardly be explained bysimple reference to un-particularised misunderstanding of language.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Defendantâs replies through her solicitors since the end of July 2005 contained simple denial without any elaboration of thealleged misunderstanding at the meeting either.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Considering the evidence, I do not doubt Mokâs understanding or memory of the statements made by the Defendant during the 28 JuneMeeting.  I also do not doubt the Plaintiffâs recital of the same.  I doubt the Defendantâs evidence in this regard.  I findthat the statements, in particular statements 3 and 6, were in fact made.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">WHETHER THE STATEMENTS WERE DEFAMATORY</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The Defendant denied that the wordings of the statements, if made, were capable of bearing any meaning defamatory of the Plaintiff. She maintained this position until her counselâs submissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  A statement is defamatory of the person of whom it is published if it tends to lower him in the estimation of right thinking membersof society generally or if it exposes him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule or if it causes him to be shunned or avoided: see<i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (10<sup>th</sup> ed) at para.2.1.

According to the Defendant, whatshe actually meant was that the fee was a relatively big sum in the light of the cash flow problem of Nelv.  I am not impressed bythe Defendantâs explanation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr. Wong for the Defendant argued that in any event, comment that the Plaintiffâs fee was too expensive could not be defamatory. However, one needs to understand this statement in the context and as a part of this e-mail.  In my view, this was part of the Defendantâscriticism that the Plaintiff was unprofessional in the audit and guilty of causing financial loss to the company.  This statementwould reasonably be understood to mean that the fee, for these reasons, far exceeded what the Plaintiffâs service was worth.  Thistoo was just defamatory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The 21 June E-mail</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Once again, the Defendant stated at the beginning of this e-mail that the audit fee charged by the Plaintiff was too expensive. I refer to what I said above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The Defendant went on to say that the Plaintiff made mistake in the audit and thus causing the company to pay more tax than it shouldhave paid.  The audit report was said to be no good after she has consulted one of Nelvâs bankers.  Mr. Wong for the Defendantconceded in his submissions that these statements were also untrue and defamatory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">28 June Meeting</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Without necessarily endorsing entirely the meaning of the 6 statements in question as pleaded by the Plaintiff, I am of the viewthat their ordinary and natural meaning should be quite apparent to any ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded reader.  Guided by generalknowledge, such a reader should be able to infer and imply from statements 1, 4, 5 and 6 that the Plaintiff was being accused ofbeing incompetent in carrying out the audit in accordance with accountancy principles.  This caused the company to pay more tax thanit should have paid â a consistent accusation against the Plaintiff.  Statements 2 and 3 suggested the lack of efficiency and professionalismin the Plaintiffâs discharge of his duty as the auditor.  This should also be obvious to any reader.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  As regards the 6 statements in question, the Plaintiff gave evidence in detail to point out their falsity from the accountancy andprofessional auditing perspectives.  Between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, I have no difficulty in preferring the Plaintiffâsexplanation in these respects.  I find that they were untrue and defamatory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The defence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The Defendant relied on the defence of qualified privilege.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The relevant principles of law are trite and may be summarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It is in the public interest that persons should be allowed to speak freely on occasions when it is their duty to speak and to tellall they know or believe, <i>or</i> on occasions where it is necessary to speak in the protection of some self or common interest.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">On the first type of occasions, the maker of the statement would be under a legal, social or moral duty to make the statement andthe recipient (himself or through his representative) has a corresponding interest to receive it.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">On the second type of occasions, the maker of the statement is acting pursuant to his interest and the recipient has such a correspondinginterest or duty in relating to the statement; or the maker is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">In both cases, there must be reciprocity of interest.  âInterestâ is not construed in a technical sense but in the broadest popularsense as when we say a man is interested in knowing a fact â not interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity, but as amatter of substance apart from its mere quality as news.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(5)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It matters not whether the statement is made pursuant to the recipientâs enquiry or voluntarily so long as it is made in dischargeof the duty to inform.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" colspan="2">See <i>Gatley</i> at paras.14.4; 14.6; 14.13; 14.19; 14.21; 14.32</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The Defendant pleaded that even if the statements were made and defamatory, she made them under a legal, moral or social duty totell her honest opinion on the performance of the Plaintiff as auditor of Nelv to Shiota and Mok; and they also had correspondinginterest to be so told.  In other words, the Defendantâs pleaded case was the first type of qualified privilege mentioned above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The Defendant alleged that it was Shiota who by e-mail initiated the non-payment of the Plaintiffâs audit fees and asked whethershe agreed.  It was also Shiota who asked her whether the Plaintiff was professional.  The E-mails were merely her replies.  Shiotadenied that.  Neither were there such e-mails from Shiota in the evidence nor request for specific discovery of such e-mails fromShiota, if they did exist but were withheld.  I am also not convinced that if Shiota had formed his view about withholding paymentof audit fee as alleged, he would have found it necessary to seek the Defendantâs agreement.  I do not accept the Defendantâsevidence that the E-mails were her replies to previous e-mails from Shiota.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  However, as mentioned above, it matters not whether the statements were made as replies to enquiries or voluntarily so long as theywere made in discharge of the duty to inform.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I agree that the occasions on which the E-mails were sent to Shiota and the conversation between the Defendant and Mok took placewere <i>prima facie</i> such privileged occasions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In his submissions, Mr. Wong for the Defendant also proceeded on the basis that the statements, in the E-mails and the 26 June Meeting,were made in pursuance of interest, whether common or independently.  In other words, he argued that the present case was also thesecond type of privileged occasions.  Such contention has not been pleaded.  However, in view of the lack of objection by Mr. Wongfor the Plaintiff and also for completeness, I state my views on this alternative contention of the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Employees in a business, or employer and employee, have common interests in the success of the business or the way it is being carriedon: see <i>Gatley</i> at para.14.46.  Communication by the Defendant to Shiota about the companyâs situation and the performance of its auditor, whoseservices the company had to pay for, squarely fell into this category of common interest.  This applied to the statements made inthe E-mails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In the 28 June Meeting, the Defendant started the conversation with Mok pursuant to the instruction of Shiota.  This arose out ofthe fact that the Plaintiff was introduced by Mok and that Mok was also concerned about the allegedly bad performance of the Plaintiffas auditor of Nelv.  Mr. Wong for the Defendant relied on the case of <i>Angel v Bushell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20QB%20813" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 QB 813</a> at 830D-F, which, I agree, offers a comparable analogy.  The court held that in view of the third partyâs introduction and recommendationof the plaintiff, qualified privilege would attach <i>prima facie</i> to a communication from the defendant to the third party stating the reasons for the termination of the Defendantâs business relationswith the plaintiff.  It would so attach notwithstanding that the communication did not purport to be or was not in fact conveyedwith a view to discharging any duty or furthering any common interest (as discussed above).  I find that the 28 June Meeting was(by analogy) <i>prima facie</i> a privileged occasion on this basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Malice</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  If the statement maker is actuated by malice, he will not be able to rely on the privilege: see <i>Gatley</i> at para.14.4.  Qualified privilege is a defence only to the extent that <i>it throws on the plaintiff the burden of proving express malice</i>.  Directly the plaintiff succeeds in doing this, the defence vanishes, and it becomes immaterial that the publication was on a privilegedoccasion: see <i>Gatley</i> at para.16.2 citing <i>Smith v Streatfeild</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1913%5d%203%20KB%20764" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1913] 3 KB 764</a>, 796-770 per Bankes J.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The relevant law regarding malice was authoritatively reviewed by the English House of Lords in <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 135.</a>  Lord Diplockâs speech was referred to by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in <i>Albert Cheng &amp; Anor v Tse Wai Chun Paul</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20HKCFAR%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] HKCFAR 339</a> (in the context of the defence of fair comment).

Justification under (3) above was a defence actuallypleaded in <i>Lee Ching</i> but not in the present case.  By justification, Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff was referring to the Defendantâs justification of herthen belief rather than its truth.  By (3) and (4) above, Mr. Wong was referring to the Defendantâ conduct of the defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The defamatory statements basically arose out of two major criticisms about the Plaintiff:  First, the Plaintiff had made mistakesin the audit which caused Nelv to pay more than necessary tax.  Secondly, the qualified opinion contained in his auditor report hascaused problems to Nelv and was not justified.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In her evidence and not before, the Defendant conceded that such criticisms of the Plaintiff were wrong.  Nevertheless, she maintainedthat that was her <i>then</i> honest belief.  According to the pleading, such belief was allegedly based on the facts and matters <i>then</i> known to her shortly after she had joined Nelv (see paras. 3A and 3B of the Amended Defence).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The relevant time must be when the defamatory statements were made.  Was the Defendant indeed led by the facts and matters thenknown to her to make those criticisms?  Did she have any improper motive then in making those criticisms?</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Audit mistake</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In her e-mail dated 27 April 2005, the Defendant first raised the issue of the companyâs tax liability and alleged accountingproblems of Nelv.  This was less than 3 weeks since she started working there and was the day following the date of the notice ofassessment of Nelvâs tax liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The Defendant computed in the 17 June E-mail how much tax the Plaintiff has allegedly caused Nelv to pay over the 5 years from 2001to 2005.  With reference to the financial statements in the reports, her computations were proved to be incorrect.  Her accusationof the Plaintiff about missing account notes was also unfounded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  It was eventually revealed that while she criticised the Plaintiff for audit mistakes, she herself had not really prepared any accountsfor the company during the entire period of her employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In view of the relevant notice of assessment being dated 26 April 2005, any objection had to be lodged within 1 month from thatdate.  These were also prescribed in the notice.  No objection had been lodged by 25 May 2005.  However the Defendant still suggestedseeking tax refund in the E-mails in June 2005.  Allegedly that was what the Inland Revenue Department (<b>âthe IRDâ</b>) told her during her visit on 21 May 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Defendantâs recollection of her visit at the IRD was so confusing that she kept correcting her statements, the last time justbefore the trial.  But it was her approach of trying to puzzle together the visit and what might justify her statements in the E-mailswhich caused me concern.  One might at most infer from the IRDâs record that it might have been the Defendant who attended theenquiry centre on 21 May.  However there was no record of any interview, not to mention the advice which the IRD allegedly gave heron that day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>   Assuming that the Defendant did visit the IRD enquiry centre on 21 May, that should be the first such visit she made for the purposeof Nelvâs tax liability.   I would be surprised if the IRD considered it appropriate to give her such advice on that very day whena prima facie case of mistakes in the financial reports and the tax returns was yet to be established.  The IRD record revealed thatduring the other visit by the Defendant in as late as July 2005, the IRD still only advised her to apply for payment of tax by instalment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In my judgment, the Defendantâs recklessness was clearly evidenced by the fact that she did not realise the computation mistakesshe made in the 17 June E-mail and the account notes which she missed until being cross-examined in court.  Like how she came toconclude about the Plaintiffâs alleged audit mistakes, that Nelv could still obtain tax refund was, in my judgment, her subjectivebelief rather than one arrived at on an informed basis as alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">The qualified opinion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  There was no dispute that Nelv should know its tax liability at the end of April 2005.  According to the Defendant, the companydid not have sufficient cash flow to discharge the tax liability.  She therefore approached various banks in May 2005 with a viewto applying for loan.  The banks refused the applications invariably for one of the reasons that Nelvâs financial reports containedthe qualified opinion of the Plaintiff or âstock qualifiedâ as referred to in the evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In his evidence, Shiota confirmed that the Defendant mentioned the tax liability of the company.  He did not deny that the companymight have tight cash flow at the time.  He knew that the Defendant approached the banks and she reported that the qualified opinionin the auditorâs report affected the companyâs ability to borrow from the banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The qualified opinion referred to was contained in the auditorâs reports appended to the financial reports.  Typically, the auditorâsreport began with the definition of the respective responsibilities of the companyâs directors and the Plaintiff as the auditor. The rest went like this:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><u>Basis of opinion</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order toprovide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

There was no technical difficultyin this part of the report.  One needs no more than reading this part to know precisely why the qualified opinion was given.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The Defendant claimed that she was not aware of the existence of the qualified opinion until being informed by the banks as mentionedabove.  She attributed this partly to her mere attention to the figures in the reports and partly to her poor English standard. She also claimed that she had no idea what the qualified opinion meant until she went to consult the IRD.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The Defendant was not a CPA.  However she went so far as suggesting that she was essentially a bookkeeper and would not know muchabout auditing.  Referring to her over 20 years of relevant working experience, I share the difficulty of Mr. Wong for the Plaintiffin believing in the extent of ignorance she alleged.  Having said that, in view of her English standard both as demonstrated in theE-mails and as confirmed by Shiota, I am not surprised that she would not have the initiative of reading the auditorâs report indetail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The Defendant could have made enquiry with the Plaintiff about the qualified opinion.  The evidence was that the staff of the Plaintiffâsfirm whom she normally contacted did suggest this.  However the Defendant claimed that taking such a step would exceed her position. Rather, she chose to ask Shiota to contact Mok so that Mok would contact the Plaintiff about this.  She did not know whether Shiotadid so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  This is difficult to understand.  According to her resume, one of the duties of the Defendant when working for her previous employerswas invariably to contact the auditors directly.  She was specifically put in charge of the accounts of the company.  It would beodd for Shiota to expect the need to deal with the accounting matter personally, particularly when he obviously did not understandaccounting better.  Consistently this explained why he had to ask the Defendant to talk directly to Mok in the 28 June Meeting aboutthe Plaintiff.  It seems to me that it was not whether the Defendant was objectively in a position to contact the Plaintiff.  Rather,I doubt whether the Defendant intended to do so as far as she was able to avoid that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  In view of the auditorâs statutory and professional duty, one would not criticise his professionalism on the ground that his reportmay have problematic implication on the company, so long as it is sound.  The Defendant did criticise the basis of the Plaintiffâsqualified opinion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In criticising the Plaintiffâs practice of not attending the stocktaking at Nelv, the Defendant said she had never come acrossan auditor who would not attend stocktaking.  She further took the view that an auditor should have reserved his qualified opinionas a last resort.  She also believed that whether the accounts and stock records were accurate, an auditor could and should stillhave attended stocktaking.  Now she appealed to her knowledge and experience whilst at the same time claiming that she did not reallyknow much about auditing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The Defendant also criticised the factual basis of the qualified opinion.  She suggested that the stock and accounts documents werein fact not as messy as the Plaintiff described.  This was proved to be wrong as the stocktaking attended by Yâs in July 2005 detectedan average percentage error of 22.6% between the stock and the record.  According to the Plaintiff, a percentage error of more than5% would already render any stocktaking meaningless for the purpose of verifying accounts.  Cheung of Yâs also confirmed that thequalified opinion in the auditorâs report could not be removed in such circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The Defendant even went as far as suggesting that not attending stocktaking was the Plaintiffâs conscious decision due to hislack of manpower to cope.  I simply do not see any factual basis for this suggestion at all.  This appeared to me to be nothing morethan an afterthought of the Defendant rather than her belief at the relevant time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The Defendant alerted Shiota that Nelv might be subject to investigation and field audit by the IRD if the Plaintiffâs qualifiedopinion remained in the companyâs financial reports continuously.  Mr. Wong for the Defendant suggested that this was in line withthe IRDâs relevant Practice Directions.  However, reference to the relevant Practice Directions reveals a wide discretion in theIRD to select targets for such investigation.  A limited company may become a target if the auditor has given a qualified opinionin a significant aspect of the company accounts.  This could happen even in the absence of a period of repeated qualified opinion. However the fact was the IRD had never indicated such intention despite the existence of the qualified opinion in Nelvâs reportssince the second year of its business.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Further, I would understand if the IRD was concerned about whether the tax liability of the company targeted might have been under-assessed. The investigation would therefore be conducted to reveal the true state of affairs of the company on which the auditor has expresseda qualified opinion.  However, if the Defendant were believed in, Nelv had paid more tax that it should have.  Even the Defendantallegedly wanted to investigate the error in the financial statements in order to get a tax refund.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In my judgment, when criticising the Plaintiffâs qualified opinion, the Defendant concluded from nothing more than the fact thatthe existence of such opinion had caused problems and her surprise about the Plaintiffâs non-attendance of the stocktaking at Nelvfor consecutive years.  Likewise I do not believe that her belief of what the qualified opinion might entail to the detriment ofthe company was really founded on any properly informed basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  So there were all these problems with the basis of the Defendantâs criticisms of the Plaintiff.  They were hardly objective andsometimes without any informed basis.  Was that malice?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  What is required before ârecklessnessâ is equated with knowledge of falsity or indifference to truth has been mentioned above. Specificially, <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i> (above) at 150D-E says:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice,rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognise the cogency of materialwhich might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach.  But despite the imperfection of the mental process by whichthe belief is arrived at, it may still be âhonestâ, that is a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The Defendant did impress me as being subjective and stubborn.  I find that this resulted in her reckless and impulsive adverseconclusions about the Plaintiff.  However, as reminded by <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i> (above), I should be slow to conclude that the Defendant did not believe in her words.  As mentioned above, she told Mok during the28 June Meeting essentially what she meant in the E-mails to Shiota.  She knew she was called upon to do that because it was Mokwho introduced the Plaintiff to Shiota.  Had she been malicious, I wonder if she would have spelt out the defamatory statements withoutfear to Mok as the Plaintiff would likely get to know the same afterwards from Mok.  Indeed Mok did tell the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Conduct of the defence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff also invited me to draw inference of malice from the conduct of the defence in the course of litigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The most deplorable part of the defence must be the Defendantâs assertion that the 17 June E-mail had been tempered with and hisrefusal to acknowledge the falsity of her criticism about the Plaintiff until during the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The Defendant effectively suggested that the disputed part of the 17 June E-mail was inserted after she had sent it to Shiota. This could only be an allegation against the Plaintiff and/or Shiota.  She effectively made the same allegation against them in respectof the part of the e-mail allegedly crossed out.  Her concession in court was equivocal and entailed retraction of a substantialpart of her evidence contained in her statements.  The last-minute retraction of such allegation and evidence, in the absence ofsatisfactory explanation, inevitably entitled the court to draw adverse inference against her.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The Defendant apparently had no intention of conceding that her criticism about the Plaintiffâs qualified opinion was wrong eventhough she was aware, at the latest by mid-July 2005, that there were indeed problems with the companyâs stock lists and recordswhich well accounted for the Plaintiffâs qualified opinion.  She actually acknowledged those problems in her e-mail and the minutesof the company meeting then.  Notwithstanding that, there was no hint of concession in the pre-action correspondence or pleadingor her statements.  To the letter from the Plaintiffâs solicitors in September 2005 before the commencement of this action, sheconsciously gave no instruction to her then solicitors to reply, as she said she did not want to incur legal costs.  She did notconcede that until during trial.  Her explanation that she came to be aware of her mistake only after her lawyers explained to herwith reference to Accountancy textbook and materials prior to the trial was just incredible.  Even if that were true, Mr. Wong forthe Defendant confirmed that still no indication of such concession had been conveyed to the Plaintiff prior to the commencementof the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  <i>Gatley</i> (at para.32.42) has this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">As malice can be inferred from the defendantâs conduct at any time, whether before or after publication, his actions during thecourse of litigation, and his demeanour and attitude at trial, <b>may well be believed to have existed at the time when the words were published</b>.

The same approach should be adopted as regards persisting,unsuccessfully, with the plea of justification at trial: of itself, such conduct is not evidence of malice, but a jury may infermalice if the defendant refuses to withdraw the defence at trial having called no evidence to support, or it is abundantly plainthat the defamatory statement is untrue.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Answers given by the defendant in the course of his evidence at trial, and his demeanour in the witness box, displaying, e.g. overthostility towards the plaintiff, can be urged upon the jury as indicating malice.  <b>So too, that the defendant has lied whilst giving evidence, but some caution should be exercised before basing a finding of maliceon these grounds.</b>â</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">(emphasis added)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  The Defendantâs refusal to acknowledge her mistaken belief about the Plaintiff after the same should be discovered reinforcesmy impression that she was subjective and stubborn.

She merely intended that Shiota could consult Cheung if necessary on Nelvâs accounting matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  From Nelvâs point of view, Cheung was an outsider.  I wonder how Shiota would find it appropriate to consult Cheung on the companyâsaccounting matters while at the same time retaining the Plaintiff as the auditor.  For convenience in communication in Japanese,there were staff members of Nelv who managed to do that and there was no indication of communication problem for the past years. From Cheungâs point of view, he might be willing to assist the Defendant on a friendly basis.  However I saw no reason for himto agree to assist Shiota on an ad hoc basis without a view to a retainer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  The development proves my observation.  The Defendant introduced Cheung to Shiota in early June 2005, i.e., after her alleged discoveryof the accumulated accounting problems.  The 17 June E-mail followed.  In the e-mail, after stating her criticism of the Plaintiff,the Defendant concluded by advising Shiota to âconsiderâ the Plaintiff as the auditor.  This was suggestive of considerationof the appropriateness of the Plaintiff as the auditor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In reply to the Plaintiffâs letter to the Defendant dated 30 June 2005, Shiota signed the letter dated 4 July 2005 purportingto be Nelvâs reply.  It sought to explain that there was only a misunderstanding and no criticism of the Plaintiff was meant. According to Shiota, that was not his idea but that of the Defendant with the assistance of Cheung.  More importantly, the replycould not genuinely mean what it said because on the same day, Cheung issued on behalf of Yâs a quotation to Nelv for company secretarialservice, tax return submission and auditing with a view to replacing the Plaintiff.  Shiota signed on this quotation.  Yâs, byitself and through Yip, also informed the Plaintiff of the replacement subsequently.  Yip attended the stocktaking at Nelv soon afterwards.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  The Defendant said it was eventually Shiota who decided to replace the Plaintiff against her advice and without prior notice toher.  Shiota denied that.  Whichever the case was, it can hardly be denied that the Defendantâs criticism about the Plaintiff musthave influenced Shiota before he decided to engage Yâs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  I have no reservation that the Defendant introduced Yâs with the motive by the time of the E-mails that Shiota could considerYâs as a replacement of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Was that improper motive?  In my view, introducing Yâs or even promoting Yâs to Shiota as a replacement of the Plaintiff <i>per se</i> would not be considered to be improper motive.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The Plaintiff asked me to consider the other circumstances surrounding the replacement of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Suspicion had once been raised about Yâs, which is not a CPA firm registered in Hong Kong.  It is apparently a member of an internationaltax consultancy group.  There was insufficient basis to query the legitimacy of Yâs providing such accounting and auditing servicesthrough associates such as Yip who is a registered CPA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The Plaintiff pointed out that Yâs quoted a higher fee than that charged by him for the same services.  Counsel for both partiesalso did their own comparison of the fees charged by the Plaintiff with that quoted by Yâs.  In my view, conclusion could not bedrawn simply from whether one would be charging more than the other for similar services particularly when the difference actuallyshown was not remarkable and could vary from year to year.  Likewise, I would not conclude that causing Nelv to pay a higher feefor another auditorâs service to the extent shown in the circumstances was a manifestation of the Defendantâs motive to jeopardisethe company (financially) as alleged by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  According to his statement, Shiota believed that the Defendant engineered the replacement of the Plaintiff by Yâs so that shecould be subject to the least monitoring.  This implied possible collusion between Yâs and the Defendant.  This suggestion wasnot borne out by the evidence at all.  Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff in his submission seemed to accept that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  What at one point of time caused me some concern was the Defendantâs introduction of a couple of strangers to Shiota.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Shiota changed his mind about the replacement of auditor after his meeting with a Chinese man whom he said the Defendant introducedto him.  The man had not left behind any business card and Shiota could not recall his name.  The man informed him of a possiblefinancial penalty imposed by the IRD for the consecutive qualified annual reports.  This man lastly offered to assist at a fee. What might lend weight to Shiotaâs evidence about this meeting was that he distinctly remembered that the Defendant arranged thatmeeting on a Saturday.  As a result, he actually consulted the Plaintiff and Cheung separately on the following working day or soregarding whether the financial penalty would be imposed as he was told.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  The Defendant denied knowledge about such meeting.  In the meeting on 29 July 2005, the Plaintiff attended the office of Nelv atthe request of Shiota.  The proceeding was audio-recorded.  When confronted about the meeting between Shiota and the mysterious Chineseman, the Defendant refused to answer, saying that the Plaintiff was not the auditor of Nelv.  Upon Shiotaâs confirmation of theretention of the Plaintiff, she tendered her resignation.  The Plaintiff believed that she was avoiding having to answer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Though I am inclined to accept what Shiota said, this episode involving the Chinese man remained largely a mystery.  Shiota saidthat he then believed that the Chinese man was from Yâs.  But he also said that he subsequently consulted Cheung about this andCheung actually confirmed that there was no basis for the alleged financial penalty.  Mr. Wong for the Defendant submitted that hadthat Chinese man been associated with Yâs, Cheungâs response to Shiotaâs such enquiry would probably have been different. I tend to agree.  There was no suggestion that either Yip or Cheung had given any suspicious advice to Shiota on Nelvâs companyaffairs.  This contrasted with this episode involving this unknown Chinese man.  In this connection, there was insufficient evidenceto implicate Yâs or Cheung.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  The Defendant also introduced a Thomas Tang (<b>âTangâ</b>) to Shiota on 28 July, the day before the confrontation between her and the Plaintiff.  According to the Defendant, she introducedTang to Shiota after receipt of the letter from the Plaintiffâs solicitors dated 25 July 2005.  Tang was a friend who she understoodto have studied Law.  She asked him to help explain in English on her behalf to Shiota.  Mr. Wong for the Defendant pointed out thatthere was no suggestion of any impropriety or solicitation of advantage by Tang.  This episode also did not develop into anything. There was also no evidence of any connection between Tang and Yâs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Considering the evidence, I am not prepared to conclude that on the basis of the Defendantâs then belief about the Plaintiff (thoughwrong), her introduction of Yâs as a potential replacement of the Plaintiff was due to any other surrounding circumstances an impropermotive.  The Plaintiff therefore fails to overcome this hurdle of proving malice on the part of the Defendant at the time of thepublication of the defamatory statements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">CONCLUSION</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  For the above reasons, I find that the Defendant remained under the cover of the defence of qualified privilege.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">COMPENSATION</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  For completeness, I proceed to consider compensation assuming I am wrong above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed an injunction restraining the Defendant from publishing the defamatory statements as well as damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Injunction</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  As to the injunction prayed for, I see no suggestion that the Defendant ever intended to publish the defamatory statements sincethey had been made.  There is no basis or need for granting such relief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Damages</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  The pleaded basis for claiming damages was the damage to the reputation and the alleged considerable distress and embarrassmentcaused to the Plaintiff.  General damages is compensatory and in cases of libel and slander actionable per se, the law presumes damagearising from the publication and the claimant is entitled to look to an award of damages sufficient to vindicate his reputation accordingto (1) the seriousness of the defamation, (2) the range of its publication and (3) the extent to which the defendant has persistedwith the charge: see <i>Gatley</i> at para.9.2.  The objective is to restore the plaintiff, as far as money can do, to the position he would have been in if the torthad not been committed: <i>Hung Yuen Chan Robert v Hongkong Standard Newspaper Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 HKC 519.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff referred me to numerous authorities with a view to giving me some idea about the appropriate level ofdamages to be awarded.  Those were cases since the 1980âs, carrying awards from a few thousand to tens of thousand.  The courtin <i>Hung Yuen Chan Robert</i> (above) (at 536G-H) remarked that the circumstances of each libel are likely to differ and the factors to be taken into account dependon the facts of each individual case, it would be difficult to extrapolate from previous awards unless there are significant similarities. Indeed I find the cases cited to me differ substantially from the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  To begin with, the publication of the defamatory statements and its effect in the present case was basically kept within a relativelylimited group of persons.  In saying that his reputation as a professional accountant or auditor was damaged, the Plaintiff was referringto his reputation in the eyes of Mok and Shiota specifically.  Such damage should be manifested by the attitude of Shiota and Moktowards the Plaintiff as a professional and auditor as a result of the defamation.  Both of them have queried but soon retained thePlaintiffâs service.  They have stood by him so much so that they came forward to testify for him.  Essentially any doubt Shiotaand Mok might have about the Plaintiff, and therefore the lowering of the Plaintiffâs reputation in their eyes as well as the Plaintiffâsembarrassment have been short lived.  The Plaintiff felt embarrassed and being wronged at a certain point but I do not have the impressionthat there has been significant distress and embarrassment as suggested.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  The Plaintiff prayed for exemplary damages.  Exemplary damages are awarded on a more restricted basis.  This was punitive in naturefor the defendantâs wilful commission of a tort with a view to material gain: see <i>Gatley</i> at paras.9.15-9.17.  However in his submissions, Mr. Wong for the Plaintiff did not actually ask for exemplary damages.  Instead,he asked for aggravated damages.  Claim for aggravated damages can be justified by the conduct of the defendant including failureto apologise or to withdraw the defamatory statement, conduct calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding, persistence by wayof prolonged or hostile cross examination of the plaintiff, maintaining a plea of justification which is bound to fail or any conductcalculated to attract wide publicity: <i>Sutcliff v Pressdram Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20QB%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 QB 153</a> at 184; <i>Lee Ching</i> (above).  In the light of how I view the conduct of the defence above, I would have made an award of aggravated damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  It was pleaded that the Plaintiff has expended substantial time and effort to clarify the matters and to clear his professionalname before he could salvage the retainers with Mokâs company and especially Nelv.  According to his evidence in court, he hadspent not less than 1,000 hours on this case including 1 to 2 hours each day during the last 2 years.  This might have been claimedas actual loss suffered by the Plaintiff.  However, in absence of proper quantification and evidence, I would not have been preparedto award special damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  The Plaintiff rationally suggested during his evidence that he had not expected that the matter would have had to proceed beyondthe time when he wrote to the Defendant in June and July 2005 to demand an explanation and nominal costs.  Considering all the factors,I am of the view that justice would have been served by an award of damages and aggravated damages each in sum of HK$10,000 and HK$10,000,or a total of HK$20,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">COSTS</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim fails.  Should costs follow the event?  I have no doubt that they should not, in the circumstances of thiscase.  Considering how the Defendant came to publish her defamatory statements as well as the various untenable positions which shemaintained until after the commencement of the trial, I am of the view that discretion should be exercised in favour of a costs orderwhich would reflect my disapproval of such deplorable conduct.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  I therefore order that the claim be dismissed but the Defendant shall bear half of the Plaintiffâs costs of this action, includingany costs reserved.  Such costs shall be taxed, if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.  The order is nisi and would becomeabsolute in the absence of application in 14 days from today.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Simon Leung<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Representation :</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr. Wong Po Wing instructed by Messrs.
