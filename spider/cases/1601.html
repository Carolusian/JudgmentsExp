This is an appeal from that decision.  The facts are perfectly straightforward. The Plaintiff is an enrolled nurse who was employed in the psychiatric unit at Kwai Chung Hospital when on 6 December 2001, he wasassaulted by a psychiatric patient.  There was also a further assault on him on Christmas Day 2001 by another patient.  As a resultof both of these incidents, the Plaintiff sustained physical injuries and became psychiatrically unwell for which he now claims damages.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The history of the litigation needs to be examined, with some care, with particular reference to the conduct of the Plaintiffâsthen solicitors.  The starting point to all of this is that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, being the Director of Health [represented by the Secretary for Justice] was the Plaintiffâs employer.  The Directorof Health is sued in negligence and for breach of statutory duty under the Occupierâs Liability Ordinance.  The HA has the managementand control of the Hospital and as such is an obvious party to join as a defendant in an action of this sort.  It is therefore highlyrelevant to see what steps were taken on the Plaintiffâs behalf.</p>    <p class="heading">Chronology</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 9 June 2003, the Plaintiff was given legal aid to prosecute a claim for employeesâ compensation and to bring a common law actionfor damages.  On 3 July 2003, his solicitors wrote a letter before action to the HA so that it might investigate the proposed commonlaw claim against it as contemplated by the Personal Injury Practice Direction.  On 22 July 2003, the solicitors issued an applicationfor employeeâs compensation against the Director of Health as employer.  On 21 August 2003, the solicitors for the HA wrote tothe Plaintiffâs solicitors asking for further documents to enable them to consider the damages claim.  Those documents were suppliedon 30 August 2003.  Between early September 2003 and 1 November 2003, 11 further letters were exchanged between the solicitors, mostlyin relation to the appointment of joint medical experts to examine and prepare reports on the Plaintiff.  Between July and August2004, there was further correspondence in relation to the exchange of an orthopaedic report.  On 16 November 2004, a writ was issuedagainst the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant [the Director of Health] only.  On 19 November 2004, the Plaintiffâs solicitors wrote to the HAâs solicitors informingthem that a writ had been issued against its client and that they were withholding service in order to save costs.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  I pause here to consider the extraordinary oversight by the Plaintiffâs then solicitors, which in the event was causative of thelimitation period against the HA being allowed to expire.  It now seems perfectly clear that they did not realize that they had notin fact issued the writ against the HA, but only against the Director of Health, although, given what had happened in correspondencebeforehand, it must always have been their intention to sue the HA.  The letter [page 161] is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â<u>Common Law Claim HCPI 1036/2004<br />         Plaintiff: Li Chi Hung, Lawrance</u></i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>We refer to the above action.  Please be informed that we have issued a holding writ in view of the time bar in respect of the accidentsoccurred on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2001 and 25<sup>th</sup> December 2001.  Since the employeesâ compensation claim (DCEC 803/2003) is still proceeded and has not determined yet, we suggestto withhold service of the above action for the time being for the purpose to save costs on all parties.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>Please let us have your confirmation to our suggestionâ¦.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>In this letter, they were addressing themselves to the HAâs solicitors who were not the Director of Healthâs solicitors who wereopposing them in the employeesâ compensation proceedings which were still going on.  Mr Sakhrani, who appears for the HA, has commentedthat what had probably happened, for such a basic error to have been made, was that the Plaintiffâs solicitors had simply not takenthe obvious precaution of reading their case file carefully, otherwise, they would have immediately observed that they had in factnot issued the writ against the HA.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In the event, the HAâs solicitors remained silent, as they were entitled to, on the matter.  On 6 December 2004, the Plaintiffâssolicitors asked the Director of Legal Aid to assign counsel to the case and on 17 December 2004 wrote again to the HAâs solicitorsregarding the appointment with its psychiatric expert scheduled for February 2005.  Counsel for the Plaintiff was assigned by theDirector of Legal Aid who was formally instructed by the solicitors on 1 February 2005.  By then, of course, the limitation periodagainst the HA had expired in respect of both incidents.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Counsel advised, very promptly, on 4 February 2005, that the HA should also be sued.  He had obviously spotted the error that hadbeen made.  On 7 February that advice was implemented by the solicitors, albeit procedurally incorrectly, by amending the writ tojoin the HA and serving it on the HA.  In the absence of the requisite leave having been obtained, the HA took out a summons on 24March to strike out the joinder and on 11 April the Plaintiffâs summons was issued to dis-apply the limitation period which wasdismissed by Master Au-Yeung on 12 September, hence this appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issues</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  This matter raises two distinct issues.  Firstly, whether in the circumstances [the circumstances being the Plaintiffâs then solicitors,plain and glaring error in not spotting that they had not sued the HA when they issued the writ on 16 November 2004 until after theyhad received counselâs advice on 4 February 2005 following the expiry of the limitation period] the Plaintiff is now able to invokethe courtâs jurisdiction under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> which in the event of him not being able to do so his summons must fail <i>in limine</i>, leaving him with his recourse against his then solicitors for having allowed the limitation period to expire in the circumstanceswhich I have just described. If he is able to engage <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a>, the next issue is whether, in all the circumstances, the court should exercise its discretion in his favour to dis-apply the limitationperiod and allow the amended writ to proceed.</p>    <p class="heading">Does <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> apply to circumstances such as these?</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Of the two issues, this is the more difficult, raising as it does the interesting question of whether the principle in <i>Walkley v Precision Forgings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR 606</a> H.L. is intended to extend to a case such as this, where a writ has been issued in timely fashion against one appropriate defendantbut through a very obvious error on the part of the Plaintiffâs solicitors it has not included another obvious defendant who isnow sought to be joined after the expiry of the limitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  For the purposes of this issue, the relevant part of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â(1)   If it appears to the court that it would be equitable to allow an action to proceed having regard to the degree to whichâ¦.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"><i>(a)     the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> [or 28] prejudices the plaintiff or any person whom he represents â¦.â</i></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> being the section establishing the 3-year limitation period in personal injury cases.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is convenient to take first the HAâs argument that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> has not prejudiced the Plaintiff and that therefore <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> can have no applicability to his circumstances.  This submission comes from the House of Lordsâ decision in <i>Walkley v Precision Forgings supra</i>.  The facts of that case can be shortly stated.  The plaintiff who had contracted an industrial disease in the course of his employmentsued his employers.  Having served the writ, no statement of claim was served following the defendantsâ appearance to the writbecause the plaintiffâs solicitors had advised him that he did not have a good claim.  He then consulted other solicitors who informedthe defendants that they intended to proceed with the claim.  The defendantsâ insurers replied that if they intended to proceed,a summons would be issued to dismiss the action for want of prosecution.  No summons was in fact issued, but it was conceded on behalfof the plaintiff that had an application been made, the action was liable to have been dismissed.  Subsequently, the plaintiff consultedanother firm of solicitors [his third] who issued a fresh writ starting a second action asserting the same cause of action as hadbeen asserted in the original writ.  The defendantsâ solicitors issued a summons to have the action struck out.  The Master madethe order.  The Judge in Chambers allowed the plaintiffâs appeal and restored the action on the plaintiffâs solicitors undertakingto discontinue the first action.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendantsâ appeal who then appealed to the House of Lords. The House of Lords allowed the appeal and restored the Masterâs order striking out the action.  Lord Wilberforce explained thematter in this way;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âThe provisions of section 2A are those which require an action for personal injuries to be brought within three years.  So subsection(1)(a) must be contemplating a case in which, because the three years have expired without an action being brought, section 2A appliesto the prejudice of the plaintiff.  But if the plaintiff has brought his action within the three years, how has he been prejudicedby section 2A?  This I fail to understand.  If this argument is sound, the respondentâs case fails in limine.  He brought thisaction within the normal limitation period, and if he has suffered any prejudice, it is by his own inaction and not by the operationof the Act.â (page 609D-E)</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Diplock at page 618E expressed it in this way;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â... section 2D applies only to actions which it is sought to start after the relevant primary limitation period has expired.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Sakhrani submits that this is precisely the case here.  The Plaintiff has started his action timeously against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and his failure to join the HA has been caused by the conduct of his then solicitors in not amending the writ in time. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff has been prejudiced by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a>, but only by his solicitorsâ failure to join the HA in time.  Mr Sakhrani has also referred to other cases in England as well asone in Hong Kong where <i>Walkley</i> has been followed.  In <i>Liff v Peasley &amp; Anr.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 781</a> C.A., a plaintiff who was injured when a motor car in which he was a passenger was involved with in a collision with another vehiclesued the driver of the other car as 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, two independent witnesses saying that it was he who had been responsible for the collision.  That driver was subsequentlyconvicted of careless driving.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs solicitors repudiated liability and informed the Motor Insurers Bureau that they had done so.  The insurers instructedother insurers to act on their behalf and that company sought to bring in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant into the action so that if a finding of negligence was made against him, the plaintiff could recover damages through theinsurers indemnifying the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  After the expiry of the limitation period, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant delivered his defence claiming that the collision was caused wholly or partly by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs negligence.  The plaintiff applied ex parte to the Master two years after the expiry of the limitation period for anorder joining the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the action.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant then applied to have the claim against him struck out as being time-barred.  The judge refused to do so, but the Courtof Appeal, allowing the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs appeal, held that as an established rule of practice, the court would not permit a person to be included as a defendantto an action at a time when he could rely on a period of limitation barring the plaintiff from bringing a fresh action against him. In coming to its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not discuss in any detail the effect of <i>Walkley</i> to the facts of the case before it.  It decided the appeal on the propriety of the purported joinder of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under RSC Ord. 15 r. 6(2) after the expiry of the limitation period.  For this reason, I find this case of only limitedassistance.  I say this notwithstanding the reference at 788H-789A in the judgment of Stephenson L.J. when he said;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âI am first not satisfied that the provisions of section 2A [our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27]</a> have prejudiced the plaintiff to any degree, so the condition required by section 2D(1)(a) for exercising the discretion is not fulfilled:compare Walkley v Precision Forgings Ltd.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>That is the only reference to the case in his judgment and it gets no mention at all in the judgment of Brandon L.J. (as he then was). The result here really turned on whether the joinder post-expiry of the limitation period was valid.  The <i>Walkley</i> principle was not the issue that appears to have been at the forefront of the courtâs consideration, hence what was only a passingreference to it.  Nevertheless, Mr Sakhrani places strong reliance on <i>Liff v Peasley</i> as a case where an application which was identical to the one before me failed.  A case concerning anextant original action validlybrought where a 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was sought to be joined after the expiry of the limitation period against him.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  A case in which <i>Walkley</i> was applied is <i>Young decd v Western Power Distribution (SW) PLC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%201%20WLR%202868" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) 1 WLR 2868</a>, where the claimantâs husband had begun, within the time-limit, an action for personal injury against the defendants but then discontinuedthe action.  Following his death, and outside the limitation period, his widow and executrix began another action against the defendantsbased on the same cause of action.  The trial judge dis-applied the time bar and allowed the second action to proceed.  He was reversedin the Court of Appeal on the basis that since the action had been started timeously by the deceased, his widow was therefore notprejudiced by the limitation period and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33</a> could not be used to dis-apply the limitation provisions.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  A similar conclusion was arrived at by Master Jones in Hong Kong in <i>Wong Hak Lai v Kwok Shun</i>, HCA No. A.11302/93 in identical circumstances, where original proceedings had been started within the primary limitation period. The learned Master held, following <i>Walkley</i> that no prejudice had been sustained by virtue of the limitation period and therefore there was no basis for bringing <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> into play.  A similar conclusion was also arrived at, on <i>Walkley</i> principles by Gray J. in a libel action, <i>Wilkley &amp; Anr. v BBC &amp; Anr. unreported</i> QBD CF 202327.  These cases show, says Mr Sakhrani, that the crucial feature is the start of the first action timeously which wouldhave the effect of removing an application such as this from the ambit of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30.</a></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr Dennis Law, for the Plaintiff, says that in <i>Walkley</i> is simply not available to the HA.  <i>Walkley</i> and the cases that follow it all related to the fate of a second time-barred action after the first one had been discontinued ordismissed.  Here, he says, is a perfectly good existing action in which the Plaintiff now seeks to bring in a second, now time-barred,defendant.  Reference has also been made to <i>Shapland v Palmer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%201%20WLR%202068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 1 WLR 2068</a> C.A., where the Court of Appeal in England held that <i>Walkley</i> only caught cases where the second action involved the same defendant and the same cause of action.  In <i>Shapland v Palmer</i>, the plaintiff sued the employers of a driver in whose car she was travelling as a passenger when it was struck by another vehicleas a result of which she was injured.  The driver was driving in the course of her employment.  She sued the employer by issuinga writ on the last day before the expiry of the limitation period, but did not serve the proceedings with the result that in duecourse the action was struck out.  Subsequently, she started a time-barred action against the driver herself.  The judge refusedto dis-apply the limitation period, but on appeal, the Court of Appeal held that <i>Walkley</i> only applied to a second action against the same defendant and the same cause of action.  This was not such a case because an actionagainst a personal defendant was not the same cause of action as one alleging vicarious liability on the part of a principal or anemployer and that in the circumstances, the court should exercise its discretion in the plaintiffâs favour and allow her actionagainst the defendant to proceed.  Simon Brown L.J. (as he then was) at 2073C-D observed that a line of cases [the McEvoy line ofauthority] where the issue of the first writ had been held to be ineffective;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>ââ¦ suggest a marked unwillingness on the courtâs part to apply the Walkley case unless it is plainly indistinguishable.  Secondly,they appear to suggest that if the second action is brought against a different party then it is not caught by the Walkley principle.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>It had been submitted to him that the difference between this action and the one against the employer was a narrow one, the sole differencebetween the two being the identity of the defendant.  The tort in both cases was identical.  Both tortfeasors were covered by thesame policy of insurance and there was never in fact any issue as to whether the company was vicariously liable.  Brown L.J. rejectedthis argument.  He said at 2073H-2074A:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âBy the same token that the Walkley principle itself rests upon a narrow and somewhat technical construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33</a>, so too it is, in my judgment, possible to escape it on just such grounds.  That moreover is particularly appropriate given the undoubtedanomalies that in any event arise from the application of the principle â most notably, as already pointed out, its failure toimpact on cases of perhaps greater negligence where no writ was ever issued in the first place.  I would accordingly rule that the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33</a> discretion arises in all cases save those which fall four square with the Walkley principle.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  This was further elaborated on by Clarke L.J. (as he then was) who was of the view that;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>ââ¦ the decision in the Walkley case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 W.L.R. 606</a> should be confined to its own facts and not extended in the manner suggested by Mr. James, especially having regard to the anomalywhich derives from the Walkley case which Lord Diplock described as follows in Thompson v. Brown  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20744" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 744</a>, 752-753:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âIt may seem anomalous that a defendant should be better off where, unknown to him, a writ has been issued but not served than hewould be if the writ had not been issued at all; but this is a consequence of the greater anomaly too well-established for this Houseto abolish that, for the purposes of a limitation period, an action is brought when a writ or other originating process is issuedâ¦ and not when it is brought to the knowledge of the defendant by service upon him.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>It appears to me that another reason for the anomaly is the view of causation taken by the House in the Walkley case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 W.L.R. 606</a>, but whatever the reason for it, the anomaly should not be extended except for very good reason.  I agree with Simon Brown L.J. thatthere are a number of reasons (which he has set out) for not extending it to a second action brought against a different defendant. There is no need to do so in order to ensure that justice is done between the parties because that can be achieved by the applicationof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33(1)</a>, which gives the court power to disapply <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 11</a> if it is equitable to do so, and the court is enjoined by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33(3)</a> to have regard o all the circumstances of the case.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It may be said that Brown L.J. appears to have retreated somewhat from his judgment in <i>Shapland v Palmer</i> in the subsequent case of <i>Young decd v Western Power Distribution (SW) PLC supra</i>, but it seems perfectly clear as Brown L.J. has said in <i>Young decdâs</i> case that <i>Shapland v Palmer</i> turned on the fact that the second action had been brought against a different party and not against the same defendant. A similarconclusion to <i>Shapland</i> was arrived at by Arden L.J. in <i>Piggott v Aulton decd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%20RTR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) RTR 540</a> where a second action was brought out of time against the estate of the deceased where for somewhat technical reasons, she held thatthe first timeous action, subsequently discontinued, had not been brought against the same defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Unsurprisingly therefore, Mr Law has placed very strong reliance on this line of authority stemming from the <i>McEvoy</i> cases.  Here, he says, is a situation of a wholly different defendant which he seeks to join and this being so, I am able to distinguishor, at all events, not follow <i>Walkley</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It seems to me that Mr Law is right here.  I propose to say that <i>Walkley</i> is to be construed as being limited to cases where the same defendant is sought to be sued following the expiry of the limitationperiod after the disposition of the original action by discontinuance or dismissal for want of prosecution.  In coming to this conclusion,I have been concerned by the fact that the case of <i>Liff v Peasley &amp; Anr.</i>, to which I have already made some reference, should persuade me otherwise, it being a case like this one where it had been soughtto join a different defendant outside the limitation period to a valid and extant action.  But, having read the judgments, it isclear to me that the court was far more concerned with the technical argument under Ord. 15 r. 6 as to whether the joinder had beenproper under that order and this is amply confirmed by the many cases referred to in the judgments which bore on that issue. I amcontent to say that the analysis in <i>Shapland v Palmer</i> is the one that I should follow.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> applies to these circumstances and that I am therefore now able to proceed and decide whether it is equitable to allow the joinderof the HA having regard to all the factors referred to in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30(3).</a></p>    <p class="heading">The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30(3)</a> discretion</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In exercising what is an unfettered discretion, I am specifically required to have regard to all the circumstances of the case andin particular to the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â(a) the length of, and the reasons for, the delay on the part of the plaintiff;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(b) the extent to which, having regard to the delay, the evidence adduced or likely to be adduced by the plaintiff or the defendantis or is likely to be less cogent than if the action had been brought within the time allowed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a>, as the case may be;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(c) the conduct of the defendant after the cause of action arose, including the extent, if any, to which he responded to requestsreasonably made by the plaintiff for information or inspection for the purpose of ascertaining facts which were or might be relevantto the plaintiffâs cause of action against the defendant;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(d) the duration of any disability of the plaintiff arising after the date of the accrual of the cause of action;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(e) the extent to which the plaintiff acted promptly and reasonably once he knew whether or not the act or omission of the defendant,to which the injury was attributable, might be capable at that time of giving rise to an action for damages;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(f) the steps, if any taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or other expert advice and the nature of any such advice hemay have received.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Sakhrani submits that on a proper exercise of the discretion I should not dis-apply the limitation period.  The burden restson the applicant to satisfy the court that it should show an exceptional indulgence.  The burden is a heavy one.  See <i>KR &amp; Others v Bryn Alyn Community (Holding) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%20QB%201441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) QB 1441.</a> In this regard, the case of <i>Long v Tolchard &amp; Son Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%20PIQR%20P18" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) PIQR P18</a> is of particular assistance. I should not reach a decision effectively concluding on the matter on the strength of any one of thecircumstances specified in the sub-section, nor on one of any other circumstances relevant to my decision, without regard to allof the issues in the case.  I should conduct the balancing exercise at the end of my analysis of all the relevant circumstances andwith regard to all the issues, taking them all into account.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It seems perfectly obvious that the delay [8 weeks and 6 weeks] which is not especially significant in this case will cause no forensicprejudice to the HA who have been âin the loopâ from the start.  This factor relates to items (a) and (b) in the list of considerations.It has been involved in this as if it had been the original defendant.  So much appears from the correspondence to which I have alreadymade reference.  It is perfectly obvious that it expected to be a defendant from the outset and had been treated as such by the Plaintiffâsthen solicitors.  The only reason that this is not so is the monumental oversight, to put it at its kindest, by the Plaintiffâssolicitors who issued a writ apparently not realising that they had not in fact sued the most obvious Defendant in this litigation,being the HA.  I will return to this feature as a ârelevant circumstanceâ presently.  The HA will have been in a position toinvestigate this claim from the beginning of July 2003 when it received the letter before action.  In this regard, the question ofthe length of delay and prejudice, or lack of it, heavily favours the Plaintiff in the balancing exercise.  As to the reasons forthe delay also referred to as a particular matter to which regard should be had is the Plaintiffâs then solicitorsâ inexcusableoversight, this factor must weigh in the HAâs favour which I will further consider when I deliberate on the effects of that oversightin the round as part of the balancing exercise.  The conduct of the HA after the cause of action arose has been exemplary in co-operatingthroughout in the expectation that a writ would be issued against it by dealing with correspondence promptly and being accommodatingon the question of the instruction of the medical experts.  This is consideration (c) which weighs in the HAâs favour.  Item (d)is not applicable and items (e) and (f) favour the Plaintiff in the sense that but for allowing the limitation period to lapse inthe way that they did, the Plaintiffâs then solicitors appear to have gone about the litigation against the Director of Healthand the HA with reasonable competence.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Sakhrani lays great stress on what he characterises as the Plaintiffâs then solicitorsâ unmitigated negligence in overlookingthe fact that they had not noticed that the writ had not been issued against the HA and says that this must be a particularly weightyfactor in the exercise of the discretion.  If the Plaintiff fails in this application, he has a cast-iron negligence claim to fallback on against the solicitors.  Why, he asks rhetorically, should the solicitors enjoy a windfall at the expense of the HA for notdoing their job properly?  Burrell J. in <i>Wu Kwok Biu v Chan Ho Sun unreported 496/98</i> held that when faced with the issue of solicitors who are likely to be held to be negligent for causing a claim to become irremediablytime-barred the court in weighing this factor should have regard to all other matters first.  He said;</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âIf having considered all other matters, the court decides that it would indeed be equitable for the litigation to proceed, thenthe vulnerable position in which the Plaintiffâs solicitors find themselves is of no concern.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Sakhrani says that this approach is no longer consonant with the tougher approach now exhibited by the courts.  Nevertheless, insaying what he did Burrell J. was applying what Lord Denning MR had said in <i>Firman v Ellis</i> (1978) 1QB 905<i>:</i></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>ââ¦ there were negotiations for a settlement, but the plaintiffâs solicitors, by the merest slip, allowed time to run out.  Theyfailed to renew the writ in time.  This slip did not prejudice the defendant or his insurers in the least.  Yet as soon as the defendantâsinsurers discovered it, they cried âsnapâ and broke off the negotiations.  They said to the plaintiff: âYou are statute-barred. We are not liable.  You sue your own solicitors for negligence.  Make their insurers pay.  And not us. â¦  As a matter of simplejustice, it is the defendantâs insurers who should pay the plaintiffâs claim.  They have received the premiums to cover the riskto these accidents.  They should not be allowed to foist their liability on to the plaintiffâs solicitors or their insurers bycalling âsnapâ as if it were a game of cards.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Burrell J. recognised that the alternative remedy against the solicitors can be a relevant consideration.  In weighing this factorless heavily than Mr Sakhrani says that he ought to have done he followed Denning MRâs further observation in <i>Firman v Ellis</i>  which was that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âIn case under the Limitation Act 1975, I think that the negligence of the plaintiffâs solicitor â and a remedy against himâ is an admissible consideration.  It is one of âthe circumstances of the caseâ and one of âthe reasons for the delay.â It may tip the scale where the defendant has been substantially prejudiced by the delay.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>For my part, I propose to adopt, as Burrell J. had done, the Master of the Rolls approach to this feature and assess it the way thatBurrell J. had done in the passage from his judgment, which I have just cited.  And in the weighing exercise, I propose to have regardto the fact that the delay caused by any negligence on the part of the solicitors has been short and has not caused any real prejudiceto the HA, let alone substantial prejudice, which Denning MR referred to.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Another factor that Mr Sakhrani has drawn attention to is what he says is the Plaintiffâs weak case against the HA.  He has referredto decided cases which he says bears this out.  It is impossible for the court at this very preliminary stage to form anything beyonda highly provisional view of the merits.  In my judgment, the Plaintiff must on these facts have at least a reasonably arguable casethat the HA has been negligent.  Had Mr Sakhrani been able to point to a fairly obvious âloserâ then I might have been able togive this significant weight.  Where I am unable to accept this part of his submission I am not prepared to put this part of hisargument into the scales in the HAâs favour.  This is an authentic claim which, other things being equal, ought to be allowed tobe investigated by the court.</p>    <p class="heading">The result</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I have sought to demonstrate how the various factors come into play in this matter and the respective weight that each must attractin the balancing exercise.  I am convinced that where this is not an unexpected claim by the Plaintiff against the HA, on the contraryit was expecting to be sued and that it has suffered no prejudice by the delay, it would be equitable for the limitation period tobe dis-applied in these circumstances.  I will do so with the result that the appeal must be allowed and the Plaintiff can now havehis order joining the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  I would expect that his present solicitors would now wish to bring this matter forward to trial as soon as they reasonablycan.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Notwithstanding the outcome, I would have thought that the appropriate order should be HAâs costs in any event.  The Plaintiffhas had to make this application.  The HA has defended it on perfectly respectable grounds.  The usual rule is âhe who is latepaysâ and I would have thought that the Plaintiff will have no difficulty whatsoever in getting a reimbursement of the costs thathe must pay to the HA on this occasion from his then solicitors who after all have put him into the position of having to make thisapplication.  I would have thought that those solicitors can have no answer to such a claim.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  There will also be Legal Aid Taxation of the Plaintiffâs costs.  The order for costs will be an order nisi.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Ian Carlson)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Dennis Law, instructed by Messrs Adrian Yeung &amp; Cheng, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Ashok Sakhrani, instructed by Messrs Cheng, Yeung &amp; Company, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2006/25.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
