Two of the decisions also concern officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force andthe Civil Aid Services.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Relief is sought by way of certiorari to quash those decisions and for an order of mandamus to release the applicants with consequentialdeclarations.

An application by the applicants to cross-examine Mr K.C. Cheukof the Immigration Department and Mr K.F.

However, from the 2nd July 1982,the Government introduced a policy of closed centres whereby all former residents of Vietnam who were given permission to remainin Hong Kong as refugees pending resettlement elsewhere were detained in closed centres. Prior to the 16th June 1988, all formerresidents of Vietnam who arrived directly from Vietnam were given permission to remain in Hong Kong as refugees without having toundergo a refugee status determination. On arrival, the refugees were informed of this policy and that they had the right to leavein which case assistance might be given to them. Some Vietnamese migrants have in fact, upon interception chosen to move on in preferenceto claiming asylum in Hong Kong. A copy of a warning notice that was read to the refugees upon arrival exhibit CL-1, was as follows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">                "         All former residents of Vietnam seeking to enter Hong Kong since 2 July 1982 are detained in special centres.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">                         If you do not leave Hong Kong now, you will be taken to a closed centre and detained there indefinitely.You will not be permitted to leave detention during the time you remain in Hong Kong. It is extremely unlikely that any opportunityfor resettlement will be forthcoming.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">         You are free to leave Hong Kong now, and if you choose to continue your journey you will be given assistance to do so."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> From 1982 until 1987, an average of about 2,000 new arrivals entered Hong Kong each year, but in 1986 there was a large influx ofrefugees when a total of 18,328 arrived. A further 34,114 arrived in 1989. From 1982 until 1990, total arrivals amounted to 79,324whilst 42,287 were re-settled and 6,387 were repatriated.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> As a result of this large influx, the policy of Government changed as from the 16th June 1988 when all Vietnamese migrants were treatedas illegal immigrants unless given permission to remain as refugees under a screening procedure pending resettlement. This led toa new notice, exhibit CL-2, being read to new arrivals which was as follows :-</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="quote">                "There is a new policy in force in Hong Kong.</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">                Former residents of Vietnam seeking to enter Hong Kong are now treated as illegal immigrants on arrival.               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">                You are free to leave Hong Kong.

Further, since the middle of 1988, Government has attempted to discourage the exodus from Vietnam by broadcastingradio announcements about the policy. Mr Leeks states that from interviews conducted after arrival and intelligence available tothe Government, some of the Vietnamese migrants who arrived in Hong Kong were aware of the detention policy prior to leaving Vietnam.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a></u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> With the change of policy in 1982 to Vietnamese refugees, substantial amendments were made to the Immigration Ordinance (the Ordinance),<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115">Cap. 115</a>, which included the introduction of a separate Part IIIA by the Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance 1981, No.35 of 1981 thatdeals exclusively with special conditions of stay of Vietnamese refugees under s.13A, appeals against detention s.13B and the designationof refugee centres by s.13C.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It will now be convenient to deal with the scheme of Part IIIA, the subsequent amending legislation and other relevant sections ofthe Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Section 13A enabled an immigration officer to permit a former resident of Vietnam who had been examined under s.4(1)(a) which providesfor an immigration officer to determine if a person had landed unlawfully, to remain in Hong Kong as a refugee pending resettlementelsewhere. However, conditions including residence in a refugee centre could be imposed. Any contravention of stay by a refugee mightresult in the Director of Immigration (the Director) issuing a warrant under s.13A(6) authorising detention for a period not exceeding28 days. By s. 13A(7), if a warrant of detention was issued, the Director was required to serve a written notice on the refugee informinghim of the ground on which the warrant was issued and of his right of appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Section 13C provided for the Secretary for Security to designate any place as a refugee centre for the residence of Vietnamese refugeeswhile s.13C(2) gave power to the Secretary for Security to make rules providing for the treatment and control of the conduct of Vietnameserefugees in refugee centres and for the maintenance of order, discipline, cleanliness and hygiene in these centres.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Two sections that are contained in other parts of the Ordinance will also have to be considered.

In his evidence Mr Yu describes Whitehead as a very large detention centre with about25,000 detainees divided into ten sections. The applicants resided in section 6. Since Whitehead was designated as a detention centrein January 1989, there have been many disturbances and security problems including intimidation of detainees by gangs of other detainees,assaults on and robbery of staff, armed escapes and possession of weapons. In order to minimise friction and to reduce the numberof mass fights between people from different regions, the detainees are grouped together according to their area of origin in differentsections of the centre. As at the 30th April 1990, there had been 42 demonstrations which included seven incidents of mass fightingamongst detainees, and 355 reports of crime made to the police that resulted in 114 detainees being convicted of criminal offencesby the courts. 6,649 homemade weapons had also been seized. One of the worst sections which had the highest incidents of escape andother disorderly behaviour was section 6.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The situation at Whitehead became very tense in December 1989 when 51 Vietnamese boat people were repatriate mandatorily to Vietnamwhich resulted in further disturbances.

The flag had been viewed as a provocation by a certain group of detainees and as feelings were runninghigh, it was considered necessary to remove it. The staff had repeatedly approached the hut representatives requiring its removal,but they were afraid to do so because of the sentiments involved and possible repercussions. Apart from inciting other detainees,the applicants were also shouting slogans to burn the current Vietnamese flag. The flag was eventually taken down by the staff, buttwo other flags were hoisted by detainees in defiance of instructions from the staff not to do so. Mr Yu believed that Mr Tran, byvirtue of his gestures after the flag had been taken down, was acting under the instructions of a detainee named Nguyen Manh Hungwho was described as a notorious gang member. The applicants denied that Nguyen Manh Hung was a member of a gang, but was widelyknown as "Human Rights Hung"</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Mr Kwok Yuk-ho, an assistant officer of the Correctional Services Department, was responsible for the security of sections 5 and6, and his duties included gathering information on those persons who had been or were suspected of disrupting the good order andmanagement of the centre. He saw both applicants, during the incident on the 30th April 1990, close to Nguyen Manh Hung when he wasspeaking through a loudhailer to a large group of detainees. He also saw Mr Khuc speak briefly through the loudhailer. Accordingto his evidence the applicants helped to incite other detainees by waving their arms in protest and leading the shouting of slogans.He also saw detainees close to the applicants who started to burn the present Vietnamese flag.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Kwok also produced a written statement of Nguyen Xuan Thanh, a member of the peace committee made on the 17th August 1990, thatreferred to a report made to him on the 12th April 1990. Mr Nguyen states that he saw both applicants on the 12th April 1990 callingupon other boat people to prevent the staff from removing the flag. Mr Nguyen has now returned to Vietnam with the result that ithas not been possible to obtain an affidavit or affirmation from him.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> After the mass break out from Whitehead on the 29th April 1990 by 102 detainees, most of whom were armed, arrangements were madeby the authorities for a joint search operation to take place on the 4th May 1990. The purpose of the search was to look for weaponsand explosives and to apprehend and segregate individuals known to have been intimidating and bullying other detainees and instigatingdisorders within the centre.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Fong Kung-fu, a principal officer of the Correctional Services Department who was in charge of security at Whitehead DetentionCentre, upon the instructions of Mr Yu who had in turn received instructions from Mr Raymond Lai, Assistant Commissioner of the CorrectionalServices Department, compiled a list of detainees who had been causing trouble at the camp which included the names of the applicantsfollowing their involvement in the incidents that took place on the 12th and 30th April.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Evidence in the form of two anonymous letters in Vietnamese, the authenticity of which was challenged by the applicants, was producedin which it was alleged that the applicants and Nguyen Manh Hung had organised the burning of the flag on the 30th April 1990 andhad incited other boat people in the camp to cause trouble to the Government and camp management. The video tape shows the applicantstaking part in the incidents on the 12th and 30th April 1990 and during the search on the 4th May 1990.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The search on the 4th May at Whitehead was conducted by 175 members of the Correctional Services Department and 1,250 police officersusing riot control equipment. During the operation, the police met with strong and violent resistance from detainees, particularlyfrom sections 5 and 6 so that teargas had to be used. Inevitably some people were injured. 2,500 offensive weapons including sharpenedwater pipes, guard bars and homemade knives were found and removed. Mr Kwok who was present uring the search saw both applicantsshouting to other detainees through loudhailers to resist the police. Both applicants were arrested and were later transferred toStanley Prison Detention Centre for detention. Stanley Prison had been designated as a detention centre by the Secretary for Securityon the 10th January 1990.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The reasons given for transferring the applicants to Stanley Prison Detention Centre were for the purposes of restoring peace andgood order at Whitehead and for good management. It had been intended to transfer the troublemakers to Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre(Upper), but the centre was not ready as conversion work that had to be done for this purpose had not been completed. However, thework was finished soon afterwards with the result that the applicants were transferred and detained there on the 30th May 1990. Theapplicants were later transferred from Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) to Hei Ling Chau Detention Centre on the 13th July 1990where they have remained until now.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Evidence of the Applicants with regard to the incidents at Whitehead Detention Centre</u></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Tran denies that he has committed any wrongdoing during his detention in Hong Kong and emphasised that he has not been chargedwith any criminal offence or been the subject of disciplinary proceedings under the Immigration (Vietnamese Boat People) (DetentionCentres) Rules, (the Detention Centres Rules). He denies that he was a member of a gang or was a trouble maker and is not aware asto why he was singled out for what he describes as "imprisonment". He has complained about being separated from his family sincehis transfer from Whitehead and being locked up for long periods in Stanley Prison Detention Centre and Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre(Upper) when he did not have freedom of movement. He further denied allegations that had been made against him of inciting or urgingother detainees to resist the police, but that he had endeavoured to have a calming effect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> With regard to the incident on the 12th April 1990, Mr Tran denied inciting detainees in sections 5 and 6 to confront the staff whenthey were attempting to take down a South Vietnam flag or that he took instructions from Nguyen Manh Hung with regard to the removalof the flag or passed instructions to other detainees to do so.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> He referred to the incident on the 30th April 1990, the anniversary of the communist takeover in South Vietnam, as a peaceful demonstration.Anyone who wished to speak could do so and Nguyen Manh Hung and Mr Khuc had used a loudhailer for this purpose. Mr Tran says thathe spoke at the meeting about the unfairness of the screening process and that various libertarian anti-communist slogans and chantsin protest were uttered. He said that a meeting of this nature was a regular occurrence at the centre and had been allowed by theauthorities who had not prohibited peaceful protests. Mr Tran claimed that nothing was said against the camp management or staffand that he did not organise the burning of the flag. He claimed that the meeting was at all times orderly, and after it had finishedeverybody dispersed peacefully.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Khuc in his evidence generally agrees with the evidence given by Mr Tran. However, Mr Khuc also placed reliance upon his servicesas a hut representative in the centre from September 1989 to February 1990, during which time no complaints were made about his conduct.Although he agreed that he took part in the shouting, he did not organise any resistance or incite anyone to do so against the campmanagement or staff. The applicants also said that they took no part in any escape from the centre.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Detention of applicants at Stanley Prison Detention Centre</u></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Both applicants have complained that when they were taken to Stanley Prison Detention Centre, they had their clothes removed, thatthey were locked in cells for 23 hours a day and were, for the first ten days, kept in the same block as convicted and sentencedprisoners, only separated by iron grilles or gates.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Mr Cheng Chi-leung, Senior Superintendent of Stanley Prison, said the detainees shared the same prison block with prisoners duringthe first ten days of their arrival, but iron gate partitions were erected between the two parts, completely blocking one part fromthe other. The entrances to the two parts were separate and the detainees did not meet nor mix with the prisoners. As the transferof the detainees was an emergency arrangement, it was not possible to make available an independent prison block in time. However,after the first ten days, arrangements were made for the applicants and other detainees to be accommodated in a separate prison blockon their own. Although three or four of the detainees had to share a cell at night, the allegation made that they were locked intheir cells for 23 hours a day was denied. The detainees were entitled to daily outdoor exercise and enjoyed freedom of movementwithin the cell block. They were also free to use the bath and toilet facilities. The clothes worn by the applicants upon their arrivalwere taken away as they were dirty. However, the clothing supplied to them in replacement was different from that worn by prisoners.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Cheng said that the staff at Stanley have, on a number of occasions, had experience of looking after Vietnamese boat people andhave had no difficulty in applying different standards of treatment for inmates of different status under different sets of rules.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Detention of Applicants at Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper)</u></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) had been established for the purpose of separating those detainees who had been intimidatingand threatening the safety of other detainees and/or subverting the peace and good order of other detention centres where it wasnot possible to charge them with offences because of the refusal of witnesses to come forward and give evidence against them. Itwas anticipated that a stricter regime would prevail at the new centre, primarily in order to keep rival factions apart. There wasalso tighter security to make escapes more difficult. However, it was not intended that it would be used as a penal institution orthat it would be managed in any way along penal lines. It would be operated in the same way as the other existing detention centresbut with stricter supervision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Malik, Superintendent of the Correctional Services Department, who was in charge of Chi Man Wan Detention Centre (Upper), saidthat the applicants, upon admission, were kept in cellular type of accommodation. They had been told in general terms the reasonsfor their transfer as set out in guidelines and were also informed that if they wished to know the exact reasons they could see himindividually. However, neither of the applicants made such a request. Mr Malik said that although the detainees in the centre aresubject to slightly greater restrictions on their freedom of movement and to a more organised regime, they are not regarded as prisonersnor treated as such. The applicants were able to wear their private clothing, retain their own valuables and cash, and had accessto a canteen where they could purchase various items and were given a choice to work or attend educational or vocational classes.The applicants were also free to mix during recreation, education, dining and work periods with people of their own origin.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Decisions Challenged</u></p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The decisions challenged are grouped under four heads. The first is the decision of the Secretary for Security on the 10th January1990 to designate Stanley Prison as a detention centre for the detention of persons authorised to be detained under s.13D. The secondrelates to the initial decisions to detain the applicants upon their arrival at Green Island Reception Centre and their subsequenttransfers and detention at Hei Ling Chau and Whitehead, together with the transfers and temporary detention of Mr Khuc at HarbourReception I and Green Island Reception Centre, together with the decisions to detain them after the screening process pending theirremoval from Hong Kong. The third relates to the decisions to apprehend the applicants during the search at Whitehead on the 4thMay 1990 and the decisions to transfer and detain them at Stanley Prison Detention Centre, Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) andHei Ling Chau Detention Centre; the specification of Stanley Prison as a detention centre and the inclusion of the names of the applicantson the list of detainees who were to be arrested during the search. The fourth relates to the decision of the Director of Immigrationmade on the 25th May 1990 to delegate his statutory power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(1)</a>, of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> to specify the place of detention of persons under s.13D(1) to public officers in the Correctional Services Department withthe rank of Senior Superintendent and above and to the Controller of Refugees Control Centre in the Security Branch.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Grounds for Relief</u></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> The following grounds of relief have been put forward on behalf of the applicants :-</p>    <p>1.

Anderson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1942%5d%20AC%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1942] AC 206.</a> Further the protection is not limited to subjects, but extends to aliens, see <u>R. v. Home Secretary ex parte Khawaja</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 AC 74.</a> This submission is not in dispute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Miss Li attacked the initial detention of the applicants at Green Island Reception Centre on the grounds that the Director had failedto exercise his discretion under s.13D(1) which uses the word "<u>may</u>" instead of "<u>shall</u>" "be detained" so that detention on arrival should not be automatic for the detention is only required to secure the attendance ofa person for a decision to be made on refugee status. Accordingly, she argued that there should have been an investigation into theindividual circumstances of the applicants before a decision to detain was made instead of making the orders for automatic detention.She further contended that there was an alternative course available instead of detention in a detention centre by imposing a conditionof stay, pending examination under the screening process for residence at an open centre which is also a place of detention.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Miss Li went on to submit that the Director had also failed to specify the place of detention in his authorisation for the detentionof the applicants at Green Island Reception Centre upon their arrival, and that there was no power for the specification of the centreby an unidentified officer in charge.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Whilst Mr Marshall, counsel on behalf of the respondents, submitted that the English Prison Act 1952 and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234" class="autolink_findacts">Prisons Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234">Cap.234</a> are in some respects relevant to the interpretation of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a>, Miss Li argued that the powers contained therein are derived from the sentence of the court or remand in custody by the court sothat the general authority to detain is not dependent upon the construction of the Ordinance. She contended that the powers underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> must be strictly construed for the Ordinance is dealing with the administrative detention of persons who have committed no criminaloffence and who have been subject to no judicial or quasi-judicial process, authorising their detention. Accordingly the powers canonly be exercised for the purposes and objects of the Ordinance and not for any collateral purpose. By way of example, Miss Li saidthat a policy of administrative detention of Vietnamese boat people for the purposes of deterring others from coming to Hong Kongis ultra vires s.13D and therefore unlawful. Miss Li argued that on a proper construction, s.13D permits detention for the purposesof the Ordinance, but only if the discretion of whether and where to detain is properly exercised and the authority to detain isthen limited to the authority to detain in a detention centre specified by the Director.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> The powers of the Commissioner of Correctional Services to dispose of a prisoner within the prisons to which the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234" class="autolink_findacts">Prisons Ordinance</a> applies does not apply under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a>, for the place of detention must be specified if Vietnamese boat people are to be detained by the Director. Further, once Vietnameseboat people are detained in a specified detention centre, they are under the legal custody of the Superintendent of that detentioncentre and not under the control of the Commissioner of Correctional Services so that neither the Commissioner of Correctional Services,and even less his subordinates have power to transfer them to another detention centre. The authority to detain is limited to theauthority to detain in the specified place unless and until the Director exercises his discretion in accordance with law to changethe place of detention whilst each change requires a fresh authority to detain because detention and the specification of the placeof detention are inextricably linked.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Respondents' Submissions on the decision to detain and transfers up to and including Whitehead</u></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Mr Marshall submitted that the intention of the legislature under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s13d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13D</a> is to use the power to detain, at the first opportunity, and to allow Vietnamese boat people to land without any offence being committedunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38.</a> He said that it is for the police to establish the facts under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s13d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13D</a> that the person intercepted is a resident or former resident of Vietnam with no valid travel documents.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> He argued that an order by the Director for detention under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115/s13d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13D</a> was intended to justify a loss of liberty and stands in the same position as a sentence of the court under s.12(1) of the EnglishPrison Act 1952 from which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234" class="autolink_findacts">Prisons Ordinance</a> is derived. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.7(1)</a> provides :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Any prisoner sentenced to imprisonment ... may be lawfully confined in any prison ...".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He Submitted that the section provides a wide and general power of detention and justifies confinement in any prison whilst <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7(2)</a> which is derived from s.12(2) of the Prison Act 1952 reads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Prisoners shall be confined in such prisons as the Commissioner may direct and may on like direction be removed therefrom duringthe term of their imprisonment to any other prison".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He submitted that the section is directory for it enables the Commissioner to direct prisoners to prisons and for transfers betweenprisons at which stage the power is then delegated to the Superintendent of the prison.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Mr Marshall said that in 1982, s.13D was merely a new case of detention engrafted onto the existing framework of the Ordinance andthat the scheme did not provide for orders of detention specific to location. Section 35(1) empowered the administrators to detainadministrative detainees in any of the particular places generally directed by the Secretary for Security in a statutory instrument.The class of s.13D administrative detainees could be detained lawfully in any of these places by the administrators. By s.35(2),more than one place was specified for classes of detainees and members of that class could be detained in other places.  Section35(2) provides the authority for transfer between detention centres.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Conclusions on Submissions of the Applicants and Respondents with regard to the decisions to detain and transfers up to and includingWhitehead</u></p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> I am quite satisfied that the Director is not required to exercise a discretion under s.13D(1) whether or not to detain Vietnamesewho arrive in Hong Kong from Vietnam. Having regard to the policy expressed by Government, the legislature clearly intended thatall Vietnamese boat people should be detained immediately upon their arrival. From a practical point of view, the authorities wouldbe faced with an almost impossible task if they had to interview each person upon arrival as to his or her individual circumstancesbefore a decision to detain was made. For a detention order to be made, it is only necessary to establish that a person is a residentor former resident of Vietnam Without a valid travel document. It has been the practice for several years to detain all Vietnameseboat people initially at the Green Island Reception Centre or at one of the substitute reception centres for the purposes of interview,registration and port health clearance. Not only is the procedure well known to the Director and the other Government departmentsconcerned with the control of  Vietnamese boat people but they are also aware that the detention there will be temporary before eachperson is transferred to another place of detention.

The power to specify a place is, as I have said, directory whichenables the Director to specify a particular place if he wishes, but in reality, Green Island Reception Centre had already been specifiedwhen the Vietnamese first began to arrive in Hong Kong and it has continued to be so used.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The decision to detain and the subsequent transfers up to and including Whitehead cannot therefore be challenged.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Submissions in respect of the transfers and detention to Stanley Prison Detention Centre, Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) andHei Ling Chau Detention Centre</u></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Before s.13H was passed, giving power to the Secretary for Security to designate any place as a detention centre under s.13D, theonly provision available for such detention was under s.35. Miss Li submitted that by virtue of the new framework, s.35 cannot nowbe used for the detention or transfer of any person under s.13D.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> She said that if  the power to transfer under s.35(2) was available to the Secretary for Security prior to the introduction of s.13Hand the subsequent subordinate legislation, giving effect to s.13H, it cannot have survived afterwards for the clear legislativeintent was to set up a separate regime for Vietnamese boat people in separate detention centres subject to their own body of rules.In particular, Miss Li referred to s.13H(5) that enables the Secretary for Security to make rules with regard to powers of transferbetween detention centres. Miss Li also adverted to the fact that certain places of detention were deliberately removed as placeslisted in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/115B" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration (Places of Detention) Order</a> made under s.35 and were then designated under s.13H. As a result, if a person is detained under s.13D in one of the places designatedunder s.13H he could be transferred to a place listed under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/115B" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration (Places of Detention) Order</a> which was not a designated place under s.13H.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Miss Li emphasised that s.35(1) is preceded by the words "Save as otherwise provided in this Ordinance ..."and s.35(2) by the words"Subject to this Ordinance ..." which therefore precludes reliance upon this section.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> Mr Marshall agreed that s.13H impinges on the scheme, but does not replace it. The effect of s.13H is to provide a power of designationof centres specifically for s.13D detainees.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In respect of s.35(2), Mr Marshall said that the words "subject to this Ordinance" which were added in 1982 only affect the powerunder s.13A to detain in refugee centres which are provided or designated under s.13A(9). He went on to say that if their placingis the subject of a specific provision in the Ordinance, then these words have effect to exclude s.35(2) in the case of detentionwhich was intended, because a substitute provision for s.35(2) is provided in much clearer language by s.13C(4). The same words ins.35(2) do not bite "on the power of detention" enacted at the same time in s.13D because there is no provision for nominating aplace except under s.35(1). The introduction in 1989 of s.13H could have resulted in an amendment to s.13D to require detention ina detention centre, but it did not do so. There is nothing in the Ordinance to prevent s.35(2) applying to all detention centresunder s.13H and places of detention under s.35(1). Section 35(2) requires an existing lawful place where a class can be detainedand another place where they can be detained. This will then allow the Secretary for Security to direct a transfer.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> An alternative approach suggested by Mr Marshall to the interpretation of orders under s.13D is that where the Director or personsauthorised to act for him do not specify a place of detention, it is to be implied that he is to be detained in any one of thosenominated by order under s.35(1). Accordingly, after the 1989 amendment that introduced s.13H the implication would be any placeunder those nominated by order under s.13H or those nominated under s.35(1).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Conclusions on transfers and detention at Stanley Prison Detention Centre, Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) and Hei Ling Chau DetentionCentre</u></p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> In considering the submissions, it is clear that the legislature intended in 1982 to provide for the indefinite detention of formerresidents of Vietnam pending resettlement under s.13A or removal under s.13D and s.13E. When s.13D was introduced in 1982, only s.35could be used for nominating a place of detention. Section 13D enabled the Director to select one of the places nominated by theSecretary for Security under s.35(1). The words "otherwise provided" would have applied for the exclusion of s.35(1) when s.13A wasamended in 1982 to provide for the detention of Vietnamese refugees in a refugee centre. In 1988, the policy changed so that non-refugeeswould not be given status under s.13A but would be detained under s.13D, and if not found to be refugees, detained under the sectionpending removal under s.13E. Further the Ordinance added s.13H which provided for the designation of detention centres for personsdetained under s.13D, and administration by one of the three services, the Commissioner of Correctional Services, the Commissionerof Police or the Chief Staff Officer of the Civil Aid Services. However, there is no express power of transfer for detention centresakin to s.13C(4) for closed centres. In effect s.13H provides power for Vietnamese boat people to be placed in special centres which,however, need not be exclusively used as a detention centre although in practice it will be so used under s.13D.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The nub of the submission for the applicants is that the combined effect of s.13D and s.13H is that persons detained under s.13Dmay only be detained in a detention centre designated under s.13H and places listed in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/115B" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration (Places of Detention) Order</a> from that time on were not available as places where s.13D detainees could be detained. It was submitted that s.13H(5) has a two-foldeffect in that it empowered the Secretary for Security to make rules for the matters provided for and also required him to do so,if he wished to provide for those matters. After the introduction of s.13H, it was submitted that the legislature intended that theSecretary for Security would deal with such matters as transfers between detention centres for reasons of management, security andthe other purposes referred in s.13H(5) by way of making rules, and therefore it was no longer open to him to use s.35(2) for thetransfer of s.13D detainees.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> However, the Ordinance does not provide for the exclusion of s.35 to cases under s.13D for the Ordinance does not provide that aparticular class of detainee must be detained in a centre designated under s.13H. The construction placed by Miss Li upon the savingprovisions in s.35 only relate to the changes made to s.13A in 1982 with regard to the power to detain in a refugee centre designatedunder s.13A(9).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> While s.13H gives power for the Secretary for Security to designate any place as a detention centre for s.13D detainees, no amendmenthas been made to s.13D to require such detention in a detention centre. Section 35(2) will therefore apply to all detention centresunder s.13H and the place of detention used under s.35(1). A transfer can then be ordered by the Secretary for Security under s.35(2).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> As a result, I accept the submissions made on behalf of the respondents that the transfers to and detentions at Stanley Prison DetentionCentre, Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper) and Hei Ling Chau Detention Centre were validly made under s.35 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Designation of Stanley Prison as a Detention Centre</u></p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Stanley Prison was designated by the Secretary for Security on the 10th January 1990 as a detention centre for the detention of personsauthorised to be detained under s.13D by virtue of s.13H(1) of the ordinance. In the earlier oral decisions that were made to apprehendthe applicants and thereafter to transfer them from Whitehead Detention Centre to Stanley Prison Detention Centre, a written authorisationfor their detention at Stanley Prison was made by Mr W.Y. Chan, Acting Assistant Director of Immigration on the 25th May 1990. Thewritten authorisation was given in order to avoid any doubt that may have arisen with regard to the earlier oral authorisation forthe detention made on the 3rd May 1990. A written authorisation was produced at a hearing before Deputy Judge Gall on the 25th May1990 when the applicants sought leave for the grant of a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the specification of Stanley Prison asdetention centre and for their detention in that institution. However, the application for the writ was refused.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> On behalf of the applicants, it has been submitted that there was no power for the Secretary for Security to designate Stanley Prisonas a detention centre and that it was therefore ultra vires and further, it was inconsistent with the scheme of the ordinance. Itis also alleged that the Secretary for Security failed to take into account the matters set out in the schedule to the re-amendednotice of application for leave to apply for judicial review to which I have already referred in the Grounds for Relief.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> It was contended that by virtue of those matters, Stanley Prison was an inappropriate place of detention for persons detained generallyunder s.13D(1).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Miss Li adverted to the combined effect of subsections (5), (6) and (7) of s.13H whereby if the Secretary for Security wishes toprovide for the matters set out in subsection (6), he must do so by way of rules, in particular the imposition of punishment andseparate confinement, whether by way of punishment, transfer by management and control or otherwise. She submitted that subsection(7) contemplates that if there is a breach of the rules, and it is to be made an offence and a term of imprisonment is to be a penaltyor punishment, it must be provided by the rules. The Secretary for Security cannot, therefore, by pass the scheme by designatingStanley Prison as a detention centre so as to enable the Director to specify it as a place of detention for Vietnamese boat peopleunder s.13D. The Director has no role in the treatment and the control of conduct of persons detained under s.13D and the management,security, maintenance of order or discipline in the detention centres or the punishment of offenders. Further, it is inconsistentwith <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/234" class="autolink_findacts">Prisons Ordinance</a> which deals with the setting apart of places as prisons for Stanley has been specifically set aside for the purposes of a prison.It was submitted that Stanley cannot cease to be a place set apart as a prison unless and until the Secretary for Security has, byan order published in the Gazette, ordered the discontinuance of the use of Stanley as a prison which had not been done. Miss Lialso emphasised that the Detention Centres Rules are a different set of rules to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/234A" class="autolink_findacts">Prison Rules</a> so a question arose as to which rules should be applied to the applicants when they were detained in Stanley. This argument equallyapplies to the detention at Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre (Upper).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> Mr Marshall in reply submitted that the decision to designate Stanley Prison as a detention centre was a correct administrative decision,particularly having regard to the background that in December 1989, there was a mandatory repatriation to Vietnam. Whitehead DetentionCentre was the biggest centre with between 22,000 to 25,000 inmates and it was becoming increasingly ungovernable with resistancebeing experienced from detainees. Accordingly, for management reasons, there was a need to remove trouble makers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> Whether or not Stanley is a prison is immaterial to the decision for the place can be specified for various purposes as for exampleMa Tau Wei Girls' Home which is also used for a place of detention under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/226" class="autolink_findacts">Juvenile Offenders Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/225">Cap. 225</a>; a place for refuge under the Protection of Women and Juveniles Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/213">Cap. 213</a>; and as a place of detention underthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a>. He argued that multiple designation is the rule rather than the exception and that if different rules apply, the detainees are keptphysically apart as they were in this case. The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/234A" class="autolink_findacts">Prison Rules</a> would apply to prisoners in the prison and the Detention Centres Rules to the Vietnamese refugees.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> In my judgment, the Secretary for Security had power under s.13D to designate any place as a detention centre irrespective of thefact that the place was also used for another purpose such as a prison. Stanley Prison was both designated as a prison and as a detentioncentre and it was a matter for the authorities to determine which part should be used as a prison and which part as a detention centre.It was not necessary to publish in the Gazette the discontinuance of a particular part of the prison which was to be used as detentioncentre. The only requirement of the authorities was to ensure that arrangements were made, as they were in this case, to keep theVietnamese boat people physically separate from the prisoners and to apply to them the Detention Centres Rules which would provideno difficulty for the Correctional Services Department.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> I accept Mr Marshall's further submission that the applicants have no locus standi to challenge the decision of the Secretary forSecurity, for although they will be affected by the decision, they have no sufficient interest to challenge what is an administrativedecision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Delegation by the Director of Immigration under s.13D to Specify Places of Detention to Persons Outside the Immigration Service</u></p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> The delegation by the Director on the 25th May 1990 of his statutory duty to specify the place of detention for persons under s.13D(1)to public officers in the Correctional Services Department of the rank of senior superintendent and above and to the Controller ofthe Refugees Control Centre in the Security Branch was made under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> which provides :-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"43.

Only atthat moment when the place is specified do the Vietnamese boat people fall within the custody of the Superintendent of the detentioncentre to whom they have been committed. The role of the Commissioner of Correctional Services and the Superintendent is confinedto the management and control of individual detention centres and no where in the ordinance does the Commissioner of CorrectionalServices have the right or power to specify, but where it has been necessary for the Commissioner of Correctional Services to havethe power to transfer refugees from one centre to another, it has been expressly provided for by the legislature under s.13C(4).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Miss Li submitted that the Director should not have delegated his power to a public officer in another department. However, no authoritywas cited that precludes such a delegation being made whilst it is highly desirable where several departments are involved and workingclosely together that the delegation in question should have been made. I do not therefore accept this argument.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> Mr Marshall relied on the Carltona principle that was enunciated by Lord Greene M.R. in <u>Carltona Limited v. Commissioners of Works and Others</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%202%20All%20ER%20560" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] 2 All ER 560</a> where he said at 563 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"         In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properlygiven to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personallyattend to them. To take the example of the present case no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individualministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that, in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind tothe matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of theministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally,the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answerbefore Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an officialof such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for thatin Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsibleto Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the placewhere complaint must be made against them."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> However, those principles which were explained in <u>R. v.

The Carltona principle is not therefore applicable to this case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Although an express power is provided under s.2 of the Ordinance for Director to include Deputy Director and any assistant directorof immigration, I am quite satisfied that it is not meant to exclude the use of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> for the purposes of delegating those powers in the usual way.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> I also agree that the decision to delegate was plainly a management decision based upon practical necessity. It was carried out withinthe framework of the statutory regime so that it is not amenable to judicial review. The applicants may have been affected by thedecision, but they do not have a sufficient interest to justify any challenge to the decision. Accordingly I hold that they do nothave any locus standi.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>If there is a power to transfer, is there a power to transfer for management purposes</u></p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> Miss Li submitted that without express legislative sanction by way of provision in the Detention Centres Rules, the Secretary forSecurity could not create a detention centre with a regime such as Chi Ma Wan (Upper) nor designate any prison as a detention centreunder s.13H. With this submission, for reasons that I have already given, I do not agree. Further, the Secretary for Secretary couldnot use any power under s.35(2) in relation to s.13D detainees to effect a transfer for reasons for which the legislature had intendedhim to provide by way of rules under s.13H(5).  Miss Li went on to say that there was no evidence that the Secretary for Securityhad exercised any power under s.35(2) to direct and specify a place of alternative detention in respect of any of the transfers ofthe applicants to the different detention centres where they were detained.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> Mr Marshall responded by saying that management purposes means the maintenance of good order. If the Secretary for Security undersection 35(2) can direct transfers, a proper purpose must be for maintaining good order. He argued that a governing principle oflegal policy underlying the interpretation of the extent and use of this power must be the maintenance of law and order and internalsecurity. The detention of persons, particularly in large numbers, poses internal security risks to the inmates and those chargedwith detaining them and particularly to the local population if a breakout is threatened. A detention centre out of control threatensthe Queen's peace. My attention was drawn to <u>R. v. Dep Gov of Parkhurst ex p.

In the course of hisjudgment Tudor-Evans J. found that the decision to transfer the plaintiff to the control unit was an administrative and non-punitivedecision taken to relieve the prison system.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> It was therefore submitted by Mr Marshall that the decision to move the applicants to Stanley and then Chi Ma Wan (Upper) was alsoan administrative and non-punitive one taken to relieve the detention centre system. On being detained, the only entitlement of theapplicants was to be detained according to the rules applicable to each detention centre in which they were detained. The DetentionCentres Rules were applied both in Stanley and Chi Ma Wan (Upper).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> I have no hesitation in accepting the submission made by Mr Marshall that the transfers were not punitive, but purely as I have saidpreviously for good order and management.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>The Right to be Heard and Right to Notice and Reasons</u></p>    <p><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> Miss Li contended that the applicants had a right to be heard in respect of the transfers to and the detention in Stanley and ChiMa Wan (Upper) because of the penal effect on them of the transfers, and that they had received no warning that further participationin any form of political protest would lead to a transfer to a harsher regime in these institutions with a separation from theirfamilies. The argument advanced that the applicants had a legitimate expectation that they could engage in peaceful protests andcould expect to remain with their families and to have free  association was however wholly misconceived. The maintenance of peaceand good order clearly takes priority over any right remain with the family or to have freedom of association whilst there was nolegal basis for the contention that the applicants could indulge in peaceful protests in the absence of any express permission forthem to do so.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> In the circumstances of this case, when a dire emergency had arisen it would have been impracticable to give the applicants a rightto be heard, and as the detention was not penal in nature, but purely for management purposes to ensure good order, I am quite satisfiedthat the applicants were not entitled to be heard nor were they entitled to any notice or reasons. However, reasons were subsequentlygiven to the applicants by Mr Malik.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>False Imprisonment</u></p>    <p><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> It was submitted by Miss Li that if the detentions under s.13D are held to be bad, the applicants are entitled to claim damages forfalse imprisonment. She argued that the rights of the applicants as s.13D detainees are the same as all persons in Hong Kong exceptso far as they are expressly or by necessary implication removed by the Ordinance and the Detention Centres Rules. The impairmentof residual liberty by further imprisonment in the wrong place or otherwise in breach of the Detention Centres Rules amounts to atrespass to the person, see <u>Cobbett v.

He thereforecontended that an order for detention under s.13D operates as a defence to an action for false imprisonment brought by the applicants.It affords a defence to the respondents whether the action is brought against the Secretary for Security and the Commissioner ofCorrectional Services in respect of confinement in a detention centre or in respect of a vicarious liability for the acts or defaultsof particular officers. The detention of a prisoner under section 12(1) of the Prison Act 1952 is not rendered unlawful by any variationin the regime or in the conditions of his confinement. Indeed, what happens to the prisoner whilst he is in prison is regulated bythe prison rules. Parliament by main and subordinate legislation has created an internal statutory regime for the treatment of prisoners.Breach of the prison rules does not and cannot give rise to an action of or claim in private law for false imprisonment. To concludeotherwise would be contrary to well established authority to the effect  that no private law cause of action lies in respect of abreach of the prison rules, see <u>Becker v. Home Office</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20QB%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 QB 407.</a> Mr Marshall contended that the position is the same under the present statutory framework for the detention of Vietnamese refugees.If it is accepted that a prisoner or detainee enjoys a residual liberty within the prison or detention centre or that such a rightarises from any other legal source, Mr Marshall submitted that such a conception can have no wider reach or meaning than the prisoner'sor detainee's legal rights as described and the suggestion begs the question whether the rules can give rise to a cause of actionat law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> Mr Marshall submitted that it is wholly consistent with the applicants' case that the statutory and administrative regime should,as it does, recognise and give effect to the interest of the detainees. Their rights are subject to the internal law of the detentioncentre consituted by the Ordinance and rules and the right to petition the Governor.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> If an applicant complains of an assault or battery, he may sue in respect of those matters, or if there has been an interferencewith residual liberty without justification, the prisoner may have a claim for damages in the tort of misfeasance. There are, therefore,ample safeguards under the common law and under statute to protect the detainee in respect of any unjustifiable interference withhis residual liberty.

Mr Kat, junior counsel for the applicants, went even further when he submittedthat they were lawfully in Hong Kong, having been given permission to remain in detention. In another submission, it was contendedthat the applicants had not consented to the present regime of screening as set out in the notice, ex.CL-3, for the notice that wasread to the applicants or was in force at the time of their arrival, ex.CL-2, misrepresented the true position in law and fact sothat they did not have a genuine option when they arrived in Hong Kong apart from sailing on. It was submitted that the applicantsby reason of the policy of first asylum had a legitimate expectation of a right to enter Hong Kong for that purpose, and in the caseof Mr Khuc, taking into account the policy in force at the time of his arrival before the screening policy was introduced, that hehad a legitimate right to be admitted as refugee. To say the least, these were startling propositions and remarkable for their audacity.However, s.38(2) merely renders inoperative the power to prosecute for an offence under s.38(1) for landing in Hong Kong unlawfully.It does not give any legitimacy to the presence of the applicants who have no lawful right to land unless and until permission hasbeen granted for this purpose. Consequently, their presence here is unlawful.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> Although Miss Li disagreed with the analogy drawn by Mr Marshall with the prisons legislation and the authorities cited with regardto prisoners, I consider that such an analogy is wholly appropriate. The applicants,  as I have said, are present in Hong Kong unlawfullyand if it had not been for the deeming provision in s.38(2), could have been prosecuted for landing unlawfully in Hong Kong unders.38(1) which carries a maximum penalty on conviction of a fine of $10,000 and three years imprisonment. Accordingly, in my judgment,the rights of the applicants fall to be considered in the same way as that of a prisoner subject to the rights conferred under the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> and the rules applicable to detention centres. The decision in <u>Hague</u> to which I have referred, is therefore particularly relevant to this case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> Apart from the highly technical arguments that were directed to the validity of the powers exercised under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/115" class="autolink_findacts">Immigration Ordinance</a> which I have held were unfounded, the main thrust of the applicants' case has been about the unfair conduct of the authorities inselecting them for apprehension and their subsequent transfers and detention in Stanley Prison Detention Centre, Chi Ma Wan DetentionCentre (Upper) and Hei Ling Chau Detention Centre.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> The facts reveal that Whitehead Detention Centre had almost been reduced to a state of anarchy with the result that the authoritieshad to take stern measures in order to restore peace and good order. One of the steps to be taken was to remove the disruptive andintimidatory influence of the detainees, including the applicants who were known to be troublemakers. The applicants contend thatthey are innocent and have been singled out unfairly. However, the authorities, quite naturally, are not required to establish theallegations against the applicants to the degree of proof required in a criminal trial, but are entitled to act upon evidence thatgives rise to a reasonable suspicion that they were involved in the disturbances. Both Mr Yu and Mr Kwok were eye witnesses to someof the applicants' conduct whilst there were the complaints made in the two anonymous letters, the statement of Nguyen Xuan Thanhand the video tape. There was indeed abundant evidence in the hands of the authorities that justified the inclusion of the namesof the applicants on the list of those persons who were to be arrested. The decisions to remove the applicants and for their detentionat the other detention centres were neither unreasonable nor unlawful. The decisions were not intended to be punitive although theresult can be regarded as such having regard to the stricter regime that prevailed. However, that was an inevitable consequence attributableto the conduct of the applicants. It was necessary for good order and management to remove the unruly elements to restore peace tothe camp. When they were removed, the applicants were not mixed with the ordinary Prison population at Stanley, but were subjectto their own discipline under the Detention Centres Rules.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> The argument put forward that the authorities should have either charged the applicants with a criminal offence or proceeded to usethe Detention Centres Rules for disciplinary proceedings was unrealistic for in the circumstances of this case, they were re requiredto act quickly in an emergency. Further, the authorities were in any event not obliged to adopt either of these courses for theirdiscretion cannot be fettered in such a situation. The alternatives were in fact considered, but the difficulties likely to be encounteredin finding witnesses and the fear of retaliation from the persons charged in respect of anonymous complaints were matters to be takeninto account in not adopting an alternative course.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> However, even if the applicants were innocent of the complaints alleged and a mistake had been made in singling them out, it wouldnot have justified a challenge to the decisions by way of judicial review unless the authorities had acted unfairly and in breachof the rules of natural justice. Upon the facts of this case, the authorities have not been shown to have acted other than in goodfaith upon evidence that raised a strong suspicion that the applicants were trouble makers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a> At its highest, all that this case has been about was the detention of the applicants at Stanley Prison Detention Centre for a periodof just under four weeks and at Chi Man Wan Detention Centre (Upper) for a period of six weeks. No complaint has been made that theapplicants were subjected to intolerable living conditions or suffered any maltreatment. The applicants are now living on their ownat Hei Ling Chau Detention Centre without their families which is entirely their own fault as it was believed that the detentionthere was unlawful. As I have said there was no Justification for this view.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p121" class="pseudopara" id="p121">121.</a> If I had held that there had been a breach of the procedures or a breach of the rules of natural justice where applicable, I am quitesatisfied that no injustice has been suffered by either of the applicants. Accordingly, in the exercise of my discretion, I wouldin any event have refused to grant any of the relief that has been claimed, see <u>R. v. Monopolies and Mergers Commission ex parte Argyll Group Plc.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 763</a>, <u>R. v.

Not only did they challenge the legality of theirdetention, as I have said, on highly technical and specious grounds, but they have also claimed, without any justification, damagesand exemplary damages for assault and false imprisonment.
