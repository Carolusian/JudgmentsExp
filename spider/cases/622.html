He travelled in the first carriage of thetrain heading for LoWu and when the train arrived at LoWu, huge crowd of people rushed their way to the exit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> There were two vertical metal I-beams erected on this platform in the vicinity near the front carriage of the train.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff says after he alighted from the train and stepped onto the platform, he went towards the exit, following the flow ofthe crowd. He was pushed from behind and accidentally trapped his right forearm into the narrow gap inside the I-beam and sufferedinjuries. He therefore brings this action for damages for personal injuries and other consequential losses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Defendant, are sued as the occupier of the LoWu Station including the area where the I-beam situate, for breach of the commonduty of care cast upon them by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>) and also for negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The injuries sustained by the Plaintiff is not in dispute but its continued effect on the Plaintiff and therefore the quantificationof his loss are not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Defendant also denies liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Defendant admits that it was the occupier of the platform at the material time and that it owed the Defendant the common dutyof care set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.3(2)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>. The Defendant denies that platform 3 (including the I-beams) was defective or dangerous and that it was in breach ofa duty of care or its common duty of care. Contributory negligence is also alleged and at issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Defendant accepts that if the Plaintiff can prove a breach of the occupiersâ common duty of care, he will also succeed in negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Liability</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> According to the Plaintiff, the I-beam in question was further to the back, closer to the wall and had a metal pipe set in the middle.There was no warning sign alerting or warning passengers of the presence the I-beams and to avoid them nor was the I-beam area cordonedoff or so arranged as to prevent the passengers from approaching any of the I-beams or getting into contact with them. There wasno broadcast on the platform to alert passengers of the dangers exposed to passengers by the I-beams.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> According to the Defendantâs witness Fung, there has been no risk assessment of the I-beam and therefore there was no safety measurefor the I-beam.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Defendant says according to Defendantâs 2<sup>nd</sup> witness Chan, passengers to LoWu Station travelling at peak hours on busy days would:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) board the first four carriages</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) many of them would carry luggage</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) rush to the exit in a hurried manner.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">It is therefore self-evident that there would be a lot of pushings amongst the passengers and there would be a bottle-neck congestionat the platform area of the front carriages before passengers reach the exit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Defendant says that itâs self-evident that passengers when leaving the front carriages to LoWu Station platform 3 during peakhours are likely to get into contact with the I-beam because of congestion and pushing and thus would likely be injured in similarmanner which the Plaintiff met his accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Plaintiff says that it was clearly foreseeable by the Defendant with the vast number of passengers using the platform and manyof them having luggage with them and walking quickly or rushing to cross the border ahead of others, that very likely the existenceof the I-beam with the small gaps inside it would likely cause injuries to the passengers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The Plaintiff says the Defendant should foresee such a situation arising from the congested platform and yet it simply did nothingor did not take any or any reasonable steps to prevent such occurrence. In short the Plaintiff was placed in such predicament bythe Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Plaintiff points out that the question in the present case is what was reasonable to expect the Defendant in the particular circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The Plaintiff says to leave the I-beam wholly unguarded or without claddings and to allow it to be there in the main thoroughfareposed real risks of injury to the vast number of passengers using this part of the platform.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Plaintiff further says that no reported similar accident in the past does not mean the Defendant should not take note of thereal and potential risks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Plaintiff commented that although the Defendant claims that there are similar I-beams (some of them also have a pipe in betweenthe empty space of the I-beam) in many overseas countries, the Defendant did not adduce any evidence in respect of any presence orabsence of measures taken to ensure no contact of those I-beams by passengers at the overseas railway stations, size and measurementsof the gap in these âIâ-beams, the Plaintiff says further that the Defendant cannot categorically say that no accident of similarkind have not happened at the overseas stations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The Plaintiff submitted that as the Defendantâs 2<sup>nd</sup> witness told the court that no risk assessment of the I-beam have been made by the Defendant, it therefore clearly shows that theDefendant did not address its mind to the risk caused by the I-beam and that no preventive/ protective steps had been taken.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The Plaintiff says it is obvious that the Defendant has failed to apply its mind to the real and potential risks to the passengerscaused by the I-beam. He says the fact that there was no report of previous prior similar accidents cannot be used as an excuse giventhe fact that LoWu Station is the busiest cross border station.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Although the Plaintiff admitted that he had travelled in the front carriage on many occasions prior to the accident, he says thathis attention had not in the past been drawn to the potential risks created by the I-beam. He says the occurrence of the accidentwas no fault of his own. Thus he says he should not be held responsible for the accident at all and there is no contributory negligenceon his part.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The Defendantâs 1<sup>st</sup> witness Fung says that the âIâ-beam in question was actually constructed by the Government in 1986 to support canopy roof overplatform and was in compliance with the Building Regulations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> He further says that this type of âIâ-beam is used substantially on East Rail and, including with inset drain pipes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> According to the Defendantâs 2<sup>nd</sup> witness Chan, from 1994, there have been over 1 million passengers using platform 3 (or platform 2). By 2002, the average numberof passenger using platform 3 was roughly 2 million per month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> He further alleged that there had not been one recorded personal injury to a passenger using platform 3 involving I-beam of thiskind, at least 5 years prior to 13<sup>th</sup> April 2002, i.e., date of accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> He says for platform 2, where similar number of passengers used, in the 5 years between 1997 to 2001, prior to the time of the accident, over 182 million passengers had used this platform 2, there were 3 recorded incidents involving I-beam pillars have of the injuriessuffered was similar to that of the Plaintiff. There were all injuries to the forehead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The Defendantâs witness Chan and Lee gave evidence and said steps had been taken by the Defendant at the material times to ensurepassengersâ safety on the platform. They said there were different broadcastings by the Defendant and by the police on duty towarn passengers on the platform not to push and to remain orderly and that 7 trained staffs and duty manager were on duty to controlthe crowd. The Defendant had also arranged 3 police officers and other staff of the Defendant stationed on platform 3 to assist inthe crowd control.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Defendant says that there is no evidence before this Court to establish as a fact that platform 3 was not reasonably safe byreason of the presence of the I-beam pillars and/ or with inset of pipes. The Defendant further suggests that the Defendant couldnot have reasonably foreseen injury of the hand suffered by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The Defendant says the platform with the I-beams as they were at the time of accident was reasonably safe in all the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The Defendant further submitted that none of the platform was dangerous or posed a risk to passenger and that the same was reasonablyforeseeable by the Defendant. The Defendant says that the risk was âusual and entirely normal riskâ. The Defendant says thereis in law no duty to guard or warn of such risks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Further the Defendant says that even if this Court finds that there was such a risk or danger which was foreseeable by the Defendant,the Plaintiff cannot establish that the Defendant had failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure the I-beams were reasonably safe.The Defendants says that they had taken all reasonably steps to ensure safety of the passengers and that the Plaintiff was reasonablysafe when he used platform 3.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The Defendant threw doubt on the Plaintiffâs version as to how the accident occurred. The Defendant says the accident could haveoccurred without the breach of duty of care by the Defendant. He commented the Plaintiff for having no witness as to how the accidentoccurred. Of course, on this point, the Plaintiff says they did ask and was refused CCTV tape covering the accident site at the materialtime and was told that of the Defendant did not catch how the accident occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The Defendant says the Plaintiff has previously told the Defendantâs witness Lee, the staff at the platform at the time that hewas pushed by a boarding passenger whereas later he gave instructions to his counsel that he was pushed by departing passenger.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The Defendant also queried the Plaintiff for not demonstrating in Court as to how the accident caused the claimed injuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The Defendant advanced that as the Plaintiff was very experienced in using the front compartment of the train to the LoWu station(as per his evidence) during busy hours like Saturday evenings over the previous 2 to 3 years prior to the accident, he must haveseen the pillars and should know to avoid them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The Defendant says the evidence of the Plaintiff show that the Plaintiff did use platform 3 for about 180 to 238 times before theaccident, that he agreed that crowd pushing on the train and the platform was common. It was said the Plaintiff must be taken toguard against such âperfectly normalâ and obvious risks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The Defendant says that great care had already been taken to cater for crowd safety on platform but he admitted that it is impossibleto stop crowd pushing and rushing, especially given the need to keep a substantial flow of passengers moving. The Defendant saysthis was perhaps the <i>cause</i> <i>sine qua non</i> of the Plaintiffâs injury rather than the presence of I-beam pillar.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The Defendant referred to the case of <u>Kam Wai Ming</u> v. <u>MTR Corporation and others</u>, DCPI 1408 of 2002 where HH Judge Carlson says the proximate cause for the injury to the passenger on the escalator was because thePlaintiff did not hold the handrail and the unexpected stop of the escalator which provided the setting against which the accidentoccurred but that has not been shown to be result of any negligence or breach of duty of on the part of the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The issue here was whether the Defendant was in breach of the common duty of care. The burden of proof lies on the Plaintiff to establishthat the Defendant failed to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case as is unreasonable to see that Plaintiff thevisitor is reasonably safe in using the platform as a passenger.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> defined the âcommon duty of careâ as âa duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to seethat the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupierto be thereâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> provides: âIn determining whether the occupier of premises has discharged the common duty of care to a visitor, regard is to behad to all the circumstances, so that (for example) - where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger of which he had been warnedby the occupier, the warning is not to be treated without more as absolving the occupier from liability, unless in all the circumstancesit was enough to enable the visitor to be reasonably safe.â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The Plaintiff invited the Court to consider the case of <u>Blackett</u> v. <u>British Railways Board</u>, the Times, 19<sup>th</sup> December 1967, unreported, where the Plaintiff passenger walked on the train platform in order to make his way. The accident occurredwhen he caught his foot and fell when trying to step over a mail-bag in order to get away from two converging luggage trolleys. PhillimoreJ observed that the Defendant company had chosen to run two sets of goods trolleys in opposite directions along a platform crowdedwith passengers preparing for departure and with load on one of them badly secured that a mail bag fell off. It was held that theDefendant was negligent in placing the Plaintiff in that predicament and was in breach of the duty under the Occupiersâ LiabilityAct 1957.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff says similarly that the presence of the uncladded I-beam pillars on platform 3 placed the Plaintiff in that predicamentand the Defendant was in breach of the duty under the Occupierâs Liability Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The Plaintiff also referred this Court to Lord Goddard CJ in <u>Tuner</u> v. <u>Arding &amp; Hobbs Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20ALL%20ER%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 ALL ER 911</a> where at 912 he said: âThe duty of a shopkeeper in this class of case is well-established. It may be said to be a duty to use reasonablecare to see that the shop floor, on which people are invited, is kept reasonably safe, and if an unusual danger is present of whichthe injured person is unaware, and the danger is one which would not be expected and ought not to be present, the onus of proof inon the Defendants to explain how it was that the accident happened.â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The Plaintiff cited The <b><i>Law of Tort in Hong Kong</i></b> by Srivastava &amp; Tennekone, at page 313 under the heading âGeneral Principleâ which states âWhether or not the occupierhas breached his common duty of care is a question of fact. It is determined by applying the same tests as may be applied in thecase of a breach of general duty of care. For example, the courts will inquire into such matters as foreseeability of the occurrenceof the injury, (see <u>Chordas</u> v. <u>Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2091%20ALR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 91 ALR 149)</a>, the risk of greater injury if caused, the costs of avoiding such injury, the utility of the defendantâs act, and the frequencyof accidents causing such injury â¦ By the same token, the occupier is not required to guard against improbable risks.â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> In <b><i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i></b> 18<sup>th</sup> Edition, referred by the Plaintiff, para 10 â 28, it is said: âIn determining whether what was done or not done by the occupierwas in fact reasonable, and whether in the particular circumstances of the case the visitor was reasonably safe, the court is freeto consider all the circumstances, such as how obvious the danger is, warnings, lighting, fencing, the age of the visitor, the purposeof his visit, the conduct to be expected of him, and the estate of knowledge of the occupier. The difficulty and expense of removingthe danger is a relevant factor.â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The Defendant says the duty is take reasonable care to ensure reasonable safety in all the circumstances and not to ensure no accidentor perfection. He referred to the cases of <u>Beaton</u> v. <u>Devon CC</u>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1675.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] EWCA Civ 1675</a>, <u>Stojan Petrovic</u> v. <u>Chedone â McMaster Hospitals</u> [1988] 10 ACWS (3d) 97, Ontario High Court, <u>Siu Shi Cheung</u> v. <u>Sincere Time</u> (unrep.) HCPI 606 of 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> He says the Courts have recognized that they must look to âall the circumstancesâ before deciding that a place or fixture isnot reasonably safe. There are 2 critical factors (a) how common the feature is in use and (b) whether there has been any significanthistory to show that it is not reasonably safe. E.g.: <u>Word</u> v. <u>Hertfordshine</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20WLR%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 WLR 357</a> and <u>Staples</u> v. <u>West Porset DC</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%2091%20Qd%20R%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 91 QR 439.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The Defendant says therefore that if the I-beam pillars are common installation and that there is no significant history of dangeror injury, the Court should not find the premises to be defective or dangerous.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> It is further submitted that if the risk is usual and entirely normal and which the visitor can see, the Defendant does not havethe duty to guard against the same, <u>Simonds</u> v. <u>Isle of Wight Council</u>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2003/2303.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] EWHC 2303 (QB).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The Defendant says that if the risk is obvious, there is no duty to warn, <u>Staples</u> v. <u>West Dorest District Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20PIQR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] PIQR 439.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Decision on liability</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> This Court has carefully considered all the medical evidence and had the benefit of observing and hearing the witnesses in Court.This Court finds on a balance of probability that the Plaintiff was injured as a result of being pushed by others against the I-beampillar in question on platform 3 of LoWu Station at the material times. This Court does not find the discrepancy in the departingpassenger and the boarding passenger as being very material. There is no point for the Plaintiff to lie about being pushed by a âboardingâor a âdepartingâ passenger so long as he said he was pushed by this person. He could be pushed from his front or back or hisside.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Medical evidence from the medical experts of the parties did not say the injury of the Plaintiff was inconsistent with the way thePlaintiff sad he was injured.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> It was accepted that the Plaintiff did ask the Defendant for CCTV tape concerning the area of the I-beam in question at the materialtimes but was told the same was unavailable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> It was undisputed that during the few years prior to the accident, several millions of passenger used both platform 2 and platform3, where I-beam pillars situate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> This Court also accepted the Defendantâs submission that the Plaintiff was familiar with platform 3 and had been a frequent userof the same during busy hours alighting from the first compartment of the train.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> It is not disputed further that only 3 passengers were injured, all with forehead injuries involving contact with the I-beam pillaron platform 2 and that there was no record of anyone getting injured after they got in contact with I-beam pillars on platform 3.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The Defendantâs witness gave evidence and said these I-beam pillars were constructed by the government in the past and that theycomply with the Building Regulations, that they are also frequently found in platforms in East Rail and overseas.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> It is worth noting however that LoWu is one of the busiest railway stations in the world and that on Defendantâs admission, whatevermeasures the Defendant took, they could not really avoid the crowd pushing on the platform.  It strikes to this Court that shouldthat be the case, then it is reasonably foreseeable that passengers on the platform might get in contact with these I-beam even ifthey should have already tried to avoid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> On the Defendantâs admission, there was no broadcasting that people should avoiding contacting these uncladded I-beams nor werethese I-beams cladded. The I-beam pillar with inset of pipes pillars uncladded pose reasonable foreseeable risks to the passengersnearby.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> The Defendantâs witness admitted that the Defendant did not have risk assessment on the I-beam pillars despite the 3 reported accidentsinvolving them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> There are also, as admitted, nothing that condoned the said I-beam pillars from these rushing passengers during busy hours.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> This Court did also consider the fact that by cladding the I-beams, some space on the platform would be taken away and that the costsfor such cladding was not something exorbitant or unaffordable by the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> It is also reasonable to say that if one should avoid the crowd on the platform during busy hours, one really could not really proceedat reasonable speed because then, the trains schedule is very frequent and the platforms are always crowded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> I agree with the Defendant that though the I-beam pillars are common features in MTR or railway stations elsewhere, there is no evidencewhether there are accidents in these places and there was no evidence of the dimensions of these I-beams or the size of the gap betweenthe pipes inset in these I-beam pillar.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> This Court is aware of the relatively low incidence of accidents involving these I-beams.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> This Court rules that in all the circumstances of the case, the Defendant had breached the duty under Occupierâs Liability Ordinanceand common duty of care and was negligent in not ensuring reasonable safety in all the circumstance of the case for its passengerson the platform although injuries to passenger resulting from contact with uncladded I-beam pillars was reasonably foreseeable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> I also do not find any evidence to support the contributory negligence on the part of the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Injuries and medical condition</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The Plaintiff was born on 14<sup>th</sup> April 1964. He was 38 years old at time of accident and was 41 years old at time of trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> According to the Plaintiff, after the accident, he was immediately admitted to the Emergency Unit of North District Hospital formedical treatments where he was diagnosed as having a fracture shaft of right radius. His right forearm was swollen, tender, deformedwith marked decrease in the range of movement. The radial pulse is palpable. Open reduction and internal fixation of fracture rightradius was performed on 14<sup>th</sup> April 2002 with a long scar left on his right forearm after the surgery. There were abrasions over his left knee as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> He was hospitalized for 4 days and discharged on 17<sup>th</sup> April 2002. He had, since then, been attending regular outpatient treatments about once in every 4 to 6 weeks. A series of physiotherapytreatment was also followed initially about twice in every week for a period of a month and thereafter about once in every week untilabout December 2002 when the pain in his right forearm had got worse. He had also received occupational therapy treatments.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Despite having attending a series of physiotherapy treatment, the Plaintiff says he still felt soreness and ache discomfort overvolar side right forearm. He also had swelling of right hand after doing physical exercise for about an hour and had pain while havingphysiotherapy. He also had a weakened right hand grip. Because of the forearm pain, he cannot engage in any kind of activities requiringrepetitive movement of his right hand. His dominant hand is right hand.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> An implant removal surgery was performed on 29<sup>th</sup> August 2003 and the attended rehabilitation program thereafter. Sick leave certificates were granted from the date of the accidentto 24<sup>th</sup> February 2004 continuously. The Plaintiff says he still feels stiffness and soreness over his right forearm when pressure was appliedover the previous fracture area. He feels discomfort when pushing heavy object or during turning motion of forearm. The strengthof the right limb is slightly weakened.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> He was further examined by Dr Tsoi on 27<sup>th</sup> February 2004. In his second medical report dated 28<sup>th</sup> February 2004, Dr Tsoi observes that when compared with the physical findings in his first report (14 months ago), there was improvementin range of motion of the right wrist and strength of the right hand grip. X-ray also revealed anatomical alignment of the distalradius as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Dr Tsoi comments that the Plaintiff is considered.Fit to resume his pre-injury job as a jewellery worker and the residual stiffnessand weakness will slightly affect his efficiency in performing hammering work and he may have to rest for 10 to 15 minutes aftercontinous hammering activities for 2 to 3 hours.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> According to Dr. Tsoiâs assessment on 27<sup>th</sup> February 2004, the Plaintiffâs residue stiffness of the right wrist and mildly weakened right hand grip accounts for 5% permanentimpairment of the right upper limb, which translates to 3% permanent impairment of the whole person. Dr Tsoi adds that should thePlaintiff decided to change occupation, job such as warehouse attendant, internal decorator, cleaning worker, restaurant assistant,office assistant etc would be suitable for him. Lastly Dr Tsoi states the sick leave of 22 months granted to the Plaintiff was reasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The other medical expert Dr Chun does not state that the sick leave period was unreasonable. However Dr Chun does not consider thePlaintiff has suffered any permanent disability or loss or earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> On 2<sup>nd</sup> December 2005 Dr Tsoi made a supplementary report. In that report he states that he does not agree with Dr Chun that Mr Lau did notsuffer from any permanent disability or loss of earning capacity. Dr Tsoi stresses that â(f) racture distal radius is a major injury.Despite good healing was achieved after surgical fixation, there should be certain tissues that were damaged by the injury. The scartissues formed will be the source of pain upon exertion. This will slightly affect his capacity to work as a goldsmith. His rightwrist function will never return to as âNormalâ as before the accident. In fact Dr Chun could not rule out the possibility ofintermittent mild right wrist pain. This will constitute a slight loss in earning capacity.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Dr Tsoi however did not give a percentage of the loss in earning capacity of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Dr Tsoi in making his last report also noted that Dr Chun did not record the Plaintiffâs wrist strength.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Defendant submitted that Dr Tsoiâs opinion should be preferred as he has taken note of Dr Chunâs opinion before making his supplementaryreport.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Defendant also said that although Dr Chun states in paragraph 3.3 of his report that â[t] he hand grip power pattern on right issuggestive of sub-maximal effort.â. This saying is purely speculative. Plaintiff said if Dr Chun was in doubt that the Plaintffdid not try enough, he should have asked the Plaintiff to perform the test again so as to get more data to support his speculation.Yet he had not done so. Defendant is respectfully submitted that the court should not attach any weight to his comment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Defendant also said that neither Dr Tsoi nor Mr. Lai, Physiotherapist I of North District Hospital opined that the Plaintiff deliberatelyunperformed during grip power test.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Defendant also submitted to this Court that there was no evidence that the injury of the Plaintiff was not consistent with the pushingby someone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The Defendant says that in this case, apart from the issue of liability, the Plaintiff needs to establish:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">a. The nature and extent of the Plaintiffâs injury;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">b. The resultant liability, if any;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">c. The Plaintiffâs loss of earnings during the period of certified sick leave between 13.4.02 and 24.2.04;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">d. The Plaintiffâs loss of earnings attributable to the injury;</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">i. 24.2.04 to trial;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">ii. Post-trial;</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">e. Whether the Plaintiff would suffer any (quantifiable) loss of earning capacity by way of disadvantage in the job market due tothe injury in that he would find it easier to lose a job and harder to secure further employment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> The Defendant says that the extent of the Plaintiffâs injury and resultant disability were agreed by the Plaintiff in the box asthat set out by the physiotherapist Lai and by Dr. Tsoi including Dr. Tsoiâs acceptance of Dr. Chunâs findings. The Plaintiffâsremaining disability, âif anyâ, according to Dr. Chun, is âintermittent mild painâ with no impairment of the whole man. Inhis latest report, Dr. Tsoi noted that there was improvement of the previous assessment of 3% in February 2004. Dr. Tsoi no longerquantified any disability and could only find a âslightâ loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The Plaintiff however disagrees with the findings of both Dr. Tsoi and Dr. Chun and says he could not return to his previous jobas a goldsmith.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The Defendant does not dispute the reasonableness of the Plaintiffâs period of certified sick leave between 13<sup>th</sup> August 2002 and 24<sup>th</sup> February 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> The Plaintiff in the Court says he could not return to his job as a jewellery worker. He told this Court that he has worked in jewelleryjob since Feb 2004 and was dismissed shortly afterwards. He submitted to the Court letters from these employees, written a year laterafter the termination of these employments. In the letter from Wellgold, one of the employers, where he worked for 11 days in May2004, it stated that it might be due to the Plaintiffâs problem with the hand that affected the stability his job performance asa quality control supervisor and that therefore the performance of the Plaintiff was short of what the Company requires.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In letter from Shing Hing Jade Jewellery Ltd. where the Plaintiff worked for 5 days in June 2004, it was said the work the Plaintiffdid was of standard lower than that required by the company. The letter also stated that the Plaintiff did not inform them of hishand injuries. The letter was delivered to solicitors for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The Defendant says therefore this Court has a stark choice on resultant disability between the substantive agreement of the two medicalexperts and Mr. Lauâs professed inability ever to work as a goldsmith again. It was said that the finding will determine the quantumof award for PSLA and items (d) and (e).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> The Defendant commented that the Plaintiff has problems of credibility in his claimed remaining injury and disability. His claimis not objectively supported. Of his 3 professed problems: unsteady hand, lessened grip and reduced strength, the first problem wasnever previously reported to the doctors and Dr. Chun found to the contrary; the second problem may exist and Dr. Tsoi found 80%grip returned in February 2004. and Dr. Chun says he may not have been using maximal effort when tested by him although Dr. Tsoidisagreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Dr. Tsoi, however agreed that the Plaintiffâs grip hand improved since. As for the third problem, the Plaintiffâs forearm andwrist muscles were measured and observed to be the same on both sides and therefore, again, the third complaint was not substantiatedby any medical report.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> The Plaintiff added a new complaint in the witness box that he had restricted movement in the right wrist. This is contradicted byall the medical evidence, including the physiotherapist as far back as November 2004 and both doctors. The Defendant says the Plaintiffwas clearly not truthful.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Although the Plaintiff claimed he could not return to work as a goldsmith on his own subjective perception, Dr. Tsoi found the contraryas from 24<sup>th</sup> February 2004. It was said that as Plaintiffâs evidence was that he needed only to hammer intermittently, and for much shorterperiods continuously, the restriction in efficiency that Dr. Tsoi envisaged would not affect his job as a gold goldsmith.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> The Defendant says there must be independent cause for the Plaintiffâs failure to hold the job at Shing Hing in May 2004 and Wellgoldin June 2004. It was said that letters from these companies were obviously obtained a year later and solely for the purpose of thistrial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> The Defendants says the Plaintiff changes jobs frequently and has chosen to remain unemployed for significant periods since 2001.He also took up to 4 months off in 1998-99. The Plaintiff had stayed out of work for 10 months prior to this incident. After theend of his sick leave, 2 months passed before he took employment again; after failing in job in June 2004, he remained entirely unemployeduntil August 2005. The Defendant says the Plaintiffâs claim that he could not find other suitable work in those 13 months is notcredible.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The Plaintiff says also that a goldsmith needs only materials, tools and a bench to make a living on self-employment. In Court, thePlaintiff had inadvertently admitted that he did âwork on his own materials, with his own tools, on his own benchâ. He also knewof the trade practice of lending materials between goldsmiths. It was said the Plaintiffâs answers following cross-examinationsubsequent to the aforesaid admission was not credible. E.g.: The Plaintiffâs saying that he was ignorant of material costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> He also explained the way he worked at the bench as shown in the photos produced was merely for demonstration and that he did notwork at the bench as demonstrated although he admitted the tools and layout of the bench was suited to him and laid out in a wayhe liked. The Defendant asked this Court to note the way the Plaintiff used both hands to work the heavier tasks in the photos.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> The Defendant says the Plaintiff is capable of working as before (or earning a comparable sum as a supervisor and/ or trainer) andtherefore he should fail both on item (d) from the date found on which he was again so capable, and on item (e). The Defendant saysif the Court finds that he has some âslightâ inefficiency from a âslightâ residual disability, that is then for the Plaintiffto quantify in earnings terms established by credible evidence. It was said by the Defendant that if the Court prefers Mr. Lauâsaccount, the Defendants submits HK$1,000 per month is a fair figure to apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> The Defendant says although there is no dispute to loss of earnings during sick leave at their prevailing wages, the Court shouldmake a reduction to allow for part of the period when it is likely the Plaintiff would have chosen to be unemployed and âlive onhis savingsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Quantum</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> The Plaintiff says his cases falls below the category of serious injury category of <u>Lee Tin Lam</u> v. <u>Leung Kam Ming</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20HKLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] HKLR 657.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> The Plaintiff quoted the following relevant cases: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Chan Wai Lun Robin</u> v. <u>Kai Shing Management Services</u> and others (HCPI 153/2003) (Sakhrani J; 10 May 2004)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Male, aged 35 at accident.

It was noted however that the injuried wrist in the <u>Tang</u> case related to non-preferred hand and in the present case, the preferred hand was injured.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> In the <u>Tang</u> case, the PSLA awarded was $180,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Another case of assistance to this Court was the <u>Wong Lai Kai</u> Case. In the <u>Wong</u> Case, the injured, a waiter aged 36, had abrasions over the left elbow and right leg and superficial abrasions over the left thighand a fracture of the head of the left fibula. He left hospital on the day but was readmitted later as he had avulsed posterior cruciateligament of the left knee. Open reduction and screw fixation were performed. His left knee was put in plaster cast and he was discharged3 days later. He was readmitted later due to swelling of the left calf and was suffering from deep vein thrombosis of the left leg.He was treated with anti-coagulants and was discharged after 12 days, receiving physiotherapy for further 2 to 3 weeks, oral medicationfor a month and he was given sick leave till nearly 5 years later. At trial, he still complained of swelling in the left leg afterprolonged standing and walking and he was assessed to be suffering from 3% permanent disability and 5% loss of earning capacity.He could not return to job as a waiter. He was awarded $264,250 in 1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Obviously, the injuries in the <u>Wong</u> case were more serious.  The period of sick leave, the nature of medical treatment &amp; other therapy, the length of stay in hospitalfor these treatment are also more prolonged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> I find in the circumstances, the sum of $220,000 appropriate under the heading of PSLA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Pre-trial loss of earnings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> Parties had no dispute that the 22 months of sick leave was reasonable. The Defendant however submitted that the Plaintiff had thework pattern of not working over a period of time that perhaps the award should take that into account. At time of accident, thePlaintiff was unemployed and had been so for the last 10 months prior.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> He alleged however that at time of accident, he was about to attend a job interview in a few daysâ time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> The Plaintiff also claimed that the monthly wages of the Plaintiff at the time, having regard to his work experience and historyis $13,000 per month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> It is noted that the Plaintiff in Court did say that the jobs in Hong Kong at the time only fetched $8,000 odd per month and thatthe salary of working in China is higher.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> The Plaintiff also produced letter from HK Gold &amp; Silver  Ornament Workers &amp; Merchants General Union dated 7<sup>th</sup> March 2005, which says skilled jewellery workers and 15 years working experience or more who worked in Hong Kong factories had averagemonthly salary of $13,500 between years of 2000 to 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> The salary of the injured at Shing Hing was $8,000 per month and that at Wellgold was $18,000 per month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> The Plaintiff used to earn $13,000 per month at Cheng and Cheng Fine Jewellery Ltd., his last job before the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> This Court finds in the circumstances, that $13,000 is the reasonable monthly salary fetched by the Plaintiff at the material time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> This Court having considered the evidence adduced accepts the submission by the Defendant regarding the frequent changing jobs patternof the Plaintiff, as evidenced in his job application forms to Wellgold dated 7<sup>th</sup> May 2004, and the fact that he frequently remains unemployed over âthe few years prior to the accidentâ, such as the 10 monthsprior to the accident. Accordingly this Court adjudged that the 22.4 months (i.e. 13<sup>th</sup> April 2002 to 24<sup>th</sup> February 2004) claimed by the Plaintiff would be adjusted to 18 months. Accordingly, the loss of earnings during the sick leave i.e.until 24<sup>th</sup> February 2004 would be $13,000 x 18 = $234,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Trial starts in late December 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> The Plaintiff explained that the reasons why he was dismissed shortly after he took up 2 jobs in jewellery factories after the expiryof the certified sick leave was because he still has suffered impairment which disallows him to return to his previous job as a jewelleryskilled worker. It was noted that his stated complaints was either only first raised in Court or was not supported by any medicalevidence, not even that of his own medical expert, Dr. Tsoi, save the weakened hand grip point and the slight loss in earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> The letters from the 2 employers were clearly made and intended for the use of the proceedings. This Court finds that the employerthough found that there the standard of work done by the Plaintiff was not high enough to satisfy their requirement would not bein a position to certify the reasons therefore the reasons given by them was mere speculation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> In fact, the allegation that he cannot return to his previous occupation is contradicted by all medical experts opinions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> This Court prefers the evidence of the medical experts and finds that the Plaintiff can return to his previous job.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> On his own admission, his job does not require continuous hammering for a long time and therefore the inefficiency expected by Dr.Tsoi will not affect his job performance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Coming to the medical opinions of Dr. Tsoi and Dr. Chun, I prefer the opinion of Dr. Chun, in particular I accept that the Plaintiffdid use submaximal effort in the hand grip test. There is no reason that his hand grips weakened as he recovers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> I do not find his complaints proved.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> The Plaintiff had also failed to explain why he had only started to work 2 months after the sick leave expired, this again showedhis lack of eagerness to return to work.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> In Court, during the few daysâ trial, this Court did not notice anything unusual about the movement of the right hand or the rightwrist of the Plaintiff in handling the various heavy hearing box files of documents.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> This Court does not accept the evidence of the Plaintiff he felt soreness and weakness when he applied strength with his right wristand which affected his work performance and that therefore he could not return to his work.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> Further, when the Plaintiff was giving evidence regarding the photos, originally intended to demonstrate his work as a jewelleryworker, he had, as the Defendant had rightly pointed out, slipped his tongue and said he did work on his own materials, with hisown tools on his own bench. He later changed his evidence on being cross-examined further. He even went further as to deny his knowledgeof the value of precious materials he worked with for the last 15 years. This is totally not credible. This Court finds that thePlaintiff had referred to his job as a jewellery worker and worked on his own after the accident. Although when cross-examined thePlaintiff says that he had borrowed the used of the bench at his friendâs companyâs workplace for taking the photos, he failedto tell this Court either the name or address of his friendâs factory. He also said the things on the bench in the photos was arrangedin a way suited to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> I find the Plaintiff less than full and frank when giving evidence, in particular regarding the alleged disability and continuingeffect of the injuries after the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Just to alleviate any doubt, the credibility of the Plaintiff, as this Court finds it, had already been considered and weighted whenthis Court arrived at the findings at to how the accident occurred earlier.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> Accordingly, this Court accepts the Defendantâs submission that the Plaintiff had failed to prove that the effect of the injuriesprevent him from returning his previous job.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> There is therefore no award for loss of earnings for the period from 25<sup>th</sup> February 2004 till date of the trial. The total pre-trial loss is therefore $234,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> Similarly, as the Plaintiff is found to be able to return to his previous job, there is no Post-trial loss of earnings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> For the sake of completeness, this Court will add in passing that after considering the volume of cases referred to this Court bythe parties, the appropriate multiplier in this case is 11.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Loss of earning capacity</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> The Plaintiff claims the sum of $156,000 (i.e. $13,000 x 12 months) under this head. He agrees that if this Court finds that thePlaintiff has been fully compensated for his Post-trial loss, without suffering any further loss in being disadvantaged in the labourmarket, then obviously no award will be awarded. If not, the Plaintiff says that the Court can award an appropriate sum under thishead. The Plaintiff says according to Dr. Tsoi, the accident slightly affect the Plaintiffâs capacity to work as a goldsmith andthat the right wrist function from of the Plaintiff will never return to normal as before the accident. The Plaintiff says thereis a slight loss in earning capacity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> The Defendant says according to Dr. Chun, there is no permanent loss of earning capacity and that even according to the Plaintiffâsmedical expert Dr. Tsoi, the mild intermittent pain will only result in a slight loss in earning capacity which Dr. Tsoi is not willingto attach the loss of earning capacity in percentage form.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Having considered the medical evidence before me, I accept the evidence of Dr. Chun that there is no loss of earning capacity inthis case and accordingly there is no award under this head. On evidence before this Court, this Court does not find an increasein risk in the Plaintiff being dismissed or unemployed in future and suffer disadvantage in the labour market.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Special Damages</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> Both parties agree $16,584 as special damages to be awarded to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">T<u>otal</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> In summary, the awards I make in favour of the Plaintiff as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="70%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">(a)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">PSLA</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align: left">$220,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">(b)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">Pre-trial Loss</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align: left">$234,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">(c)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">Post-trial Loss</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align: left">$0</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">(d)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">Loss of Earning Capacity</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align: left">$0</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">(e)</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">Special Damages</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top" style="text-align: left">$16,584</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Damages (Interest)</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">134.
