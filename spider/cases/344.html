BACKGROUND</i></p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was/is a Chinese medicine practitioner pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/549/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 90</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/549" class="autolink_findacts">Chinese Medicine Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/549">Cap. 549</a>.  According to the Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was/is a bonesetter trading as å³å¯¶ç©è·æé«é¤¨ (ie the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant but erroneously named as âå³å¯¶ç©é«é¤¨ (a firm)â in the Writ of Summons, â<u>Clinic</u>â).  There is no dispute that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was/is a registered Chinese medicine practitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Plaintiff claims to have suffered personal injuries as a patient under the care of and as a result of medical mismanagementby the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and/or 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants and/or their servants, agents and/or employees during the period from 31 March to 12 April 2007 (â<u>Incident</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 20 October 2010, the Plaintiff commenced the present proceedings against the Defendants for damages for personal injuries andfor other loss and damages.  On 10 November 2010, the Plaintiff filed her Statement of Claim, Statement of Damages and her medicalreports pursuant to Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/549/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 12(1A)(a)</a> of the Rules of the High Court (â<u>Medical Reports</u>â).  On 13 December 2010, the Plaintiff filed Notice of Discontinuance against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  But on 6 December 2010, the Defendants issued a summons seeking <i>inter alia</i> the following reliefs (â<u>Summons</u>â):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the Writ of Summons and the Statement of Claim be struck out as being frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of process of the courtand the action be dismissed with costs on the ground that they set up a cause of action that has been time-barred under section 27of the Limitation Ordinance (â<u>Ordinance</u>â) at the time of the issuance of the Writ of Summons;</p>        <p>(b) the time for filing/serving the Defence be âabridgedâ (which I believe should be âextendedâ but no issue arises from sucherror).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In support of the Summons, the Defendants filed the affirmation of their solicitor Lee Ka Kui on 6 December 2010 and the affirmationof the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on 1 February 2011.  The Plaintiff filed her own affirmation in opposition on 10 January 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr Cheng, counsel for the Plaintiff, frankly accepts that the Plaintiffâs cause of action against the Defendants has started toaccrue on/about 12 April 2007 when she became aware of her right shoulder dislocation which she claims was caused by treatment givenby the Defendants, and that the three-year limitation period has expired by 11 April 2009 and the present proceedings are thereforeabout 6 months out of time.  Mr Cheng further accepts that unless the Plaintiff has leave to proceed under section 30 of the Ordinance,her claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants in the present proceedings is liable to be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>II.  PLAINTIFFâS CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS</i></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The following chronology of events is extracted from the Plaintiffâs affirmation, the undisputed <i>inter partes</i> correspondence, the Medical Reports, and the expert report of the Plaintiffâs orthopaedic expert Dr Wong See Hoi (â<u>Dr Wong</u>â) dated 24 July 2009 (â<u>Ortho Report</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  According to the medical report of Dr Wun Yiu-chung of the department of orthopaedics and traumatology (â<u>DOT</u>â) of Tuen Mun Hospital (â<u>TMH</u>â) dated 23 January 2008 (â<u>DOT Report</u>â), which the Plaintiff has disclosed as one of the Medical Reports, she had carcinoma of the right breast with surgical excisionand axillary lymph node dissection done in May 2006.  She also received <i>post</i>-operative radiotherapy and hormonal treatment.  According to the Ortho Report, she still had follow-up at TMH at quarterly intervals,but had returned to work one month after the surgery.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Ortho Report further notes that the Plaintiff had no history of right shoulder problem, but after radiotherapy treatment shenoticed there was loss of about 50-60% range of movement of the right shoulder.  There was progressive painful stiffness of her rightshoulder, and she was advised by her oncologist to perform self-mobolisation exercise.  TMHâs department of clinical oncology referredher to the physiotherapy department (â<u>PD</u>â) for physiotherapy for right frozen shoulder.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Dr Wong opines that the Plaintiff suffered from adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) that not uncommonly develops after axillarylymph node radiotherapy or surgery, but most of such cases are self-limiting and respond well to conservative treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that on 31 March 2007 she attended the Clinic for bonesetter treatment because of right shoulder stiffness. She was examined by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and was diagnosed to be suffering from severe shoulder impingement syndrome (å´éè©å¨ç). Initially, the Plaintiffwas treated with herbal medication application, but the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant suggested to her to have stretching treatment (åç­æ²»ç) and told her that without such treatment she would have frozenshoulder and severe restriction of her right shoulder mobility.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 1 April 2007, the Plaintiff attended the Clinic for follow-up treatment.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant advised she had severe shoulder impingement syndrome and it was necessary for her to have stretching treatment, but itwould be very painful after the stretching treatment, so she should bring along a relative when she attended the Clinic for suchtreatment.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 2 April 2007, the Plaintiffâs eldest son accompanied her to the Clinic.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant administered stretching treatment, ie aggressive manipulation of her right shoulder, which caused severe pain. The Plaintifffelt the muscles around her right shoulder were torn, and she heard a âpopâ sound.  She was unable to move and felt severe painand numbness in her right shoulder/arm after such manipulation, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant assured her the symptoms were normal and told her to attend further follow-up treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  During the period from 3 to 11 April 2007, the Plaintiff attended the Clinic for follow-up treatment of her right shoulder.  Shewas treated with herbal medication application and manipulation as before, but her condition did not improve.  On 11 April 2007,in view of her continuous pain and discomfort, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant told her to have further stretching treatment for her right shoulder.  The Plaintiff was reluctant and unwilling, and askedthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to arrange x-ray of her right shoulder to ascertain her actual condition.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 12 April 2007, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant arranged to have x-ray taken of the Plaintiffâs right shoulder.  The radiographer/radiologist informed the Plaintiffthat dislocation of her right shoulder was detected.  This was the first time she was aware of such fact.  She believed it was causedby the treatment given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on various dates between 2 and 11 April 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Dr Wong opines it is likely that the Plaintiffâs shoulder dislocation was caused by forceful manipulation by the bonesetter. Although radiotherapy can cause stiffness to the areas being treated, he is of the view that it is highly unlikely that radiationtherapy to the shoulder will result in shoulder dislocation.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 13 April 2007, the Plaintiff attended TMHâs accident and emergency department for exacerbation of right shoulder pain for morethan a week after receiving bonesetter treatment.  Medical examination revealed tenderness over right shoulder region, dislocationof the right humeral head, impairment of right shoulder active range of movement in all directions, and restriction of passive movementas a result of pain.  X-ray of the right shoulder confirmed locked anterior dislocation of the right shoulder joint.  Closed reductionunder sedation failed, and the Plaintiff was admitted to TMHâs orthopaedic ward on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  CT scan of the right shoulder confirmed locked anterior dislocation of the right shoulder joint.  Nerve conduction study of theright upper limb on 23 April 2007 demonstrated no evidence of right axillary nerve or suprascapular nerve palsy.  On 30 April 2007,surgical open reduction with Bankart repair and inferior capsular shift was performed under general anaesthesia.  <i>Post</i>-operative progress was uneventful, and the Plaintiffâs right upper limb was protected by shoulder immoboliser for 4 weeks <i>post</i>-operatively.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiff was discharged on 4 May 2007 with referral for regular physiotherapy 2-3 times a week for several months.  Gentlemobolisation exercise of the right upper limb was started at the outpatient clinic after 4 weeks of immobolisation.  The shoulderjoint was well reduced and normally located, but progress for restoration of active motion of the right shoulder was slow.  Accordingto the physiotherapy report of Mr Chung King Man of TMHâs PD dated 21 November 2008 (â<u>PD Report</u>â), the Plaintiff received 25 sessions of physiotherapy treatment between 29 May and 28 August 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 5 September 2007, the Plaintiff was admitted to TMHâs DOT.  Surgery for arthroscopic release of right shoulder joint stiffnesswas performed on 6 September 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  <i>Post</i>-operatively, the Plaintiff stayed in hospital for aggressive right shoulder physiotherapy by manual exercise and continuous passivemotion machine exercise.  She was discharged home on 25 September 2007. Continuous physiotherapy on outpatient basis was provided. According to the PD Report, the Plaintiff received 31 sessions of physiotherapy treatment between 2 October 2007 and 19 February2008.  Gradual improvement of right shoulder active motion was noted when the Plaintiff was seen at the orthopaedic specialist clinicon 2 October 2007.  Continuous physiotherapy for mobolisation as well as strengthening exercise was indicated.  According to thePD Report, she was referred for physiotherapy for right shoulder stiffness and received 45 sessions of physiotherapy treatment between26 February and 18 November 2008.  The Plaintiff had follow-up at TMHâs DOT, and also consulted general practitioners for attacksof right shoulder pain and stiffness about 1-2 times a month.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Dr Wong opines that if immediate reduction and appropriate follow-up treatment is given, acute shoulder dislocation can usuallyrecover satisfactorily with no permanent effect.  However, delayed reduction for over a week even with subsequent successful reductionmay lead to permanent structural damage to the shoulder joint.  The Plaintiff had missed the golden opportunity of treatment so thateven with successful reduction she would still suffer from permanent pain, stiffness and weakness of the right shoulder.  Becauseof delayed diagnosis, she had to undergo surgical reduction and suffer further damage to the soft tissues of the right shoulder. The Plaintiff claims the above is the result of the Defendantsâ medical mismanagement.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  After the Incident, the Plaintiff wanted to claim against the Defendants for their medical mismanagement, but she had no knowledgeabout solicitorsâ firms or the procedure for making a legal claim.  She then came to know the firm of solicitors retained to representand defend her children in criminal cases in/about 2007 (â<u>Former Solicitors</u>â), which cases were handled by the Former Solicitorsâ litigation clerk (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Clerk</u>â) and a female counsel (â<u>Counsel</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In/about late 2007 or early 2008, when the Plaintiff brought up the Incident after the hearing of her daughterâs criminal case,the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk and Counsel were willing to arrange a free consultation meeting for her.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk arranged for her to attend Counselâs chambers one afternoon in January 2008 (â<u>Conference</u>â), and further asked her to bring a sum of HK$8,000.00 to him for legal costs on account.  At the Conference, the Plaintiff explainedthe background and details of the Incident to the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk and Counsel, and Counsel advised she had a good case against the Defendants for damages for personal injuries.  The Plaintiffrecalled that when she told the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk and Counsel she would not be able to afford huge legal costs, Counsel asked the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk whether the Former Solicitors had any solicitor on the legal aid panel, and the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk replied that it was not necessary for the Plaintiff to apply for legal aid because the Former Solicitors would act for herand that she would only need to apply for legal aid if the Defendants defended her legal claim.  The Plaintiff further claims thatneither Counsel nor the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk advised her about her eligibility and/or the relevant procedure for applying for legal aid (even though legal aid was mentionedat the Conference) or about the time limit for commencing legal proceedings against the Defendants in relation to the Incident. Relying on the assurance given by the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk during the Conference, the Plaintiff entrusted the matter to the Former Solicitors and gave HK$8,000.00 to the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk as costs on account, which payment is evidenced by a receipt dated 19 January 2008 issued by the Former Solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On/about 21 February 2008, the Plaintiff had right shoulder manipulation for joint adhesions under anaesthesia at TMH.  Thereafteruntil late 2008, she attended regular physiotherapy sessions at TMH.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Since the Plaintiff entrusted the Former Solicitors to handle her claim against the Defendants, she did not pay special attentionto the matter.  She recalled that she had a MRI scan done at St Teresaâs Hospital on 8 August 2008, and thereafter in/about August2008 attended the offices of the Former Solicitors to give a copy of the MRI report to the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On 8 September 2008, the Former Solicitors issued a <i>pre</i>-action letter to the Defendants (â<i><u>Pre</u></i><u>-action Letter</u>â) enclosing a copy of the DOT Report and stating that the Plaintiff intended to claim against them for damages âin connectionwith a medical negligence which happened on or about the end of March to early April 2007 â¦â¦ when she attended [the Clinic] â¦â¦â. The Former Solicitors also set out a summary of the background discussed in paragraphs 12-15, 18-19 and 21 above, and claimed thatthe Defendants:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âhad failed to impose a proper diagnosis and/or treatment on the [Plaintiff]; failed to provide any or any adequate treatment afterthe [Plaintiff] had indicated to [the Defendants and the Clinic] that she was suffering from excessive pain after the treatment givenby [the Defendants and the Clinic]; failed to exercise due diligence and care in treating the [Plaintiff]; failed to give any orany proper advice to the [Plaintiff] at the material time so as to avoid or prolong the unnecessary and unreasonable pain and suffering;failed to provide proper and professional treatment to the [Plaintiff] at a standard required by [the Defendantsâ] profession;failed to give any or any proper advice to the [Plaintiff] at the material time so as to avoid the delay the [Plaintiff] from receivingthe proper treatment she needed. As a result, the [Plaintiffâs] condition worsened and is still suffering until today.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Former Solicitors also warned that unless a constructive reply was received within 21 days they would forthwith commence legalproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 18 September 2008, the solicitors for the Defendants (â<u>Dsâ Solicitors</u>â) replied stating that they had âinstructions to deny all [the Plaintiffâs] allegations contained in [the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter] save and except that she did attended with [the Clinic] for treatment between the period of 31<sup>st</sup> March 2007 to 12<sup>th</sup> April 2007â, and  that any legal proceedings issued by the Plaintiff would be strenuously defended.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In/about October 2008, the Plaintiff was asked to attend the offices of the Former Solicitors, and the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk introduced her to another staff member of the Former Solicitors (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup></u> <u>Staff</u>â).  During the meeting, the need to obtain medical reports concerning her injuries was explained to the Plaintiff, and she wasarranged to sign a number of consent forms to enable the Former Solicitors to obtain medical reports from her treatment hospitals.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  During another meeting with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff in November 2008, the Plaintiff was told that after obtaining the medical reports from her treatment hospitals, the FormerSolicitors would instruct a medical expert to examine her and to prepare a report for her claim against the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In/about February 2009, the Plaintiff received a call from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff and was informed that a medical examination by Dr Wong had been arranged for 29 May 2009.  The Plaintiff attended such medicalexamination, and was told by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff that the Former Solicitors would contact her upon receipt of the report by Dr Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  By about November 2009, the Plaintiff still had not heard from the Former Solicitors, so she telephoned the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff and asked about the progress of the case.  She was told that formal legal proceedings would be commenced shortly.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that ever since she entrusted her claim against the Defendants to the Former Solicitors she was always underthe impression they were actively preparing the relevant materials to institute legal proceedings against them.  During such period,the Former Solicitors never told her they would be unable to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On 28 January 2010, the Former Solicitors wrote to Dsâ Solicitors referring to the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter and enclosing the Ortho Report, and intimated that the Plaintiff was prepared to commence legal proceedings againstthe Defendants.  They asked for a reply within three days on the identity of the relevant insurer and as to whether Dsâ Solicitorshad instructions to accept service.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On 1 February 2010, Dsâ Solicitors confirmed there was no insurer during the material period and they had instructions to acceptservice.  They complained that the Plaintiff had failed to invite for joint examination before the medical examination by Dr Wong,and gave their opinion that the Plaintiff would be âunable to put her case against [the Defendants]â.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Plaintiff claims she did not have any knowledge of the correspondence between the Former Solicitors and Dsâ Solicitors referredto in paragraphs 27-28 and 34-35 above before having sight of the affirmation of Lee Ka Kui.  She further claims that during herretainer with them the Former Solicitors never reported to her there were replies from Dsâ Solicitors on behalf of the Defendants,and they did not provide any such correspondence to her when they ceased to act for her.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  By about early July 2010, the Plaintiff still had not heard from the Former Solicitors, so she telephoned the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff to enquire about the progress of her case.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff asked whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Clerk had contacted her, and she told him she had not been contacted by either of them in the past few months.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff then suggested having a meeting with her in early July 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In early July 2010, the Plaintiff and her daughter attended a meeting with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff at the offices of the Former Solicitors.  At first, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff tried to convince her to drop her claim against the Defendants by saying that they found out the Defendants were unlikely tohave the financial means to pay any damages.  But the Plaintiff insisted on pursuing her claim, so the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff asked her to sign some Chinese documents and told her they were for commencing legal proceedings against the Defendants. ThePlaintiff could not recall what those documents were, but she signed on them as advised by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff guaranteed to her that the Former Solicitors would file the Writ of Summons in court and send a copy thereof to her for herrecord within a week.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  However, on 9 July 2010, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff suddenly telephoned to inform the Plaintiff that the Former Solicitors decided to cease acting for her and to terminate herretainer.  The Plaintiff told the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff she would call the following day because she was not able to discuss the matter with him at the time.  On/about 10 July 2010,the Plaintiff telephoned the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff and asked why the Former Solicitors ceased to act for her in this matter.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff was unable to give any satisfactory explanation, but insisted they would cease to act for her and would return to her the documentsshe had previously passed to them.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff also said the Former Solicitors would later refund to her the remaining balance of the costs on account.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  On 15 July 2010, the Former Solicitors wrote to the Plaintiff stating they could no longer act for her in respect of her medicalnegligence claim over the treatment she received at the Clinic because they were unable to further agree on and confirm instructions. The Former Solicitors sent her a fee note for the Ortho Report, a cheque in the sum of HK$6,334.00 being refund of the remainingcosts on account, and some original documents.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Plaintiff did not know what to do. She recalled that legal aid was raised during the Conference, so in/about early August 2010she approached the Legal Aid Department for assistance.  She was informed by the legal aid counsel that there was a time limit ofthree years for instituting legal proceedings against the Defendants in relation to the Incident, and that her claim was alreadytime-barred.  It was the first time she heard about such time limit.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In late September 2010, the Plaintiff was granted legal aid, and thereafter the matter was handled by the Plaintiffâs solicitors(â<u>Pâs Solicitors</u>â) on assignment by the Director of Legal Aid.  The Writ of Summons was issued and served on 20 October 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On 28 October 2010, Dsâ Solicitors wrote to Pâs Solicitors to clarify the grounds for issuing the Writ of Summons after theexpiry of the three-year limitation period in respect of the Incident.  Dsâ Solicitors warned that if there were no reply withinthree working days, they would apply to strike out the Plaintiffâs claim without further notice.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  On 30 October 2010, Pâs Solicitors replied stating they were assigned by the Director of Legal Aid but the legal aid certificatewas only issued on 28 September 2010.  They further explained that the Plaintiff was unaware of any time limitation for institutinglegal proceedings against the Defendants, and was only informed of the same by the handling officer when she applied for legal aid.Investigation by Pâs Solicitors revealed that the Plaintiff had previously retained solicitors to act for her in this matter in2008 and the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter was issued in/about September 2008, but she did not receive any information as to whether there was any constructivereply from the Defendants.  Despite repeated requests for information about progress of the matter, the Plaintiff did not receiveany constructive reply from her former solicitors or any advice about the time limit for issuing legal proceedings.  In/about mid-July2010, the Plaintiff received a letter from her former solicitors unilaterally terminating her retainer without any explanation, andwas informed upon enquiry that they did not want to act for her any further in this matter.  Subsequently, the Plaintiff appliedfor legal aid and thereafter commenced the present proceedings in October 2010.  Pâs Solicitors claimed that the Plaintiff hadacted reasonably and promptly once she realised there was a cause of action against the Defendants, and the Defendants should havebeen well aware of her claim since they had received the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter in September 2008, so the late issuance of the Writ of Summons would not cause them any prejudice. Pâs Solicitorsinvited the Defendants not to take issue on the time limitation in order to save time and costs.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>III.  LEGAL PRINCIPLES</i></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  There is much consensus between Mr Cheng and Mr Lau, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, as to the general principles on discretionary extension of the time limit under section 30 of the Ordinance.

The court performsa balancing exercise by looking at (a) the balance of prejudice to each party, (b) the six specific but non-exhaustive factors containedin section 30(3) of the Ordinance, and (c) all the circumstances of the case to see whether it would be âequitableâ to disapplythe limitation period.  The onus is on the Plaintiff to show that in the particular circumstances of the case it is equitable toallow her claim to proceed having regard to the respective prejudice likely to be suffered by each party, but the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have to prove the prejudice they say they will suffer.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Essentially, the question is whether, given the delays, the judge can fairly try the claim, and all depends on the particular circumstancesof each case.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  But notwithstanding the above common understanding, I will deal with several preliminary points.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(a)  Burden</i> <i>of proof</i></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  First, Mr Lau places emphasis on the following observations by Auld LJ in <i>KR &amp; ors v Bryn Alyn Company (Holdings) Ltd (in liquidation) &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20All%20ER%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 All ER 716</a>, 741-742:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ (ii) The burden of showing that it would be equitable to disapply the limitation period lies on the claimant and it is aheavy burden. Another way of putting it is that it is an exceptional indulgence to a claimant, to be granted only where equity betweenthe parties demands it â¦â¦â,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and suggests there is a heavy burden on the Plaintiff in seeking discretionary extension of the time limit under section 30 of theOrdinance.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  However, after <i>A v Hoare</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20All%20ER%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 All ER 1</a>, the above observations by Auld LJ have been reinterpreted by the English Court of Appeal in <i>B v Nugent Care Society; GR v Wirral MBC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%20PIQR%20P3" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] PIQR P3</a> at para. 20 on p. P55 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the light of the considerations in A v Hoare to which we have referred we conclude that the âstarting pointsâ taken from[74] of Bryn Alyn and quoted above remain valid subject to these considerations. As to ii), it is correct to describe the exerciseof the discretion as an exceptional indulgence to the claimant because, but for the exercise of the discretion, his claim will betime-barred. <i>But it is only exceptional for that reason. The cases stress that the discretion is wide and unfettered.</i>â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In light of the above, â[it] therefore seems that the burden is no more heavy than any other evidential or legal burden, and thequestion is therefore simply â¦.. whether the claimant can prove that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it would beequitable to make an exceptionâ (see <i>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</i> Vol.1 para.748).</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Further, recent English authorities suggest there should be a more flexible, generous or liberal approach to the exercise of thediscretion (see cases discussed in <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i> at para.86 at pp.94-95 and <i>Pang Kwok Lam</i> at para.108).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(b)  Forensic prejudice and loss of limitation defence</i></p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In <i>Horton v Sadler</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20PIQR%20P30" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] PIQR P30</a> at p.P514, Lord Hoffmann said that since <i>Thompson v Brown</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20744" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 744</a>, the practice of the courts had been regularly to exercise the discretion in favour of the plaintiff in all cases in which the defendantcould not show that he had been prejudiced by the delay, and in the absence of forensic prejudice, the statutory limitation defencewas a âwindfall of which he can properly be deprivedâ (see also <i>Chuck Wai Man v Asia Television Ltd</i> CACV 29/2008 (unreported, 9 September 2008) <i>per</i> Tang VP).</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  It has also been said that the prejudice resulting from the loss of the limitation defence will almost always be balanced by theprejudice to the plaintiff from the operation of the limitation provision, so the loss of the limitation defence as such will beof little importance, and the true matter of importance is the effect of the delay on the defendantâs ability to defend (see <i>Cain v Francis; Mckay v Hamlani &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%202%20All%20ER%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 2 All ER 579</a>, 600-601, <i>Hartley v Birmingham City District Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20All%20ER%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 All ER 212</a>, 224, and <i>Ng Ngan Chiu v Paramount Printing Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20557" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 557</a>, 563).</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The matter is put succinctly in <i>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</i> Vol.1 para.748 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTherefore <i>the effect of the removal of the limitation defence if the application is granted is to be disregarded in considering the prejudiceto the defendant, including its possible financial effect on the defendant</i>. It is the effect of the delay on the defendantâs ability to fairly meet the claim that is relevant to prejudice. The mere factthat he will have to defend the claim is the effect of the operation of the section, not a form of prejudice. On the claimantâsside, however, the prejudice caused by the operation of s 11 [the English equivalent of section 27 of the Ordinance] can be takeninto account â as it logically must be or there would be no prejudice to the claimant to weigh in the balance.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>(c)  Financial prejudice</i></p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The above extract from <i>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</i> Vol.1 para.748 suggests that possible financial prejudice to the defendant as a result of loss of the limitation defence is not arelevant consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Here, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his affirmation claims that because professional indemnity insurance is not required under law for Chinese medicinepractitioners, neither the 1<sup>st</sup> nor the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has any insurance coverage for their medical practice.  He adds that there have been no complaints and/or claims for medicalnegligence over 30 years of practice by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and over 13 years of practice by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Lau submits that it is a relevant factor that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are uninsured.  He draws support from Parker LJâs observations in <i>Hartley</i> at p.224 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNext, it appears to me that if it is, as it is, legitimate to take into account, when considering the prejudice to the plaintiff,that [the plaintiff] will have a claim against his solicitors, it must in my judgment follow that it is legitimate to take into accountthat the defendant is insured. If he is deprived of his fortuitous defence he will have a claim on his insurer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, I am unable to conclude from the above passage that any uninsured (as opposed to insured) status of the defendant is a relevantconsideration.  In my view, the above passage merely suggests that if it is relevant to consider whether any prejudice to the plaintifffrom a refusal to extend the time limit can be ameliorated by a claim by such plaintiff against his solicitors, it is also relevantto consider whether any prejudice to the defendant from any discretionary extension of the time limit can be ameliorated by a claimby such defendant on his insurer.  This is borne out by Parker LJâs further observation at p.224 that âif the only benefit ofa decision against the plaintiff is to benefit the defendantâs insurer, this can in my view be no ground for saying that it isnot âfair and justâ or âequitableâ that the action should proceed â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr Cheng relies on Russell LJâs observations in <i>Halford v Brooks &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20All%20ER%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 All ER 559</a>, 567-568 to suggest that a defendantâs impecuniosity is irrelevant. However, in that case, the court was concerned with a tortof intent, and the learned judge drew a distinction between such tort and a negligent act or contractual breach of duty, and wenton to say that the defendantâs financial inability to meet any judgment against him was not a legitimate reason for preventinga blameless plaintiff from pursuing a civil claim for damages for such intentional tort.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  A more definitive clarification in relation to personal injury claims based on negligence acts came in the judgment of Smith LJin <i>Cain</i> at p.598 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[70] Thus, although on a literal construction of s 33(1) [the English equivalent of section 30(1) of the Ordinance], it appearsto be relevant to the exercise of the discretion that the defendant would suffer the financial prejudice of having to pay damagesif the arbitrary time limit were to be disapplied, Parliament cannot have intended that that financial prejudice, as such, shouldbe taken into account. This is because, in fairness and justice, the defendant ought to pay damages if, having had a fair opportunityto defend himself, he is found liable. If having to pay damages is not a relevant prejudice under s 33(1), it cannot be relevanteither as one of the circumstances of the case.</p>        <p class="quote">[71] I accept that some judges appear to have thought that this financial prejudice, as such, was relevant to the exercise of thediscretion.  In particular, Lord Diplock [in <i>Thompson</i>] appears to have thought so and the rest of the House agreed with him. I must say, with hesitation and great respect, that I thinkhe was wrong.  I comfort myself with the knowledge that his remarks were not essential to the ratio of the decision in <i>Thompson</i>âs case.  Apart from Lord Diplockâs, all the other judicial utterances are broadly consistent with the reasoning I have advanced.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Also, it has been held that changes in insurance funding arrangements so that a defendant will have to bear more excess paymentsthan he would have to if the claim were brought within the time limit are irrelevant (see <i>Smith v Leicester Health Authority</i> [1998] Lloydâs Rep Med 77).  <i>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</i> Vol.1 para.788(b) refers to <i>Harding v Richard Costain Limited</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2009/1348.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] EWHC 1348 (QB)</a> in which the judge âsaw logic in the argument that the fact that the delay in bringing the claim had the effect that there wasno longer an insurance policy in place as it would have been if the claim was brought in time was irrelevant to prejudice following<i>Cain</i>â. If a financially adverse change to insurance funding arrangements after the time limit is irrelevant, I am unable to appreciatehow a defendantâs uninsured status that has remained unchanged both before and after the expiry of the limitation period can beregarded as a relevant prejudice.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Ultimately, the question is whether, upon review of the facts and circumstances of each case, it is fair and just in all the circumstancesto expect the defendant to meet the plaintiffâs claim on the merits notwithstanding the delay, and in answering this question crucialconsiderations include (a) whether the defendant has suffered any forensic disadvantage in his investigation of the claim and/orthe assembly of evidence such that it outweighs the prejudice to the plaintiff of being denied a trial at all, and (b) whether thedelay is for so excusable a reason that looking at the matter in the round fairness and justice require the action to proceed orthere is no good reason for the delay or for its length that has caused procedural disadvantage and unfairness to the defendant (seealso <i>McDonnell v Walker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%20PIQR%20P5" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] PIQR P5</a> at pp.P118-119 <i>per</i> Waller LJ).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>IV.  SIX SPECIFIC FACTORS</i></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  For the purpose of convenience, I discuss the six factors in section 30(3) of the Ordinance in turn, but I accept they cannot beanalysed in isolation from one another.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(a)  Length of delay and reasons by the plaintiff</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Under section 30(3)(a) of the Ordinance, the test is a subjective one, and the delay refers to delay since the expiry of the limitationperiod. But <i>pre</i>-expiry delay can be taken into account as one of the circumstances of the case in balancing the prejudice to the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Here, the <i>post</i>-expiry delay is about 6 months from 12 April to 20 October 2010, which is not a particularly long period of delay.  Mr Lau does notcomplain about the period after 15 July 2010 when the Former Solicitors declined to further act for the Plaintiff.  In fact, thePlaintiff has immediately applied for legal aid, and on granting of legal aid Pâs Solicitors issued the Writ of Summons with reasonablepromptness. Mr Lauâs criticism is reserved for the following two periods of delay even on the Plaintiffâs own case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  a period of about 6 months from 29 May 2009 (ie the date of Dr Wongâs medical examination of the Plaintiff) until about November2009 (ie when the Plaintiff contacted the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff to check on the progress of her claim against the Defendants);</p>        <p>(b)  a period of about 8 months from about November 2009 (ie when the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff assured the Plaintiff that formal legal proceedings against the Defendants would be issued shortly) and early July 2010 (iewhen the Plaintiff telephoned the 2<sup>nd</sup> Staff to enquire about the progress of her claim).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Lau argues that even though the Plaintiff has instructed the Former Solicitors to act for her, she has not offered any justifiablereason for her failure to follow up with the Former Solicitors during these two periods of delay which he says cannot be regardedas insignificant.  I will deal with these two periods in greater detail below, but suffice to state here that I find the Plaintiffhas given an explanation for the delay which I find to be largely acceptable.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(b)  Effect of any delay on the cogency of the evidence</i></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  This concerns the issue of forensic prejudice.  The evidential burden is on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to show that the evidence to be adduced by them is likely to be less cogent because of the delay.  The delay under section30(3)(b) of the Ordinance is delay since the expiry of the limitation period.  Nevertheless, the effect of <i>pre</i>-expiry delay on the cogency of the evidence can also be taken into account as one of the circumstances of the case in balancing prejudice. For convenience, I shall deal with the impact of <i>pre</i>- and <i>post</i>-expiry delay on the cogency of the evidence together.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Lau accepts that the only forensic prejudice is the âprejudice to the Defendantsâ case as the Defendantsâ memories, inparticularly the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is a 66 years old man to whom an operation with full anaesthesia had been done a few years ago, of the matter shall fadeawayâ (see the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs affirmation).  Mr Lau submits that the Plaintiffâs delay has led to deterioration of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs memory, and with no prospect of a trial in the near future his memory may deteriorate even further, which will be detrimentalto the defence against the Plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  However, it is clear that a general allegation of impairment of memory is normally insufficient. I have referred counsel to <i>Leeson v Marsden &amp; anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2008/1011.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] EWHC 1011 (QB)</a> paras. 159-163 where it was argued that following the expiry of the limitation period without a legal claim being served, the defendanthad hoped the case was over and was disappointed by legal proceedings issued against her outside the time limit.  The defendant reliedon dimming recollection and inability to give cogent evidence about the relevant events above and beyond that which would have appliedin any event if the action had been brought within time in order to resist the application to extend the time limit.  But â[there]is no witness statement from her setting out particular difficulties in this respect or the extent to which she considers she isnow prejudiced; nor is there any statement responding to the Claimantâs factual allegations, which might be expected to revealany areas of factual dispute which could not now be fairly resolved on the evidenceâ.  Further, the defendant in that case hadin fact pleaded a detailed defence giving a detailed response to each allegation.  In the absence of evidence of particular prejudice,the judge found that the cogency of her evidence was unlikely to be affected.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Here, no Defence has been filed to date by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his affirmation merely says that they deny all allegations that the Plaintiffâs injuries were caused by their mismanagement,and they further aver that the Ortho Report was solo opinion without input by any expert engaged by them.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant further claims that they cannot explain the Plaintiffâs alleged injuries except that they may be related to her historyof carcinoma of the right breast with surgical excision and axillary lymph node dissection done in August 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  To take the last point first, there is simply no medical evidence before me that supports the supposition that the dislocation ofthe Plaintiffâs right shoulder was in any way related to her previous carcinoma disease. Indeed, such allegation is contradictedby the opinion of Dr Wong (see paragraph 16 above).  In my view, since there is no serious attempt by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to outline their substantive defence to the Plaintiffâs claim whether in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs affirmation or in the <i>inter partes</i> correspondence, there is paucity of material to support any suggestion of evidential difficulty over any particular aspect that arisesfrom dimmed recollection due to the delay.  Indeed, apart from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ admission that the Plaintiff attended the Clinic for treatment between 31 March and 12 April 2007 and their generaldenial of the Plaintiffâs claim (see paragraph 28 above), it is unclear whether there is any specific factual dispute between theparties.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  There is also no information forthcoming from the 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as to whether they have kept any contemporaneous written records of the treatment received by the Plaintiff at the Clinic,but there is no suggestion that such notes/records (if any) have been lost due to the delay.  Indeed, they have not even clarifiedthat whether their recollection of the Plaintiffâs consultations at the Clinic or whether their medical notes/records (if any)and their usual practice in such circumstances will be determinative for the purpose of defending the Plaintiffâs claim. In myview, there is insufficient evidence to support the assertion of evidential difficulty.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  I bear in mind that as early as in September 2008 the Plaintiff by the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter has set out the gist of her factual allegations as to the Incident as well as the essential allegations of negligenceagainst the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  The Plaintiffâs case in the Amended Statement of Claim is not so different from what has been alleged in the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter, and Mr Lau has not suggested that the essential details of the Plaintiffâs claim were not before the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants when they received the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter and gave instructions to Dsâ Solicitors to deny the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In <i>Cain</i>, Smith LJ said at p.599 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAlthough the delay referred to in s 33(3) [the English equivalent of section 30(3) of the Ordinance] is the delay after the expiryof the primary limitation period, it will always be relevant to consider when the defendant knew that a claim was to be made againsthim and also the opportunities he has had to investigate the claim and collect evidence: see the <i>Gwentoys</i> case. If, as here, a defendant has had early notification of a claim and every possible opportunity to investigate and to collectevidence, some delay after the expiry of three years will have had no prejudicial effect.â (see also <i>Pang Kwok Lam</i> at para.109)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  This leaves the issue of whether there is forensic prejudice arising from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs allegation of impaired memory of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as a result of his operation under general anaesthesia âdone a few years agoâ.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  First, it is unclear whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had the operation before or after the Incident in March/April 2007, hence there is no cogent evidence that any impairedrecollection as a result of the operation is necessarily due to the Plaintiffâs delay.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Secondly, it is also unclear whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had the operation before or after the <i>Pre</i>-action Letter in September 2008.  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have not disabused the possibility that the operation took place after they were alerted of the Plaintiffâs claim andhad the opportunity to preserve evidence and/or record their recollections following such notification of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Thirdly, even if the operation under full anaesthesia has dimmed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs general memory, a general allegation of impairment in memory is insufficient (see paragraphs 67-70 above).</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Fourthly, the operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant plainly cannot have any effect on the memory and recollection of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  But all of the manipulations (or stretching treatment) of the Plaintiffâs right shoulder were performed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  According to the Amended Statement of Claim, âthe Plaintiff claims in respect of the medical mis-management by the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and/or the servant and/or agents and/or employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the course of their employment â¦â¦â, and it is further averred that the Plaintiffâs prolonged pain and suffering,permanent disability, difficulties and impairment âwere solely caused and/or contributed to by the negligence and/or breach ofduty on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, either in his own right and capacity and/or as vicariously liable for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs negligence and/or breach of duty, and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and/or their servants and/or agents and/or employeesâ.  It is plain from such pleading that the Plaintiff contends thatthe alleged liability of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants is both joint and several.  I am therefore of the view that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has not sufficiently shown that he suffers forensic prejudice in respect of the Plaintiffâs claim premised on avermentsas to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs own tortious conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In light of the above, I am not persuaded that the effect of any <i>pre-</i> and <i>post-</i>expiry delay on the cogency of the evidence is so significant that it is unjust for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to meet the Plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(c)  Conduct of the defendant after the cause of action arose</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>(d)  Duration of any disability of the plaintiff arising after accrual of the cause of action</i></p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  These factors are irrelevant.  It is accepted that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have not done anything to contribute to the delay.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(e)  Conduct of the plaintiff</i></p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  This factor looks at whether the Plaintiff has taken steps to bring a claim or make a complaint even if things have subsequentlygone awry.  The test is an objective one where the reasonableness of the claimantâs actions is considered.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his affirmation claims there is no sufficient or reasonable ground for issuing the Writ of Summons outside the three-yearlimitation period. He says that the Plaintiff has retained the Former Solicitors since 2007, so proper legal advice should have beenavailable to her.  He was not in a position to verify the truth of the Plaintiffâs allegations as to her communications with theFormer Solicitors, but even if they were true there is still delay on her part and she would have an alternative remedy against theFormer Solicitors. <a name="ctx1" id="ctx1"> </a>Mr Lau refers to <i>Ng Keung Lung</i> <i>v The Personal Representative and/or the Executor and/or the Administrator of the Estate of Lam Chik Suen (deceased)</i> HCPI 512/2004, DHCJ To (unreported, 25 November 2005). In that case, the court declined to extend the time limit where the plaintiffwas unable to offer any good reason for the delay and had an alternative remedy against his solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Cheng argues that the Plaintiff has taken all reasonable and prompt steps, and that she cannot be faultedfor things having subsequently gone awry.  The Plaintiff promptly approached the Former Solicitors for legal advice and for pursuingher claim against the Defendants within the first year of the Incident.  Mr Cheng further submits that the two alleged periods ofdelay should be considered in the relevant context.  The Plaintiff has stated in her affirmation that she has never been advisedby the Former Solicitors about any time limit for commencing legal proceedings against the Defendants, and she was unaware of anysuch time limit until she attended the Legal Aid Department in August 2010.  She has entrusted her claim against the Defendants tothe Former Solicitors, and there is nothing to suggest to her that the matter was not being handled properly and diligently. Oncethe Former Solicitors terminated her retainer in July 2010, she took active steps to pursue her legal rights.  Mr Cheng argues thatthe delay was caused by the Former Solicitors and not by the Plaintiff, so the balancing exercise should not be tilted against her. Mr Cheng submits that the effect of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ arguments is to visit the faults of the Former Solicitors on the Plaintiff, which is impermissible.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I shall return to the topic of incompetence and/or dilatoriness of legal advisers in greater detail below.  But it is importantnot to confuse the two separate considerations evident from Lord Diplockâs observations in <i>Thompson</i> (see paragraph 93 below), ie whether the plaintiff himself has acted promptly and reasonably and whether his lawyers have been dilatory. Although Lord Diplock did say in <i>Thompson</i> that the accrual of the limitation defence might be regarded as a windfall only where the delay in issuing proceedings was short,Smith LJ in <i>Cain</i> at pp.595-596 said it did not seem to her that the length of the delay could be, of itself, a deciding factor.  Ultimately, it waswhether the defendant had suffered any evidential or other forensic prejudice which should make the difference.  Suffice to statehere that having considered the length and reasons for the delay, the conduct of the Plaintiff as well as her alternative remedyagainst the Former Solicitors against all the circumstances, I am of the view that the balance of prejudice tilts in favour of thePlaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(f)  Diligence of the plaintiff in obtaining medical, legal or other expert advice</i></p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Mr Cheng submits that this factor is irrelevant to the present case. Mr Lau argues that the Plaintiff has been dilatory, but premisessuch argument on the Plaintiffâs <i>pre-</i> and <i>post-</i>expiry delay as discussed in paragraphs 64 and 81 above.  In the circumstances, I rely on but will not repeat here my analysis inparagraphs 64 and 83 above.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>V.  EQUITY, PREJUDICE AND ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE</i></p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  As explained above, the court has to look at the matter broadly in determining whether or not the defendant has been disadvantagedby <i>pre-</i> and <i>post-</i>expiry delay and whether or not it will be possible for the defendant to investigate allegations, and to ask whether there is a reasonableprospect of a fair trial.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The Plaintiffâs prospects of success in the present proceedings and the evidence necessary to be adduced to establish those prospectsare part of the circumstances which the court should take into account in considering the balance of hardship (see <i>Forbes v Wandsworth Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20All%20ER%20881" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 All ER 881</a>, 894-895).  Although I should not attempt to determine the merits on affidavit evidence, I bear in mind that the Plaintiff in heraffirmation has deposed to the treatment given by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and that there are treatment medical reports from public hospitals concerning her right shoulder dislocation and the OrthoReport giving expert medical opinion on liability, causation and quantum issues.  Further, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have not adduced evidence to suggest (and Mr Lau has not suggested) that the Plaintiffâs claim is unarguable or whollyunmeritorious.  In my view, whilst I am unable to say the Plaintiff has an overwhelming or cast-iron case, it cannot be said to bea weak case that does not even deserve investigation in the course of litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Rather, Mr Lau submits that given the seriousness of the Plaintiffâs allegations against the Former Solicitors, she has a cast-ironcase against them for professional negligence such that she suffers no prejudice from the effect of section 27 of the Ordinance andthe court should not disapply the time limit.  On the other hand, Mr Cheng argues that whilst the Plaintiffâs potential cause ofaction against the Former Solicitors is a relevant factor, it is not determinative and it remains within the courtâs discretionto extend the limitation period, especially when the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants suffer no forensic prejudice.  Given counselâs differing submissions, it is necessary to review the authorities on thesubject.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  There is no dispute that when considering whether to exercise its discretionary power under section 30 of the Ordinance to allowan action to proceed after the limitation period has expired, the court is entitled to take into the account the plaintiffâs ignoranceof his legal rights when considering the reasons for the delay in bringing the action, especially when he has acted promptly oncehe knew of the existence of the legal remedy and has done all that can reasonably be expected of him.  Both counsel have cited <i>Halford</i> in support of this proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  But what if the plaintiff has sought legal advice and/or has entrusted his legal representatives to pursue his claim?</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  <i>Firman v Ellis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20QB%20886" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 QB 886</a> was decided when the English statutory discretion to disapply the time limit was newly introduced.  It was held that the court inexercising such discretion should have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and the existence or non-existence of a remedyagainst the plaintiffâs solicitors was an admissible consideration.  âIt is one of âthe circumstances of the caseâ and oneof âthe reasons for the delayâ. It may tip the scale where the defendant has been substantially prejudiced by the delayâ (<i>per</i> Lord Denning MR at p.909).</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In three of the cases considered in <i>Firman</i>, the writs had been issued before the expiry of the primary limitation period.  The insurers did not dispute liability and therewere negotiations for settlement. But due to oversight of the solicitors the writs had been neither served nor renewed within a year. Applications to renew them out of time were refused although the defendants suffered no forensic prejudice. As a result of the newLimitation Act 1975 which gave a statutory discretion to disapply the limitation period, the solicitors issued new writs and soughtto override the time limits.  The English Court of Appeal allowed the new writs to proceed.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Subsequently the House of Lords in <i>Walkley v Precision Forgings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20All%20ER%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 All ER 548</a> held that if the writ was issued and not served or the claim was discontinued or struck out and the limitation period had expired,an application could not be made to disapply the limitation period in respect of a second writ issued outside the limitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  So the House of Lords in <i>Thompson</i> accepted that the actual decision in <i>Firman</i> must be regarded as having been overruled by <i>Walkley</i>, but they still agreed with what was said in <i>Firman</i> about the unfettered nature of the discretion. Lord Diplock said at p.752 (concurred in by the other Law Lords) as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ I think it is apparent that paragraphs (e) and (f) [the English equivalent to section 30(3)(e)-(f) of the Ordinance] arereferring to the conduct of the plaintiff himself, as well as that of his lawyers after he has consulted them for the first time.<i>If he has acted promptly and reasonably it is not to be counted against him, when it comes to weighing conduct, that his lawyers havebeen dilatory and allowed the primary limitation period to expire without issuing a writ.</i> Nevertheless, when weighing what prejudice the plaintiff has suffered, the fact that if no direction is made under section 2D [theEnglish equivalent of section 30 of the Ordinance] he will have a claim over against his solicitor for the full damages that he couldhave recovered against the defendant if the action had proceeded must be a highly relevant consideration.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I have referred counsel to <i>Conry v Simpson &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%203%20All%20ER%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 3 All ER 368.</a> In that case, Stephenson LJ endorsed Lord Diplockâs observations above that the existence of a good claim in negligence againsta solicitor was a highly relevant consideration when the judge had regard to all the circumstances of the case, but he recognisedthat âit is very seldom that a remedy against a solicitor can be as satisfactory as a remedy against the original tortfeasorâ(see p.374).  In that case, the first instance judge came to the view that no one could be sure whether the solicitors would be ableto meet the liability and decided that that circumstance, in conjunction with all the other circumstances, would not make it inequitablefor him to disapply the limitation period.  The English Court of Appeal held there was no ground to say the first instance judgehad fallen into error in so exercising his discretion.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  I have also drawn counselâs attention to <i>Ramsden v Lee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20All%20ER%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 All ER 204.</a> In that case, the discretion to disapply the limitation period was exercised despite a strong claim against the plaintiffâs solicitors. The English Court of Appeal refused to lay down a guideline that in the absence of fault on the part of the defendant the limitationperiod ought to be enforced against the plaintiff unless the delay has been minimal especially if the plaintiff had a good claimagainst his solicitors for failure to issue the writ in time.  Furthermore, it was held that although the fact that the plaintiffhad a claim against his solicitors was highly relevant, to discount entirely the fact that the plaintiff would suffer some prejudicein pursuing that claim would be contrary to the requirement that the court should have regard to all the circumstances in exercisingits discretion whether to disapply the limitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In <i>Hartley</i>, Parker in applying <i>Ellis</i>, <i>Thompson</i> and <i>Donovan v Gwentoys</i> Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20All%20ER%201018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 All ER 1018</a> said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ if there was a short delay, which was in no way due to the plaintiff, but to a slip on the part of her solicitors whichdid not effect in the smallest degree the ability of the defendant to defend the case because there had been early notification ofthe claim, the exercise of the discretion in favour of the plaintiff would be justified even if the plaintiff, if not allowed toproceed, would have a cast-iron action against her solicitorsâ (p.223)</p>        <p class="quote">âFinally, I would add to the items of prejudice which a plaintiff will suffer even if he has a cast-iron claim against his solicitorsand which were indicated by both Lord Diplock and Ormrod LJ, the fact that, if the plaintiff has to change from an action againsta tortfeasor, who may know little or nothing of the weak points of his case, to an action against his solicitor, who will know agreat deal about them, the prejudice may well be major rather than minor.â (p.224)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Again, Parker LJ did not consider it useful or desirable to lay down guidelines on the basis that the circumstances would be infinitelyvariable.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Next, I have referred the parties to <i>Das v Ganju</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20PIQR%20P260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] PIQR P260.</a>  In that case Sir Christopher Staughton held that the plaintiff was blameless and the main reason for the delay was the misleadingadvice given by counsel and solicitors.  Whether negligent or not, the advice was unnecessarily discouraging in one respect, whileencouraging another course which was the wrong one to pursue.  On the issue of whether the plaintiff was to be criticised for thefault of their lawyers, after citing <i>Whitfield v North Durham Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%206%20Med%20LR%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 6 Med LR 32</a>, the learned judge at p.P268 said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â if that passage means that as a matter of law anything done by the lawyers must be visited on the client, it cannot in my viewbe reconciled with other authority.

Lord Bingham at p.P511 referred to <i>Hartley</i> with approval and said that ââ¦â¦ even if the plaintiff had a cast-iron claim against her solicitors the limitation defence couldfairly be regarded as a windfall or gratuitous bonus â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Lord Hoffmann at p.P514 cited <i>Thompson</i> and added that â[no] matter how negligent the claimantâs solicitors may have been in the simple skills of keeping a diary, theplea of limitation which the statute confers upon the defendant is, in the absence of forensic prejudice, described as a windfallof which he can properly be deprivedâ.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Lord Carswell at p.P517 said of the cases of <i>Das</i> and <i>Corbin</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn <i>Das v Ganju</i> [1999] Lloydâs Rep. Med. 198 at 204 and <i>Corbin v Penfold Metallising Co. Ltd</i> [2000] Lloydâs Rep. Med. 247 at 251 the Court of Appeal expressed the view that there was no rule that the claimant must sufferfor his solicitorâs fault. If this is interpreted, as it was in Corbin, as meaning that court is not entitled to take into accountagainst the party the failings of his solicitors who let the action go out of time, that could not in my view be sustained and thecriticism voiced in the notes to the reports of Das and Corbin would be justified. The claimant must bear responsibility, as againstthe defendant, for delays which have occurred, whether caused by his own default or that of his solicitors, and in numerous casesthat has been accepted: see, eg, <i>Firman v Ellis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20QB%20886" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] Q.B. 886</a>; <i>Thompson v Brown</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20744" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 744</a> and <i>Donovan v Gwentoys Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20WLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 W.L.R. 472.</a> The reason was articulated by Ward LJ in <i>Hytec Information Systems Ltd v Coventry City Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 W.L.R. 1666</a>, a case of striking out, when he said, at 1675:</p>        <p class="quote">âOrdinarily this court should not distinguish between the litigant himself and his advisers. There are good reasons why the courtshould not: first, if anyone is to suffer for the failure of the solicitor it is better be the client than another party to the litigation;secondly, the disgruntled client may in appropriate cases have his remedies in damages or in respect of the wasted costs; thirdly,it seems to me that it would become a charter for the incompetent (as Mr McGregor eloquently put it) were this court to allow almostimpossible investigations in apportioning blame between solicitor and counsel on the one hand, or between themselves and their clienton the other.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  At first blush, Lord Carswellâs view appears to be apparently inconsistent with the long line of authorities discussed above,but he went on to clarify at p.P517 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat said, whereas the claimant will suffer obvious prejudice if the limitation period is not disapplied, this may be reduced byhis having a cause of action in negligence against his solicitors. The extent of that reduction will vary according to the circumstances,but even if he has an apparently cast-iron case against the solicitors the factors referred to by Lord Diplock in Thompson v Brownat 750 require to be borne in mind.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  In <i>Leeson</i>, Cox J rejected the bold submission that <i>Das</i>, <i>Corbin</i> and <i>Steeds</i> were decided <i>per incuriam</i>.  The learned judge noted that the origin of these three cases was Lord Diplockâs observations in <i>Thompson</i>, which were not dissented from in <i>Horton</i>.  Further, the House of Lords did not disapprove those three cases all of which were referred to in argument before them.  It washeld that as the authorities then stood, <i>Das</i>, <i>Corbin</i> and <i>Steeds</i> were binding, so in <i>Leeson</i> the default of the solicitors was not to be attributed to the claimant when considering the weight to be attached to the reasonsfor the delay and its duration, and when weighing the conduct of the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  In <i>Cain</i>, Smith LJ said at pp.598-599 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[72] A claimantâs position is different. He has a substantive right, his cause of action, but he cannot proceed with it becauseof the operation of s 11 [the English equivalent of section 27 of the Ordinance]. He has therefore been prejudiced by the loss ofthe right to enforce his cause of action. That prejudice is greatly reduced if he has a good claim over against his solicitor. Ina case where the defendant has suffered some forensic or procedural prejudice, which will diminish his ability to defend himself,it will be relevant to consider that the claimant has another remedy. But the fact that the claimant has a claim over will not necessarilymean that the discretion should be refused. It might still be fair and just that the defendant remains in the frame. It is the defendantwho has, ex hypothesi, committed the tort and, as Lord Denning MR pointed out, it is his insurer who has received the premiums inrespect of the relevant risk. So the fact that the claimant will not suffer financially in the end is relevant but not determinative.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Mr Lau submits (and I agree) that each case turns on its own facts, but it does not mean that the above principles on the approachto the exercise of discretion under section 30 of the Ordinance should be ignored.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  There is no question that upon advice by the Former Solicitors and Counsel the Plaintiff was early aware of her right, and she hasformed the intention to sue the Defendants and has instructed the Former Solicitors to that end well within the limitation period. However, owing to various circumstances arguably of incompetence or dilatoriness on the part of the Former Solicitors, the presentproceedings were issued about half a year out of time.  The length of such delay is comparatively modest.  But I accept that each<i>pre-</i> and <i>post-</i>expiry period of delay needs separate consideration as to whether it is excusable.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Mr Lau directs his complaint to two periods of delay between 29 May 2009 and about November 2009 (about 6 months) and between aboutNovember 2009 and early July 2010 (about 8 months) in which, he submits, the Plaintiff has not taken any steps to follow up withthe Former Solicitors on the progress of her claim against the Defendants.  But such periods of delay must be considered in the contextof the Plaintiff being unaware of any limitation period for issuing her claim against the Defendants, and that she had entrustedthe Former Solicitors to prepare her claim.  Although the Plaintiff has been let down by the Former Solicitors, she was not alertedto any need for urgency to follow up with the Former Solicitors, and to adopt the words of His Honour Judge Charles Harris QC whowas the first instance judge in <i>Burke v Ashe Construction Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/717.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] EWCA Civ 717</a>, she is ânot the sort of [person] who can be expected to chivvy or invigilate [her] own lawyersâ.  Further, the Ortho Reportwas only compiled on 24 July 2009, so prior to that date the Plaintiff did not as yet have any expert medical basis to confirm hersuspicion that the dislocation of her right shoulder was caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ medical mismanagement. So in any event, there can be no legitimate complaint of inexcusable delay prior to 24 July2009. In my view, the delay over the two periods identified by Mr Lau is not so inexcusable to result in a refusal to extend thelimitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Mr Lau next argues that the existence of the Plaintiffâs cast-iron claim against the Former Solicitors must ameliorate any prejudiceas flows from the impact of the limitation period, and the balance of prejudice should therefore tilt against any discretionary extensionof the limitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In my view, the extent that the obvious prejudice to the Plaintiff if the limitation period is not disapplied may be reduced byher having a cause of action against the Former Solicitors again must be considered in context. Even if she has a strong cause ofaction against the Former Solicitors, it is a loss of a chance claim.  As explained in <i>Conry</i> and <i>Hartley</i>, such claim is seldom as satisfactory a remedy as a claim against the original tortfeasor who may know little or nothing about theweak points of the Plaintiffâs case as compared with the Former Solicitors who may know a great deal about them.  Further, as explainedin <i>Das</i>, to establish her claim against the Former Solicitors and to recover full damages so that any prejudice will be ameliorated, thePlaintiff will have to prove the merits of her action against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants (and in this respect I note they have indicated they will vigorously defend the Plaintiffâs claim) and to prove thatthe Former Solicitors have been negligent and/or in breach of express or implied terms of the retainer.  It cannot be said the Plaintiffwill suffer no prejudice at all if the time limit is not extended.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In the circumstances, whilst I accept that the Plaintiffâs potential claim against the Former Solicitors is a highly relevantconsideration, it should not be ignored that she has acted with reasonable and sufficient promptness in complying with the FormerSolicitorsâ advice to attend the Conference with Counsel, in paying costs on account, in signing documents for obtaining medicalreports from the treatment hospitals, in attending the medical examination by Dr Wong and in attending meetings with the Former Solicitors. In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the Former Solicitorsâ default in failing to issue the claim against the Defendantswithin time should be visited on the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  More importantly, there has been early notification of the Plaintiffâs claim to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, who are unable to identify a real risk of forensic prejudice to either or both of them in answering the Plaintiffâsclaim.  Given that actual forensic prejudice is slight and it is still possible for a respectably fair trial to take place, I ampersuaded that the limitation defence can fairly be regarded as a windfall of which the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants can properly be deprived.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In all the circumstances, I am of the view that I should disapply <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VI.

Mr Cheng points out that Pâs solicitors have set out the gist of the Plaintiffâs explanation for the delayin their letter dated 30 October 2010 (see paragraph 44 above).  But given the admitted delay, I do not find it unreasonable forthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to test the Plaintiffâs assertions which were not made on affirmation at that time.  However, it is unreasonable forthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to continue to resist the application after the Plaintiff filed and served her affirmation and the fullness of her groundsfor resisting the Summons is evident.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  So even though the Plaintiff has eventually succeeded in extending the time limit, she should pay to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants costs of the Summons up to the filing and service of her affirmation (including all costs reserved if any), and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants shall pay to the Plaintiff the costs of the Summons thereafter (including the costs of the hearing before me).  Therewill be certificate for counsel and legal aid taxation for the Plaintiffâs own costs. The above order for costs will be an order<em>nisi</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  Since the Plaintiff is legally aided, summary assessment of costs is inappropriate in light of Order 62 rule 9C(1)(b) of the Rulesof the High Court unless Pâs Solicitors waives the right to any further sum of money in respect of the costs of the application. Pâs Solicitors are directed to write to my clerk with copy to Dsâ Solicitors within 14 days from today to confirm whether theyare willing to waive the right to any further sum of money in respect of the above costs order <i>nisi</i> in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  If Pâs Solicitors are unwilling to waive such right, the above costs whether in favour of the Plaintiff and/or the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants shall be taxed (in any event) if not agreed.
