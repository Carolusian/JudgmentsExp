The Temple is open to the publicand the Plaintiff (hereinafter called âPâ) used to frequent the Temple.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> It is Pâs case that she came to know D at the Temple in August 1992 and D became her master in Buddhism.  Between end of 1992 andend of 2001, P lent a total sum of $489,500 to D at the latterâs requests and on terms.  On 19<sup>th</sup> April 1996, the property known as Block D (No.42 Shung Ling Street, 5<sup>th</sup> Floor and Roof, Nos.40 and 42 Shung Ling Street, Kowloon (hereinafter called âthe Propertyâ) was purchased, partly paid for bypart of Pâs loans.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By this action, P is claiming against D for:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) a declaration that D holds the Property on trust for D and P who has an equitable interest thereof;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) a declaration that D shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the Property without prior written consent of P; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) the repayment of the alleged loans in the total sum of $489,500.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Although initially P has also claimed for damages to be assessed as an alternative to her claim for the above declarations.

Voluntary donations were made from time to time by members of the Group and others for the purpose of acquiringa place of worship and, thereafter, its running expenses.  This has cumulated in the purchase of the Property in 1996.

It is Dâs case that P has made voluntary donations of $130,000 to $135,000 in about1994 towards the eventual purchase of the Property and $150,000 in about 1996 towards decoration of the Property.

It was a condition of the said loan that it would <i>be repaid on demand as soon as you or [the Society] or the</i> <i>ä»å§ä½å </i> <i>had sufficient money</i>.  It was the common intention that the said loan was to <i>be secured by the Property and/or other assets of [D] and the said</i> <i>ä»å§ä½å </i>, which will be sold to repay the said loan if necessary.  At the same time, [P] had been granted an <i>irrevocable right to reside at a room on the rooftop of the Property for life</i>.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Dâs counsel has helpfully analyzed in his written closing submission how the above allegations differ from Pâs pleaded case andher evidence in court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> First, the allegation that the Society is also a borrower and bears the responsibility to repay the loans is dropped.  It is nowPâs case that D and D alone was the borrower.  P even went so far as to deny any knowledge of the existence of the Society in paragraph3 of her Reply and Defence to Counterclaim!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Secondly, the alleged condition that the loans would be repaid on demand <u>as soon as</u> D or the Society had sufficient money is changed to the condition that the loans would be repaid on demand <u>or</u> as soon as D has sufficient money to repay whichever is the earlier.  Based on the first formulation, demand for repayment will onlybe made when there is sufficient money.  However, according to the second formulation, the loans will have to be repaid upon demandwhether or not there is sufficient money to repay!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Thirdly, the allegation that the loans are secured by the Property and/or Dâs assets is dropped altogether in Pâs pleadings andtestimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Fourthly, the purpose(s) for which the alleged loans were made is changed from purchase of the Property and its daily operation expensesto:</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="7%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>			<td width="88%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$130,000 and 			$57,000 for the purchase of the Property;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="7%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>			<td width="88%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$150,000 for 			the decoration of the Property;</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="7%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>			<td width="88%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$30,000 for 			further decoration and furniture expenses of the Property; and</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="7%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>			<td width="88%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">$122,500 for 			purchase of the flat next door to the Property.</td>			</tr>		</table>	</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Fifthly, the interest in the Property acquired by P by reason of the loans is changed from residing at a room on the rooftop of theProperty to residing in the Property!  It is common ground that the âroom on the rooftop of the Propertyâ has been demolishedpursuant to order(s) of the Building Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The said letter was drafted by Pâs former legal adviser.  Copy of it has been sent to a legislative counselor, the licensing officeof the Hong Kong Police and the Inland Revenue Department for the obvious purpose of hoping to initiate some form of investigationagainst D.  In those circumstances, it is only reasonable to assume that P must have obtained legal advice on her case and takencare in setting out her allegations fully and correctly in the said letter for the relevant authorities to follow up and in ordernot to mislead the authorities.  Be that as it may, it is most remarkable that Pâs case can change so drastically in a matter ofmonths between the said letter in August 2003 and the writ issued in March 2004!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> In fact, there is yet another turn in Pâs case when she testifies in court.  She initially stood by her pleaded case that she would<u>both</u> be entitled to full repayment of the loans <u>and</u> to reside at the Property for life.  When she was cross-examined as to why she would still be entitled to stay on at the Propertyif the loans had been repaid, she changed her story yet again and alleges that the agreement was in fact she is not entitled to stayon at the Property upon full repayment of the loans!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> All these twists and turns tend to cast doubt on Pâs case.  This is all the more so as Pâs case is mainly based on oral evidence. There is nothing to evidence the alleged loans and the alleged terms.  If she cannot be consistent with herself, how can she expectothers to believe her?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(B)  The amounts allegedly lent</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It is Pâs testimony in court that she lent money to P as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) $130,000 in 1 lump sum in about end of 1992 for purchase of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) $57,000 by various sums ranging from $500 to $7,000 between end of 1992 to mid-1996 for purchase of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) $150,000 in 1 lump sum on 21<sup>st</sup> May 1996 for decoration of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) $30,000 in 1 lump sum in end of May 1996 for further decoration and furniture of the Property; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e) $122,500 by various sums ranging from $5,000 to $13,000 between mid-1996 and end of 2001 for purchase of the flat next to theProperty.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Let me now examine each of these alleged loans more closely.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(B1)  The alleged loans of $130,000 and the $57,000 for purchase of the Property</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The first alleged loan of $130,000 was dated end of 1992.  According to P, D had asked her to lend as much as possible (âç¡åâ)for purchase of a premises for worshipping purposes.  At that time, P had about $600,000 to $700,000 savings.  She trusted D andso she lent her $130,000 with the intention of making further monthly contributions thereafter as well as saving some money for herown use.  Between end of 1992 to mid-1996, P periodically lent varying amounts of money to D totaling $57,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> To start with, Pâs alleged loans of $130,000 and $57,000 are not evidenced by any documentary evidence.  Although at one stagein Pâs testimony, she seemed to suggest that there might be some form of record for these loans, she eventually agrees that thereis no written record and that she just memorized the amounts by heart.  Although, according to P, the loans were made in monthlyintervals, the amount of each loan varies and ranged from $500 to $7,000.  P apparently has difficulty in recounting in court howshe has lent a total of $57,000 to D between end of 1992 to mid-1996 â a period of over 3 years! </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Secondly, it is Pâs case that she had only met D on 12<sup>th</sup> August 1992.  So the first alleged loan of $130,000 was apparently made less than 4 months after P had met D.  Why was P willingto part with such a significant sum of money?  When P was cross-examined on this subject, she agrees that her elder sister Lai Wong-tai(é»æºå¼) (hereinafter called âLAIâ) had in fact contributed (âå¤¾â) $100,000 odd for the purchase of a premises for worshippingpurposes and she wanted to match the amount.  LEE and AU have likewise contributed (âå¤¾â) money for that purpose.  P claimsthat she does not know whether the money âcontributedâ by LAI, LEE and AU were by way of loans or donations but she confirmsthat she has not heard of them demanding for repayment.  This aspect of Pâs testimony, read together with her evidence concerningthe burning of the list of donors during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Property as a place of worship (dealt with below),tends to suggest that the $130,000 was given to D by way of donation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(B2)  The alleged loans of $150,000 and $30,000 for the decoration of the Property and/or furniture</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> It is Pâs case that D has asked for the alleged loans of $150,000 and $30,000 for decoration of the Property and/or furniture.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Pâs case must be viewed against the background that LO has underwritten all the expenses for decoration of the Property and/orfurniture.  LOâs generosity is confirmed by his donations towards the purchase price of the Property, his further paying the 10%deposit for the purchase, his paying for the stamp duty, legal fees and estate agents charges to facilitate the purchase.  All theseâdonationsâ from LO have not been challenged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The fact that LO has offered to pay for the decoration of the Property has not been successfully challenged.  It is LOâs testimonythat he had initially refused to accept the $150,000 from P as he had already underwritten such expenses.  Upon Pâs insistence,LO accepted $150,000 not in the nature of loan but as Pâs donation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Pâs testimony on the circumstances of the alleged loan of $30,000 for further decoration and furniture is also suspicious.  Accordingto P, D had told her that there was no money left after purchase of the Property and hence a loan was required for further decorationof the Property and furniture.  P eventually made the loan on 21<sup>st</sup> May 1996.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> However, P herself was apparently one of the account holders of the bank account for the Group at that time.  The fact that P wasone of the account holders of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited savings account no.174-6-015914 is evidencedby the bank statements produced (at Agreed Bundle pp.194-195).  It can be noted that a sum of $1,017,000 was withdrawn from thisaccount on 19<sup>th</sup> April 1996 apparently for the purchase of the Property.  The balance after such withdrawal was $77,454.39.  In fact the balance ofthat account did not fall below that figure until the account was closed in February 1997.  It would be most risky for D to lie aboutthe account balance since P (as one of the account holders) would be in a position to ascertain the actual balance from the bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In fact, Pâs own testimony has also suggested that she might have contributed the sums of $130,000 and $150,000 in relation tothe Property by way of donations (as opposed to loans).  According to P, there was a ceremony marking the opening of the Propertyas a place of worship on 31<sup>st</sup> August 1996.  At one stage of the ceremony and in front of all the people present including guests, a list of donors with the amountdonated respectively was recited and then the list burnt as a gesture of offering the donations to the deities.  P has confirmedunder cross-examination that her name was indeed included in the list of donors recited and the amount attributed to her was $280,000. When she was asked why she did not object to it as she had meant the $280,000 to be loans, she could not give a satisfactory answer!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(B3)  The alleged loan of $122,500 for purchase of the flat next door to the Property</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I also find that the alleged circumstances of the making of the loan of $122,500 to be suspicious.  According to P, D mentioned toher sometime between July and September 1996 that the Property was too small and needed an extension.  D asked P to lend as muchas possible (âç¡åâ) for the purchase of the next door flat.  The first sum of $5,000 was lent in August 1996, followed byloans of money ranging from $5,000 to $13,000 to end of 2001, totaling $122,500.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> There is no record of the money lent over the alleged period of 4-5 years and P, again, has difficulty recounting the timing andthe amounts lent in court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> P even says in her evidence that she had been asked by D to approach the owner of the next door flat to enquire about the possibilityof acquiring her premises.  However, the owner of the next door has flatly rejected the idea.  Under these circumstances, it is quiteamazing that P would still continue to lend to D for 4-5 years for that failed purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> What is even more amazing is that D would have lent these loans upon the same alleged terms as the previous âloansâ.  Assumingthat D had already promised that P could reside at the Property for life, P should have realized by then that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) She was only allowed to live in a corrugated-iron structure on the roof instead of on 5/F of the Property where the worshippinghall is situated.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) The use of the Property, including the moving in of P, was at the whim of D.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) D had apparently allowed other elderly members, such as Ko Pik-shan, to move in to the structure on the roof without consultingP.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) Keys to the Property were apparently made available to all members of the Group.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I find it quite unbelievable that P would continue to make these loans to D over the extended period when:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) there was no hope of purchasing the next door premises, which is the only purpose of such loans; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) D had already failed to honour her promise by giving P an irrevocable life interest in the Property in the way contemplated byP.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Perhaps, upon realizing the unreasonableness of the above circumstances, P suggests during cross-examination that D had further promisedto give her a room as an additional condition for the $122,500 loans.  However, this last twist in her testimony is neither pleadednor mentioned in her witness statement filed herein!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(C)  The alleged terms of the loans</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> It is Pâs case that the loans totaling $489,500 were all made upon the same terms, namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) D would repay all money lent by P on demand or as soon as D has sufficient money to repay whichever is the earlier; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) P would have an irrevocable life interest in the flat to be purchased (i.e. P could reside there at for her whole life).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The inherent weakness of the first alleged term is quite obvious.  The alleged basis for Pâs loans was that D herself did not havethe financial resources to acquire a worshipping hall.  If this alleged purpose is fulfilled and the worshiping hall is purchased,D would then unlikely to be able to repay P!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I also have much doubt about the second alleged term.  Pâs testimony, quoting from her witness statement (at Agreed Bundle p.2)which P has adopted, is that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âè¢«åäººç­ææ¬äººå¥¹æé¢å¾å¯ç²åéï¼èä¸ âæä½å ä¸æ¥ï¼ä¾¿ææä¸æ¥â åç­æçµ¦æ¬äººâçé¤æ­»è¬âï¼å³ä½¿æ¬äººç¾å¹´æ­¸èäº¦ä¸ç¨éç¥å®¶äººï¼è¢«åäººææ¿æ¬äººå®æãéä¾¿æ¯æ¬äººåé¢çµ¦è¢«åäººçåå ãè¢«åäººäº¦åæ¬äººç­æï¼ç­å¥¹è²·äºå±ä¹å¾ï¼å¾å¥¹æé¢å°±æåæ¬äººæ­¸éææåæ¬¾ï¼åæå¨æ¬äººå¨ç¶æ¿ä¸æéè¦çæåï¼å¯åä»æåºè¦æ±æ­¸éåæ¬¾ãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">It is quite difficult to discern from the above statement how an âirrevocable life interestâ in the flat to be purchased is grantedby D to P.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> According to P, there had been no further discussion whatsoever concerning the relationship between Pâs loans and the flat to bepurchased.  P has admittedly no idea as to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) What was the size of the flat to be purchased?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) What was the target price for the purchase?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) What was the target amount of Pâs loan?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) How much of the purchase price would be met by Pâs loan?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e) What would be the extent of Pâs âlife interestâ in the flat to be purchased?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f) Whether there would be other âlender(s)â?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g) What is relationship between the âlife interestâ of P and that of other âlender(s)â (if any)?</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The extent of Pâs alleged irrevocable life interest in the flat to be purchased was anything but certain and defined.  In the circumstances,what exactly was the agreement in terms of the scope or extent of Pâs âirrevocable life interestâ in the Property?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Lastly, it must be remembered that P is claiming <u>both</u> repayment of the loans <u>and</u> a right to reside at the Property for life in this action.  Why should P still be entitled to reside at the Property upon full repaymentof the loans?  When P is confronted with this question during cross-examination, she alleges <u>for the first time</u> that the agreement in fact was that she would no longer be entitled to stay there upon full repayment of the loans!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(D)  The alleged underlying reason for the loans</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> P intends to explain away all the above weaknesses in her case by alleging a master and disciple relationship between D and P andthat she would do whatever the master directs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Both P and CHIU confess in their testimony that D is in fact a living deity by the name of âæµ®é²é¶´ä¸å°â.  D has given themthe name of âè¦ºåæ ¹â and âåç¥çâ respectively when D became their master.  Over the years, D has taught them âå¿æ³âand âææ³â or even âå¦æ³â and it has even been pleaded that D could perform miracles in the eyes of P!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I find the testimony of P and CHIU concerning their relationship with D not up to scrutiny.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> First, they say that D had in the past led the Group in public worship at the Temple.  D would stand distinctly in front of the Groupand led them to chant in public.  This aspect of their evidence is inconsistent with their claim that D had, at the same time, askedthem to be discreet about Dâs identity.  D has allegedly forbidden them to call her master in front of others.  I also agree withDâs counsel that the fact that D has taken such an outstanding role in public worship is inconsistent with the Dâs work as anemployee of TWGH.  It is common ground that D was at that time an employee of TWGH and had her own daily duties at the Temple toperform which did not include leading worships.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Secondly, both P and D allege in court to have undergone some sort of initiation ceremony to become a disciple of D.  However, theyhave both omitted to mention these ceremonies in their witness statements filed herein.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Thirdly, if D could really work miracle and that D has taught them âå¿æ³â and âææ³â, I find it very strange that neitherP nor CHIU can recite any âå¿æ³â or demonstrate any âææ³â when they testify in court.  This is particularly so as theyhave apparently been practicing those âå¿æ³â and âææ³â many times daily for many years previously!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Fourthly, it is common ground that P did ask D to go on a retreat (éé).  It is rather strange for a disciple to ask his/her masterto do that.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Lastly, CHIU alleges in her testimony that she has celebrated for D in the past the birthday of the living deity âæµ®é²é¶´ä¸å°â. She said that the disciples would even buy birthday cake for the occasion.  Strangely enough, she cannot now remember what the birthdaydate is!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The evidence, on the whole, does suggest that every one involved in this case have quite some respect for D at one time or another. In my view, that is quite understandable given the looseness they organized their affairs, such as the pooling of money to purchasethe Property in the past and the running the worshipping hall at the Property at present.  They need someone to take on a more leadingrole.  In fact, the same can be said of LAI (who held the public purse, so to speak) and LO (who became the chairman of the Society). In my view, the respect D (and CHIU) bestowed on D in the past does not provide adequate justification for the inconsistencies inPâs case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(E)  Two essential elements of Pâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In my view, Pâs case can be looked at from another perspective.  In order for P to succeed, she must establish that:</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>				<td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the loans 				were indeed made to D; and</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>				<td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 				Property was beneficially owned by D.</td>			</tr>		</table>	</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(E1)  Whether the loans were indeed made to D?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> It is Pâs case that the $130,000 and the $57,000 she âlentâ to D have been used to purchase the Property.  P does not disputethe fact that a significant portion of the purchase money came from the bank account no.174-6-015914 then jointly held by D, LAIand Lam Chew-yang (ææé½) (see Bundle B194).  So P is, in effect, saying that the money in that bank account belonged to D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The money in bank account no.174-6-015914 was in fact transferred from bank account no.174-9-014633 held jointly by LAI, Lam Chew-yang,Leung Yum-ting (æ¢æ¬½åº­).  This account was closed on 10<sup>th</sup> February 1995 and the balance transferred to bank account no.174-6-015914.  Bank account no.174-6-015914 was closed on 25<sup>th</sup> February 1997 and the balance transferred to bank account no.009-2-121797 held by LAI, Lam Chew-yang and CHIU jointly.  Subsequently,bank account no.009-2-121797 was also closed and the balance transferred to bank account no.009-9-131674 held by LAI and CHIU jointlyand the account is still in existence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Indeed it was put to D during cross-examination that D was/is the beneficiary of all the money deposited in the above bank accountsas well as the other fixed deposits and savings accounts and that the various account holders were/are holding the respective accounton trust for D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> LAI has all along remained an account holder of the above bank accounts.  There is a statutory declaration from LAI (at Bundle B88-94)confirming that the money in the above accounts were all in the nature of donations and now belong to the Society.  P does not opposethe said statutory declaration to be admitted as evidence.  In fact, P has not seriously challenged its contents either.  Indeed,LAI must be a key witness in this case from the point of view of Pâs case.  She has until recently been responsible for financialaffairs such as receiving contributions from others for various purposes.  According to P, LAI may even be a witness to some of theâloansâ made by P to D.  LAI is the elder sister of P.  Yet, LAI is not called to testify in court.  P cannot give any satisfactoryexplanation as to why LAI is not called.  Having regard to all the circumstances of this case, including those considerations listedin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, I am satisfied that I should place full weight to the content of the said statutory declaration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> CHIU is currently the other account holder for bank account no.009-9-131674.  However, she has not been consistent in her evidenceconcerning the nature of the money held in the above accounts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> In her witness statement filed herein on 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2004, she alleged that the money belonged to D (see Bundle A9, para.4).  In court, she says that the money consist of contributions(âå¤¾é¢â) from others including herself for the purchase of the next door flat as well as donations for âé¦æ²¹é¢â andâæ­éç¥åé¢â.  However, back in August 2003, she asserted in her letter to the Societies Officer (at Bundle B86) that themoney in the bank account(s) jointly held be her and others included Pâs private old-age pension (âç§äººé¤èéâ)!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Furthermore, the Society has apparently asserted ownership to the money in the above accounts in April 2003 and requested CHIU totransfer them to the Societyâs bank account (see Bundle B74-75).  This was met with a most evasive reply from CHIU through hersolicitors refusing the request (see Bundle B76-77).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> By reason of the above inconsistencies, one does not even begin to understand what CHIUâs evidence is on the nature of the moneyin the above bank accounts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> On the other hand, it is Dâs case that the money put in various bank accounts over the years was donation and belongs to the Groupand/or the Society. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Dâs case is apparently supported by the statutory declarations of LAI, AU (at Bundle B95-100) and LEE (at Bundle B101-106).  Ihave decided to attach full weight to LAIâs statutory declaration.  AU and LEE have confirmed the truthfulness of their respectivestatutory declaration in court and D has not succeeded, in my view, in discrediting them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> In any event, I also agree with the Defendantâs counselâs submission that the way the money was held in the bank accounts overthe years is more consistent with a group of people put together some money and have the money put in bank accounts held jointlyby people they consider to be trust-worthy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> All in all, I am not satisfied with the evidence before me that the money held in any of the bank account at any time belong to Dbeneficially.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Given my above finding, it is unlikely that D would have asked for personal loans from P and then put the loans into bank accountsnot beneficially owned by her and apparently not for her own use or purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(E2)  Whether the Property was beneficially owned by D?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Another essential element of Pâs case must be that the Property belongs to D beneficially.  If the Property does not belong toD, then:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) It would be unlikely that D would request the alleged loans from P; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) D would not be in a position to grant any âirrevocable life interestâ to P.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> P has not challenged the fact that the money for the purchase of the Property came from bank account no.174-6-015914 and LO.  Givenmy above finding that the money then deposited in bank account no.174-6-015914 did not belong to D, it is unlikely that the Propertymainly purchased with such money would belong to D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> In fact there is other evidence pointing to the fact that D does not beneficially own the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> It is common ground that when the Property was purchased in 1996, it was initially held in the joint names of D and Lo Chi-wai. Lo Chi-wai is the son of LAI.  It is the evidence of D that the decision for D and Lo Chi-wai to jointly hold the Property was madeafter a ceremony to consult a deity.  If D really beneficially owns the Property, there was no reason why D should ask Lo Chi-waito hold half of her interest for her.  Lo Chi-wai is the son of Dâs sister.  If there was any special reason why Lo Chi-wai shouldhold half of the Property for D, it is likely that P would know.  Furthermore, the legal costs for the purchase as well as a substantialpart of the cost of decoration (i.e. other than the $150,000 from P) were apparently donated by LO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> It is common ground that Lo Chi-wai had wanted to withdraw from being an owner of the Property in 2001.  More importantly, thereis also evidence that the Society did take legal advice at about that time on having the Property transferred to the Society (seeBundle B33).  According to LO, the plan to transfer the Property to the Society was not adopted for legal and practical reasons (seeBundle A41, para.16).  Eventually, Lo Chi-wai transferred his half share of the Property to D for the consideration of $1 (see BundleB35-44).  The legal expenses for the transfer was billed to the Society (see Bundle B45) and paid for by LO. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> There is then the evidence that the operating expenses for the Property (such as electricity, telephone and water bills) as wellas rates were met by money deposited in bank accounts jointly held by members of the Group/Society (see Bundle B199-206).  It isalso the unchallenged evidence of LO that he had paid for the demolition of the illegal structure at the Property in 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Lastly, there is also the evidence that many members of the Group/Society has key to the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> In my view, all the above evidence are more consistent with D not being the beneficial owner of the Property but merely holding theProperty for others.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(F)  Whether Pâs conduct is consistent with Pâs case?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Pâs case may also be tested against her own conduct at the material time.  P is very particular about the fact that she has beenpromised an irrevocable life interest in the Property, in the sense that she may reside there for the whole of her life.  This muchis clear from Pâs testimony quoted above.  Yet, her conduct after the acquisition of the Property is not consistent with such contention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> If she had a life interest in the Property, one would expect her to stay on the 5/F premises of the Property.  However, she had onlystayed at an illegal corrugated iron structure on the roof premises of the Property.  Whatâs more, D had apparently allowed othermembers of the Group/Society (namely, Ko Pik-shan and LAI) to move into the roof premises without consulting P!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> It is Pâs own evidence that D had in the past even forbidden her from entering 5/F premises of the Property where the worshippinghall is situated.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> What is most telling is the incident in end of 2002 when D allegedly instructed (âå©åâ) P to move out of the roof premises. That happened after the relationship between P and D had broken down in 2001 (see Bundle A4, para.12) and the alleged refusal ofD to ârepayâ $500,000 to P in September 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> P was apparently very furious and dictated several letters to CHIU for D (see Bundle B64-65).  However, P mentioned nothing abouther âirrevocable life interestâ in these letters!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> In the circumstances, it is rather unlikely that P had been promised an âirrevocable life interestâ from the start as allegedby her.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Other considerations regarding Pâs claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Much has been said by P regarding Dâs alleged promise to ârepayâ P $500,000 in 2002.  The evidence does suggest to me thatthe âhold-upâ of the payment (so to speak) was due to CHIU.  In any event, given the earlier incident of attempted ârepaymentâof $100,000 to Ko Pik-shan by the Group/Society when there is no evidence of any loan from Chi-wai in the first place and the subsequentdonation of that sum of $100,000 to charity when Ko Pik-shan and her son refused to accept it, I am not persuaded that the offerto ârepayâ P $500,000 is evidence of any loans from P to D previously.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> There is then the incident in end of 2002 when P was asked to vacate the roof of the Property.  On the evidence, I am satisfied thatthe timing of the incident was consistent with the order of the Building Authority to demolish the illegal structure at the Property. In my view, this incident does not advance Pâs case at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Pâs counsel has suggested in his written closing submission that much of the inconsistencies in Pâs case can be explained bythe fact that we are dealing with elderly people in this case.  Notwithstanding her age, P appears to be healthy, alert, clear andlucid when she testifies in court.  She is able to comprehend and answer the questions put to her by counsel during examination. I cannot detect any signs of frailty in P let alone any lack of reasoning power.  Given her performance in court, there is simplyno basis for me to doubt her physical and mental fitness in the past.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Conclusion on Pâs claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> For the above reasons, I have serious doubt about Pâs case.  I find it unlikely that P has âlentâ a total of $489,500 to Don the terms alleged by her.  On the contrary, I find the evidence as a whole more consistent with Dâs case that P has âdonatedâmoney towards the purchase of the Property as well as its decoration in the past.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Dâs counterclaim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Counsel for P has submitted in his written closing submission that should the court finds against P in her claim, P is agreeableto vacate the <i>lis pendens</i>.  Furthermore, P is also agreeable to the declaratory relief sought by D. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> D is counterclaiming against P for a declaration that D holds the Property on trust for the Group and/or the Society for the purposesstated in paragraph 4(c)(i) of the Defence and Counterclaim (at Bundle C13). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> It is worth noting that the declaratory relief sought concerns not just the interests of P and D but some other parties, namely,the Group and the Society.  Neither the Group nor the Society is a party to this action.  In fact the term âthe Groupâ has neverbeen clearly defined.  It is defined in paragraph 2(b) of the Defence and Counterclaim (at Bundle C11) as a group of people who frequentlyvisited and gathered at the Temple since 1980âs.  The precise composition of âthe Groupâ is never made clear in the evidence. Indeed, Dâs counsel has apparently appreciated the ambiguity when he explains in his written closing submission why the Propertywas not transferred to the Society back in 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Given the fact that neither the Society nor the Group isa party to this action, it is not appropriate to make any declaration affectingtheir rights in their absence.  This is all the more so as the precise composition of âthe Groupâ is unknown!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> It must also be appreciated that I have so far refrained from making any specifically findings in this judgment about the ownershipof the money in the existing bank accounts and the Property.  In my view, all these matters (including any declaration of trust)can be more appropriately dealt with amongst those concerned themselves.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> There is another reason why the declaration sought by D may not be appropriately dealt with in this action.  According to paragraph4(c)(i) of the Defence and Counterclaim, the purpose of the alleged trust in relation to the Property is for use by the Group asa place for the Group, their friends and/or relatives to gather and worship the Buddha and to study and chant Buddhist sutra andto promote Buddhism.  I consider it inappropriate to make a declaration of trust in such loose term without hearing the evidenceof all those concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Lastly, there is Dâs counterclaim for an injunction restraining P, whether by herself, her servants or agents or otherwise howsoever,from further publishing or causing to be published Pâs claim in terms of the declarations sought or any words of similar effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> According to Dâs counselâs written closing submission, Dâs claim in this regard is founded on the registration in the LandRegistry of the writ herein indorsed with the statement of claim which include Pâs claims of title to the Property.  It is Dâscase that Pâs claims of title to the Property was calculated to disparage and diminish the value of the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Dâs claim in this regard is apparently based on the tort of malicious falsehood.  The essential elements for the tort of maliciousfalsehood has been summarized by Chu J in <i>Hong Kong Wing On Travel Service Limited v. Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 481</a> at 491G-492A as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) The defendant has published about the plaintiff words which are false.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) The defendant did so maliciously in that either:</p>    	<blockquote>           i. he knew 					when he published the words that they were false or he was 					reckless as to whether they were trueor not; or<p>ii. he did 					so for the purpose not of advancing his own interest but of 					injuring the plaintiff.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) Special damage has followed as the direct and natural result of the publication.

I agree with Pâs counsel that there is nothing in the evidence to show that P registered the <i>lis pendens</i> maliciously.  It is Pâs evidence that she registered the <i>lis pendens</i> for the purpose of avoiding any disposal of the Property before the dispute in this action is resolved. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> To start with, according to Gatley on Libel and Slander, 10<sup>th</sup> Edition (2004), para.20.7:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe pursuit of self-interest will not, however, be malice in the context of malicious falsehood where the statement is believedto be true.  In <i>Dunlop v. Maison Talbot</i> Collins MR said that âit [is] not malice if the object of the writer was to push his own business.  To make the act malicious itmust be done with the direct object of injuring that other personâs business.  Therefore, the mere fact that it would injure thatother personâs business [is] no evidence of malice.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> And it is further said in paragraph 20.7 that</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe defendant may have acted stupidly in asserting a right, yet if he <i>bona fide</i> believed such right to exist, no action lies.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf what the defendant has written be most untrue, but nonetheless he believed it, if he was acting under the most vicious of judgments,yet if he exercised that judgment <i>bona fide</i>, it will be a justification to him in this case.  Whether his belief be such as a man of sound sense and knowledge of business wouldhave formed is not the question.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe question here is not what the judgment a sensible man would have formed in this case, but whether the defendant did or didnot entertain the opinion he communicated.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> Pâs action in registering the writ as a <i>lis pendens</i> is consistent with her claim in this action.  There is really nothing in the evidence to challenge the fact that P had <i>bona fide</i> believed in her claim against D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> In the premises, I am not satisfied that D has made out a claim against P on malicious falsehood based on the registration of the<i>lis pendens</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Conclusion and orders</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> By reason of the above, I find for D on Pâs claim.
