The plaintiff alleged that he slipped and fell in the course of work on 29 June 2006. The defendant,his employer, denies liability and disputes quantum.</p>    <p class="heading">LIABILITY</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The defendant operated a textile weaving factory at Factory B and D, 19<sup>th</sup> Floor, Block 1, Tai Ping Industrial Centre, 57 Ting Kok Road at Tai Po in the New Territories.  The plaintiff was employed by thedefendant as a supervisor at the factory and his responsibilities included supervising the work of the machine attendants of theweaving machines at the factory.  These machines were fully automated and computerized and weaved different coloured yarn that wasfed into the machine in order to be to knitted into fabric pieces which could later be stitched together to make an upper garment. Typically, the machines would knit a fabric piece which would form the front of the garment in question, another piece which wouldform the back, and two more pieces which would form the two sleeves of the garment.  One of the duties of the plaintiff was to stretchthe fabric piece generated by the machine, against a measuring tape that was fixed to the front of the machine, to ensure that thefabric piece, when stretched, conformed to the specification of the particular batch of fabric pieces being woven by the machinein question. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The machines operated around the clock and the defendant had arranged for its employees to work in two shifts to oversee the operationsof the factory.  The plaintiff used to work on a night shift but had recently been transferred to work on the day shift which commencedat 8 a.m. in the morning.  According to the plaintiff, the accident occurred at 8:15 a.m., some 15 minutes after he started workon the morning of 29 June 2006. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  As can be seen from the floor plan of the factory premises at p. 500 of the Trial Bundles, the weaving machines were laid out inrows on the factory floor.  The location of the machines was identified by rectangles which were marked on the floor plan.  The numberof the machine it represented was printed on each rectangle and, as can be seen from the plan, there were 125 weaving machines onthe floor in question. There were two supervisors on duty at each shift, each responsible for more than 60 machines. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The fabric pieces, when completely knitted by the machine, would be ejected by the machine and fall onto a tray at the front ofthe machine.  At about 8:15 a.m. on the morning in question, the plaintiff had taken a fabric piece from the tray and had stretchedand measured it against the measuring tape on the front of machine No. 120.  Having completed that work, he turned towards machineNo. 113.  The two machines were facing each other and the gap between the two machines was about 30 inches.  He took one or two stepsturning towards machine No. 113 when one of his feet slipped and he fell backwards.  His buttocks landed on the floor first and thenhis whole body fell back and lay flat on the floor. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is not in dispute that the factory floor was coated with an anti-slip material and that the plaintiff had been wearing rubber-soledshoes at the time.  After he fell, a female machine attendant helped him to get up.  He then saw a piece of flattened yarn fragment,about the size of a tennis ball, about a foot away from the sole of his shoe.  The plaintiff believed that he fell because he hadinadvertently stepped on this fragment of yarn which was slippery. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The plaintiff was subjected to a searching cross-examination by Mr Patrick Lim who appeared on behalf of the defendant.  He wasnot shaken on his version of events.  I accept his testimony and I find that he fell because he inadvertently stepped on a fragmentof yarn which caused him to slip and to fall in the manner as he described.  He slipped and fell, notwithstanding that he was wearingrubber-soled shoes and notwithstanding that the floor was coated with a non-slip material, because the fragment of yarn was slipperyand caused him to lose his footing on the floor.  In making these findings, I also had regard to the fact that the plaintiff hadattended the Accident and Emergency Department of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, shortly after the accident, where he hadgiven a history of having slipped and fallen at work that morning.  </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It was common ground that these fragments of yarn were created when the yarn became jammed in the yarn transfer device which fedthe yarn into the weaving machine.  When that happened, the thread would break, and the alarm would sound, and the weaving machinewould stop operation.  However, the yarn transfer device would continue to spin and create a ball of yarn fragments.  There was disagreementbetween the plaintiff and Mr Mo Ka Shun, the defendantâs manager who gave evidence for the defendant, regarding frequency and thesize of these yarn fragments. Mr Mo said that this breakage of yarn and the creation of these yarn fragments occurred very occasionally,only about once per machine per shift and that the ball of yarn created would not exceed a size of a Hong Kong 5-dollar coin.  Theplaintiff said that the ball of yarn produced this way was the size of a tennis ball.  Both the plaintiff and Mr Mo said that themachine attendant would pick up the ball of yarn from the yarn transfer device and discard it in the plastic dustbin that was placedat the front of every machine, next to the tray which received the finished woven fabric pieces.  The plaintiff said that this binwas usually full to over filling by the end of the night shift, and that a lot of yarn fragments spilled over onto the floor. MrMoâs evidence, on the other hand, was that the dustbin was never full and that the factory floor was always clean and free of yarnresidues and rejects. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  I have carefully considered the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr Mo and conclude that I accept the evidence of Mr Mo as being inherentlymore probable.  I find that the evidence of the plaintiff contained elements of exaggeration, particularly in relation to the extentof woollen residues on the factory floor, the difficulty he faced in stretching the fabric pieces to ensure that they were of thecorrect size, and the need for him to push heavy trolleys of yarn reels to the factory floor during the night shift on the occasionswhen the machines worked very efficiently and the yarn allocated to them was all used up.  Indeed, if the factory floor had beenfull of these yarn residues, the plaintiff should have been aware of this and should have instructed the machine attendants to clearthem away or taken care not to step on them when he was attending to his work that morning on the machines in question.  On the contrary,the plaintiffâs evidence, which I accept, was that prior to the accident, he did not see any yarn residues on the floor.  He alsosaid that he did not pay attention to that.  Even so, if there were as many yarn residues on the floor as he claimed, the plaintiffshould have become aware of their presence. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  However, I was impressed by and accept the evidence of the plaintiff when he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe machine attendant would pull out the residue at the yarn transfer device. He would aim to throw it into the rubbish bin. Ifit landed in the bin, fine; but, if not, he would not pick it up from the floor and put it back into the bin.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  That evidence had a ring of truth about it and I find, on a balance of possibilities, that this was what occurred that morning,that the plaintiff inadvertently stepped on a piece of yarn fragment lying on the floor in the gap between the two machines and slippedand fell as a result.  To his credit, Mr Mo was very frank and readily conceded that, whilst the floor was coated with a non-slipsurface and therefore was not slippery, the yarn fragments, which were made of yarn fibres that had been waxed, were slippery. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Mo was very clear in his evidence that the machine attendant who pulled out the fragment of yarn from the yarn transfer deviceshould then put that fragment into the dustbin.  I find that the machine attendance who worked during the night shift was negligentin causing or permitting the yarn fragment to fall on the floor in the vicinity of machine No. 113.  The plaintiff slipped and fellas a result of that negligent conduct for which the defendant is vicariously liable. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It is understandable why Mr Mo said that the machine attendants should put the fragments of yarn into the dustbin.  The yarn fibreshad been waxed to facilitate the weaving process.  Mr Mo agreed that the ball of rejected yarn fibres was waxy and slippery.  Themachine attendant dealing with these yarn fragments owed a duty to his or her co-employees not to cause or permit the yarn fragmentsto fall on the floor and to pose a hazard to other employees who might inadvertently step on them and slip and fall as a result.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the light of these findings, the evidence about other sources of yarn fragments or residues is irrelevant to the accident inquestion and I need not be concerned about that evidence.  I must, however, address the plaintiffâs case that the defendant wasnegligent in failing to provide a safe and proper system of cleaning the factory premises. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  There was undisputed evidence that two cleaners had been employed by the defendant to clean the entire factory during the day shift,one starting each dayâs work at 8 a.m. and the other at 9 a.m.  There were no cleaners employed to clean the factory premises duringthe night shift hours, i.e. from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. the following morning.  I do not accept the evidence of the plaintiff that theplastic bins at the front of the weaving machines were overflowing by the end of the night shift and that a failure to have cleaningworkers during the night shift resulted in a hazardous situation for the employees on the factory premises, with the floor of thepremises being littered by yarn fragments as well as yarn threads and incomplete partially knitted fabric pieces. I accept the evidenceof Mr Mo that there was no need to hire cleaning workers for the night shift and that all the yarn fragments and yarn residues collectedfrom all the dustbins on the factory floor would not fill up an ordinary carton box. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  There was some evidence given about the need to use compressed air hoses (also referred to as air guns) to clean the machines atthe beginning of the morning shift and which process resulted in a lot of dirt and yarn threads being blown onto the floor.  However,by the time of the closing submissions, it became clear that this process had nothing to do with the accident that occurred.  Thisprocess resulted in dirt and yarn threads being deposited on the floor in the vicinity of the machines being âhosedâ.  I acceptthe evidence of Mr Mo, and the defence case, that the cleaning workers employed would clean, every morning, the floor underneaththe machines and clear the dustbins at the front of each machine, as well as clear away the dirt and yarn residues generated by thehosing process. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I do not find any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.  He was intent on his job at the time and he inadvertentlystepped on the yarn fragment which caused him to slip and fall. Ironically, if I had accepted his evidence that the factory floorwas littered with such yarn fragments, I would have found him guilty of contributory negligence for failing to look out for theseyarn fragments, when he moved from one machine to the other in the course of his work, and for failing to instruct the machine attendantsto clear them away. </p>    <p class="heading">QUANTUM</p>    <p class="heading">(1)     Injuries and Treatment</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The plaintiff attended the Accident &amp; Emergency Department of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital shortly after the accident. As recorded in the report from the Accident &amp; Emergency Department dated 10 January 2007, the plaintiff gave a history of slipand fall with low back contusion.  Examination revealed stiffness of low back.  X-ray of lumbar spine was normal.  He was dischargedhome at 10:40 a.m. and granted sick leave up to 2 July 2006.  He returned to the Accident &amp; Emergency Department on 3 July 2006. Examination revealed tenderness at his lower back around L4/5 region.  His back was stiff with decreased range of movement.  Therewas no neurological deficit over his lower limbs.  He was given an intramuscular analgesic and discharged with referral to physiotherapy.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  From 7 July to 5 August 2006, he was seen and received medication for pain relief at the Tin Shui Wai Health Centre.  From there,he was referred to the orthopaedic clinic of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital and seen on 8 August 2006.  At the follow up on3 October 2006, the plaintiff reported an overall 50% improvement of his low back pain and his main complaint was inability to liftheavy loads as required by his work.  Because of the slow progress, an MRI scan was booked and the plaintiff referred to the painspecialist clinic.  At a visit on 2 January 2007, the plaintiff reported that his back pain improvement was static, with on and offexacerbation, and that his walking tolerance was 30 minutes. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Eventually, an MRI scan was arranged for him in June 2007.  The report of the radiologist was that that the MRI scan showed milddisc degeneration present at L5/S1.  At L5/S1, there was a central, left paracentral disc extrusion.  The thecal sac was indentedanteriorly.  The central canal was narrowed.  The extruded disc was compressing on the left descending nerve root.  The exiting nerveroots were not compressed.  No facet joint arthrosis was evident.  There was no prolapsed disc in the rest of the lumbar levels andno visible spondylosis. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Dr Johnson Lam, the orthopaedics specialist, was appointed by both parties as the single joint expert in this case and prepareda report on the plaintiff after his examination and assessment of the plaintiff on 15 May 2009.  In his report dated 18 May 2009,Dr Lam concluded that the plaintiff had suffered soft tissue injury to his back which was consistent with the mechanism of injurydescribed by him, namely, that he had stepped on some waste bits of textile and fell back and landed on his buttocks and low backarea.  He referred to the MRI scan taken in June 2007.  He also found, from the x-rays taken at his assessment, that mild degenerativechanges with small osteophytes around L3/4 and L4/5 discs were present.  On the other hand, while the L5/S1 disc space was reduced,there was no osteophyte noted.  Taking into account the MRI and x-ray findings, Dr Lam was of the opinion, and which I accept, thatit was likely that the subject injury was an important causal factor of the disc extrusion at L5/S1 level, resulting in persistentpain in the low back area. It was also probable that the subject injury aggravated the pre-existing degeneration of the back (especiallyaround L3/4 and L4/5 discs), resulting in persistent low back pain. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In his supplemental report dated 6 April 2010, Dr Lam was of the opinion that 10% of the plaintiffâs current condition shouldbe apportioned to the pre-existing degeneration in his back. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  At the time of his assessment in May 2009, he found that there was some muscle guarding but no muscle spasm at the lumbar region. There was mild reduction in straight-leg-raising on the left side, but there was no objective neurological deficit on physical examination. The overall findings suggested some residual back pain and disability of a moderate degree. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Dr Lam concluded that the plaintiff suffered an 8% permanent impairment of the whole person.  Activities that cause an increasedphysical demand on the back were likely to cause discomfort or even pain in the back.  Those activities included prolonged standing,frequent lifting of heavy objects or bending of the back, and other heavy manual labour requiring exertion of the back.  However,the plaintiff was independent in most activities of daily living including self care and hygiene, although he probably had some difficultyin cutting toenails. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I have no hesitation in accepting the opinion of Dr Lam on these matters.  I have taken account of the video surveillance of theplaintiff which showed that the plaintiff walked normally and even briskly.  That evidence does not cause me to doubt that the plaintiffsuffers from a genuine back problem. </p>    <p class="heading">(2)     PSLA</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I was referred to a number of authorities on the award of PSLA in back cases.  Relying on the authorities he had cited, Mr AlbertYau for the plaintiff asked me to award $400,000 as damages under this head.  Mr Patrick Lim for the defendant said that the appropriateaward should be $200,000, discounted by 20% for pre-existing degeneration, to produce an award of $160,000. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I have reviewed the various authorities cited to me.  I find assistance from the following cases and I have been guided by themon my assessment of the proper award for damages for PSLA :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     <i>San To Po Yuk v Wong Kwong Painting Company Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20HKLRD%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 HKLRD 169</a> at 178E-179I (CFI) (PSLA: $350,000);</p>        <p>(b)     <i>Shan Nisar v Wai Kit Engineering Co.

I would have awarded a slightly higher amountbut for the fact that there was pre-existing degeneration of his back at the time of the accident. </p>    <p class="heading">(3)     Loss of Earnings/Loss of Earning Capacity</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Dr Lam offered the following opinion on the plaintiffâs employment capacity :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEmployability: Referring to Mr Chan, his pre-accident job, his pre-accident job as textile factory (knitting) worker required working12 hours a day (including 1 hour for lunch). He said in this job he needed to stand and walk for long hours, and he needed to repair/servicemachines which required exertion. He said when the machines were not running smoothly, he would be very busy all day. Occasionallyhe needed to squat in repairing machines. He said he also needed to push heavy objects (several hundred lbs in weight) on trolleys.My overall opinion is that Mr Chan would have difficulty in returning to the full duties of this job. As an alternative, he shouldbe able to work in jobs requiring lighter physical demand on the back would be more suitable. Examples include being a salespersonselling light goods, a driver, or a security guard in posts that allow him to alternate between sitting, standing and walking.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Dr Lam referred to the period of sick leave granted to the plaintiff, which was for the period from 29 June 2006 to 18 October 2007and then again from 20 October 2007 to 17 April 2008.  After considering the severity of injury, the need for rehabilitation, theprogress of treatment, and the pre-accident job demand, Dr Lam formed the opinion that the duration of sick leave approved by theplaintiffâs treating doctors who assessed him from time to time was appropriate. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Patrick Lim for the defendant submitted that the opinion of Dr Lam on these issues was not binding on his client notwithstandingthat he was a single joint expert for both parties. Mr Lim submitted that his client had clearly disputed the plaintiffâs caseon the job demands on his pre-accident work.  According to the witness statement of Mr Mo Ka Shun, the plaintiffâs work was supervisoryin nature.  He was not required to change the cotton yarn reels of the knitting machines.  An external company had been engaged toundertake that task.  With respect of maintenance work, minor problems would be fixed by the individual machine attendants.  Eachknitting machine came with its own computer and the machine attendant would use the computer to rectify minor problems.  They wererequired to report to the supervisors, including the plaintiff, in case more serious problems arose, and the supervisors would thencontact technicians from an external company to carry out the repair works.  The extent of the physical demands of the job as supervisorwas clearly in dispute between the parties and an issue which I have to resolve in these proceedings.  It is also common ground thatI am not bound to accept the opinion of Dr Lam on these issues.  Accordingly, I permitted the defendant to proceed on the basis thatit was not bound by the opinion of the single joint expert on these issues notwithstanding that it had not sought his opinion onthe plaintiffâs ability to return to his pre-accident work which, as asserted by the defendant, was largely sedentary in nature. I shall address below to what extent such opinion evidence is admissible in any event and, if admissible, to what extent, if any,it is binding on the trial judge. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The plaintiff gave evidence that his work as supervisor was not light duty.  He explained that it required strength to stretch thefabric piece to its fullest extent. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The plaintiff also said that if the yarn became jammed inside the machine, the panel at the top of the machine had to be liftedso that the offending material could be removed.  This was heavy work because the screws of the panel, similar to those that canbe seen on the photograph at p.680F, had to be removed and the panel, which was heavy, had to be lifted up.  He also gave evidencethat there were many occasions when the need arose for him to push heavy trolleys of yarn reels to the factory floor during the nightshift.  This occurred on the occasions when the machines worked very efficiently, without stoppage, and the yarn reels allocatedto them were all used up. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Moâs evidence, on the other hand, was that the work of a supervisor was light duty.  He adopted what he had said in his witnessstatement about the duties of the supervisor, and he produced two garments, one knitted with a broad needle and the other knittedwith a fine needle, which were typical of the garments made from the fabric pieces produced by these machines.  He demonstrated howthey had to be stretched to ensure that the fabric piece was produced according to specification.  He explained that it was not necessaryto stretch them to their fullest extent as that might cause the knitted yarn threads to break.  They had to be stretched in orderto see whether or not their size conformed to the size mentioned in the specification.  About 3 lbs of strength or force was requiredto stretch these fabric pieces.  He also said that odd job workers transported the yarn reels in trolleys to the factory floor duringthe day shift.  These odd job workers were not employed during the night shift because there was no need to transport the yarn reelsat night as everything would be placed and positioned during the day time shift.  He also said that the supervisors were not requiredto open up the panel of the machines and that he had never seen anyone do that.  When a machine stopped and had to be restarted manually,there was a computer function which could be utilized for the partially woven fabric to be ejected from the machine.  Apart fromutilizing that function, nothing else had to be done for the partially woven fabric piece to be ejected from the machine. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I accept the evidence of Mr Mo who gave evidence in a straight forward manner.  His evidence appeared to me to be inherently moreprobable.  I gained the impression from viewing the photographs of the factory that the factory was well organised and efficientlyrun.  The floor of the factory appeared to me to be clean, and the trolleys containing the knitted fabric pieces and the yarn reelshad been arranged and placed in a very orderly fashion.  The machines depicted on the photographs of the factory appeared to me tobe very sophisticated machines requiring very little human intervention for them to carry out their intended functions. I also triedto stretch the two garment exhibits produced to me.  It was quite easy to stretch the lighter garment that had been knitted witha fine needle.  The heavier garment, knitted with a broad needle, required more effort.  Mr Moâs description of the force required,about 3 lbs of strength, is a good estimate of the force required to stretch the heavier garment. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I accept the evidence of Mr Mo on the nature of the work of the supervisor and I find that the plaintiff was exaggerating the difficultiesinherent in that job. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I conclude that the plaintiff could have returned to his pre-accident employment after the expiry of his sick leave.  In fact, hedid return to work for the defendant but was made redundant because the defendant was relocating its factory premises in Dongguan,China. Mr Mo gave evidence that Hong Kong residents were recruited to work as supervisors in the Dongguan factory at a pay higherthan that they would have received for the same work in Hong Kong because working in China, away from oneâs home and family inHong Kong, was regarded as a hardship.  The plaintiff gave evidence that he did not want to leave his home and family in Hong Kongto work in China. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The plaintiff gave me the following history of his working life.  He started work at the age of 18 doing interior decoration workas a painting worker and was accredited by the Construction Training Authority.  He had worked as a painter for almost 20 years upto the age of about 36.  At that time, SARS had struck Hong Kong and the construction industry was depressed.  He therefore decidedto move to another line of work and, in 2003, started to work as a machine attendant of weaving machines. He worked for a weavingfactory in Hong Kong.  He worked for that factory from April 2003 to September 2005.  In July 2004, he was promoted to the positionof supervisor and in September 2005, he commenced work for the defendant as a supervisor.  When his sick leave expired in April 2008,the plaintiff returned to work for the defendant but was made redundant.  He then tried a number of occupations, not very successfully,before taking up employment as a marker in a billiard saloon, which is the job that he currently holds, earning substantially lessthan the earnings of a supervisor. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Although I have found that the plaintiff can return to work as a supervisor in a weaving factory, I do not go so far as to findthat he failed to mitigate his loss by failing to take up employment as a supervisor in China.  With the continual relocation ofHong Kongâs textile industry to China, work as a supervisor in Hong Kong is obviously more and more difficult to find.  However,the plaintiff was perfectly entitled to choose to stay and live with his family in Hong Kong, and to work in Hong Kong, and I findthat it was reasonable for him to make that choice. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In my judgment, the loss of the plaintiffâs job as a supervisor and the consequent reduction in his salary in alternative employmentwas not caused by the accident he suffered, but by redundancy and the relocation of the defendantâs factory to China.  The questionof the responsibility for such loss is not, in my judgment, to be resolved by reference to the duty to mitigate, i.e. was it reasonablefor the plaintiff to travel back and forth to China to work as a supervisor, but by reference to the more basic question: did thetort complained of in the present case cause this specific loss, namely, the reduction in the plaintiffâs earnings.  The answer,clearly and simply, is no.  The loss has been caused by changing market conditions and the consequent effect of those changes onthe labour market in Hong Kong.  Even if he had not suffered this accident, the plaintiff would not have gone to work at the defendantâsfactory in Dongguan, after its relocation there, but would have tried to find alternative employment in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As the plaintiff is able to return to work as a supervisor but the market conditions in Hong Kong are such that such work is notreadily available for him, I conclude that I cannot award damages for future loss or earnings on a multiplier/multiplicand basisby taking the his pre-accident earnings as a supervisor and deducting from that his current earnings and by applying a multiplierto the difference.  However, that is not to say that the plaintiff has not suffered a loss of earning capacity.  The injury he sustainedin the accident has disabled him from returning to any form of heavy manual labour.  He used to earn $20,000 a month as a painterbefore changing his line of work and performing lighter duty as a machine attendant and later as a supervisor.  If the accident hadnot occurred, and he had been made redundant, as a result of the relocation of the defendantâs factory to Dongguan, he might havechosen to go back to his former employment as a painter.  That, of course, is only a possibility and not a certainty, not even aprobability, given the fact that he had a pre-existing degenerative condition of his back and had gained weight in recent years,and given the fact that he had made a decision to change his employment to perform lighter work. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Even so, the loss of earning capacity that the plaintiff has suffered is a real loss and ought to be compensated by a global awardof damages.  Similar awards have been made in cases such as <i>Choy Wai Chung v Chun Wo Construction &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd</i>, HCPI No. 605 of 1999, Beeson J; 16 December 2003, where an award of $600,000 was made as damages for loss of earning capacity toa construction site engineer who was office-bound after the accident he had suffered and no longer able to work outdoors, and in<i>Yau Shui Ming v Excellent Development Ltd.</i> DCPI No. 47 of 2002, Lok DJ; 28 May 2003, where $150,000 was awarded to the plaintiff who was earning an income equivalent to hispre-accident income in alternative employment after the accident, but who had lost his post-accident job as a result of the economicdownturn associated with the outbreak of SARS. Having regard to the plaintiffâs previous income as a painter in the region of $20,000per month and his earnings as a supervisor at the defendantâs factory in the sum of $15,088 per month, and having regard to hiscurrent age of 39, I assess damages for loss of earning capacity on a global basis in the sum of $200,000 in the present case. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  How much should I award as damages for pre-trial loss of earnings?  On the basis that the pre-accident employment of the defendantrequired him to stand and walk for long hours, to repair and service machines which required exertion and which also required himto squat, and the requirement to push heavy objects on trolleys, Dr Lam formed the opinion that the duration of sick leave, approvedby the plaintiffâs treating doctors who had assessed him from time to time, was appropriate.  That period of sick leave was a periodof about 22 months. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I have already found that the plaintiff has exaggerated the requirements of his job as supervisor.  As I have found, he was notrequired to perform strenuous work, only light work.  And as I have pointed out above, the defendantâs solicitors did not go backto Dr Lam for his opinion on what was the reasonable period of sick leave for the plaintiff if he was only required to perform lightduty, and not heavy work.  Notwithstanding this, Mr Lim for the defendant relied on the authority of the Court of Appeal in <i>Tam Fu Yip Fip v Sincere Engineering &amp; Trading Co. Ltd</i>, CACV No. 208 of 2007, 8 April 2008, to submit that the Court was not bound by the sick leave certificates and that I had to makemy own assessment based on the evidence.  In that case, Le Pichon JA, giving the judgment of the court, said at p. 6T-7E :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSick leave certificates are no more than a piece of evidence that has to be evaluated in the light of all the available evidenceincluding medical evidence before the court. As Rogers VP observed in <i>Choy Wai Chung v Chun Wo Construction &amp; Engineering Company Ltd</i>, CACV 172/2004, 15 July 2005 at Â§ 9, the judge cannot be bound by the mere issue of sick leave certificates: the issuance of suchcertificates would be primarily because of the subjective symptoms reported to the doctors by the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Lim submitted that Dr Lamâs endorsement of the sick leave period was based on the plaintiffâs exaggerated claims and thatI should only allow a period of 9 months for pre-trial loss of earnings, 6 months for the soft tissue injury to the lower back toheal, and another 3 months for the plaintiff to look for suitable employment.  Whilst I do not accept the opinion of Dr Lam thata period of sick leave of 22 months was reasonable, which was premised on the plaintiffâs statements that his work as a supervisorwas heavy duty, I do not agree with Mr Limâs submissions.  The plaintiff suffered more than soft tissue injury to his lower back. Dr Lam was of the opinion, and which I accept, that the accident was a causally important factor of the disc extrusion at L5/S1level, resulting in persistent pain in the low back area.  Having reviewed the medical consultation notes of the plaintiffâs out-patientvisits from June 2006 to April 2008, appearing at pp. 315-341 of the Trial Bundles, I conclude that I ought to allow the plaintiffa period of 18 months to recover from his injury resulting from the accident, after which period he ought to have been able him toreturn to light duty work.  On that basis, the award for pre-trial loss of earnings ought to be in the sum of $285,163.20, inclusiveof loss of MPF benefits during this 18-month period ($15,088 x 18 months x 105%). </p>    <p class="heading">(4)     The proper procedure to be followed when parties wish to seek clarification of opinions expressed in a joint expert report</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  This issue has not been addressed in the Personal Injuries Practice Direction PD18.1. </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Where there is a dispute as to the factual requirements of the pre-accident employment, the joint instructions to the single jointexpert, or to the experts appointed to prepare a joint report, should outline the different factual versions to the expert(s) concernedand his or their expert opinion should be sought on each separate version.  The provisions contained in Â§87 of PD18.1 address andcontemplate a situation where the joint report contains opinions, based on common parameters as well as on different parameters. Where those parameters can only be known after an exercise of fact finding by the trial judge, an expert should not himself embarkon any fact finding exercise but should offer his opinion based on one version and his different opinion, if, indeed, it be different,based on the other version(s).  </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  That did not happen in the present case and Dr Lam offered his opinion based on the plaintiffâs version of his pre-accident workrequirements.  In this situation the other party, receiving the joint report and seeing that it contained opinion based on disputedfacts, should seek the expertâs opinion based on that partyâs version of the disputed facts.  Obviously, it is wrong for a partyto approach the maker(s) of a joint report without informing the other side.  I agree with Mr Lim that in a situation such as thepresent, or when clarification is sought from the maker(s) of a joint report, the proper procedure should be:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     The party raising any question for clarification should in the first instance write to the other party and seek his consentfor the question to be put to be expert(s). </p>        <p>(b)     If the other party does not agree to the question raised, he may propose a different question for the consideration of theparty that raised the matter. </p>        <p>(c)      If consensus cannot be reached between the parties then the party that wishes to seek clarification should take out a summonsbefore the PI Master to determine the matter. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In resolving the dispute the PI Master would no doubt be guided by Â§84 of PD18.1 and impose sanctions on the party acting unreasonablyin the matter by raising matters which went beyond clarification or by unreasonably refusing to agree to proper questions being putto the expert(s) to clarify genuine issues.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The guidance offered above should not be construed as a carte blanche to seek clarification.  Parties should take care to composejoint instructions which deal with all relevant matters. In the normal course of events, there should be no need for a joint reportto be amplified or tested by cross-examination.  As Lord Woolf LCJ said in Â§28 of his judgment in <i>Peet v Mid-Kent Healthcare Trust</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20WLR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 WLR 210</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf it needs amplification, or if it should be subject to cross-examination, the court has a discretion to allow that to happen.The court may permit that to happen either prior to the hearing or at the hearing. But the assumption should be that the single jointexpertâs report is the evidence. Any amplification or any cross examination should be restricted as far as possible.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I am grateful to Mr Albert Yau for drawing my attention to the UK provisions contained in CPR 35.6 which state :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWritten questions to experts</p>        <p class="quote">35.6â (1) A party may put written questions about an expertâs report (which must be proportionate) toâ</p>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) an expert instructed by another party; or</p>                <p class="quote">(b) a single joint expert appointed under rule 35.7.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">(2) Written question under paragraph (1)-</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) may be put once only;</p>                <p class="quote">(b) must be put with 28 days of service of the expertâs report; and</p>                <p class="quote">(c) must be for the purpose only of clarification of the report;</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">unless in any caseâ</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(i) The court gives permission; or</p>                <p class="quote">(ii) the other party agrees.</p>                <p class="quote">(3) An expertâs answers to questions put in accordance with paragraph (1) shall be treated as part of the expertâs report.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">(4) Whereâ</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a) a party has put a written question to an expert instructed by another party; and</p>                <p class="quote">(b) the expert does not answer that question, the court may make one or both of the following orders in relation to the party whoinstructed the expertâ</p>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">(i) that the part may not rely on the evidence of that expert; or</p>                    <p class="quote">(ii)   that the part may not recover the fees and expenses of that expert from any other party.â</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>This rule was not adopted in Hong Kong because the CJâs Working Party on Civil Justice Reform noted that the UK provisions wereoften misused and that are questions that went beyond âclarificationâ were being raised, sometimes months after the expert reportwas issued: Â§606 of the Final Report of the working Party at p. 321.

Rogers JA, as he then was, agreed with counselâs criticism of that opinion and said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â11. An expert witness can give evidence as to the nature of the plaintiffâs injuries, what effect that has on the plaintiff physicallyand what lasting effect that is likely to have. Statements of opinion in relation to earning capacity are, in my view, inadmissible,either from a doctor or even from an occupational therapist. Indeed, to a large extent, they seem to me to be confusing, at best,and meaningless at worst. The expression of the earning capacity in percentage terms is particularly unhelpful and indeed confusingbecause it is imprecise.</p>        <p class="quote">12.  On a practical level, it could be said that insofar as Alice Tsangâs report, based upon results of tests, concluded that theplaintiff was capable of limited lighter jobs in carpentry or that he had limited capability for lifting heavy items, that is usefulmaterial for the judge.  Insofar as there is speculation as to whether fellow workers could perform the task of moving heavy itemsor additional staff could be employed or whether the plaintiff could work as a sub-contractor and what effect that his long experiencein the field would have on his ability to do so, those, in my view, constitute inadmissible statements.  It is for the court to drawits own conclusions as regards those matters from the evidence before it.  All the more so, it is for the court to draw its own conclusionsas to the earning capacity of the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mayo VP agreed and said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â24. I also find myself in agreement with the observations made concerning the evidence given by Dr Mao and Ms Alice Tsang. Clearlyany expert evidence given by them should have been confined to the Plaintiffâs medical condition. It was not permissible for themto venture to give opinions relating to the labour market a subject upon which they were not competent to express an opinion.</p>        <p class="quote">25.  It is however clear from the judgment that the Judge reached the conclusions he did by making his own assessment of the position. His task was not a simple one by virtue of the Plaintiff making no real attempt to rejoin the labour market as a skilled carpenter. The Judge was in my view fully entitled to find that having regard to the extent of his incapacity he would have been able to continueworking as a carpenter even though he may not have been able to lift heavy weights.  In my view the Judge may have erred on the sideof generosity in the amount of sick leave he allowed and in allowing a 10% loss of earning capacity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  To properly understand these observations, it is necessary to appreciate and distinguish a fundamental difference in the assessmentof damages for loss of earnings and earning capacity at common law and in the assessment of compensation under the Employeesâ CompensationOrdinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a> (âECOâ). The latter exercise requires an assessment of loss of earning capacity to be made in accordancewith the provisions of sections 7, 9 and the First Schedule of the ECO.  As Sir Alan Huggins VP said in <i>Hong Kong Paper Mills Ltd v Chan Hin-wu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 556</a>, at p. 558 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere is a great difference between a claim for damages in negligence at Common Law and a claim for compensation under the WorkmenâsCompensation Ordinance. Workmenâs compensation must be assessed solely under the statutory provisions â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In cases of permanent partial incapacity, an assessment of the compensation payable for total permanent incapacity under section7 must first be carried out to arrive at a base figure to which is applied the percentage of loss of earning capacity derived undersection 9.  That percentage is determined by reference to the First Schedule of the ECO which specifies percentages of loss of earningcapacity for various injuries.  Subject to the provisions of section 9(1A), which cater for cases with special circumstances, thespecified percentage will be applied to the base figure to produce the amount of compensation payable for scheduled injuries.  AsSir Owen Woodhouse said in <i>Lau Ho Wah v Lau Chi Piu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%201061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 1061</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... the calculations provided by the Schedule are intended to reflect a general expectation based on average experience and soprovide reasonably swift answers in terms of broad justice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In cases of non-scheduled injuries, the assessment of loss of earning capacity, pursuant to section 9(1)(b) and the provisos ofthat sub-section, must reflect and be proportionate to the fixed statutory percentages provided for the scheduled injuries.  Medicalexperts, particularly orthopaedic experts, are familiar with the First Schedule of the ECO and the Notes thereto and are adept atassessing the percentage of loss of earning capacity for non-scheduled cases and they regularly do so when preparing in their expertreports for employeesâ compensation cases.  Those reports are admissible and of assistance to the District Court in assessing compensationfor non-scheduled cases which do not require special treatment under the provisions of section 9(1A). </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The same reports that were prepared for employeesâ compensation cases are often reused in the claim for common law damages.  Thatis why courts assessing common law damages often come across expert opinion on loss of earning capacity. Rogers JA was clearly rightto say that the expression of earning capacity in percentage terms was unhelpful in the assessment of damages at common law. Theapplication of such percentages in the assessment of common law damages has been the subject of criticism by the Privy Council in<i>Chan Wai Tong v</i> <i>Li Ping Sum</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 446.</a>  The Court of Appeal in that case had taken into account the evidence that the appellant from time to time was away from work altogetherand then was off work for half days, a situation which was likely to continue in the future.  On that basis the Court of Appeal wishedto award damages for loss of earning capacity which the Court of Appeal assessed as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><a name="p28" id="p28">â28.</a>    The difficulty is to put a figure on this loss.  The appellantâs present income is admitted by the respondents to be $3,000a month.  One doctor assessed the appellant's incapacity or disability at 25%, the other at perhaps 15%.  We think a reasonable wayof assessing loss of future earning capacity would be to take a midway percentage figure, namely 20% and say that her loss of earningcapacity will be of the order of $600 a month, that is one fifth of her present salary.  That means that the loss of future earningcapacity is $7,200 a year and we see no reason to apply a multiplier of less than 15 to that sum.  Therefore the total sum for lossof future earning capacity is $108,000. That deals with the item of general damages.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Privy Council advised that this award should be set aside.  In his judgment, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton expressed the view thatthe method adopted by the Court of Appeal to assess the award was erroneous :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Court of Appeal first referred to the fact that one doctor had assessed the plaintiff's disability at 25 per cent. and theother at 15 per cent. They took a âmidway percentage figureâ of 20 per cent. In so doing they erred by failing to have regardto the fact that the figure of 15 per cent. was assessed by Dr. Chan eight months later than the 25 per cent. assessed by Dr. Dickinsonand at a time when, contrary to Dr. Dickinsonâs prognosis, the plaintiffâs condition had improved. They also made a more seriouserror of principle by assuming that a 20 per cent. disability necessarily implied a 20 per cent. loss of future earning capacity.For the reasons which their Lordships have already explained, that is not so. The effect of the disability on a particular claimantâsearning capacity may vary greatly according to the age and particularly to the nature of the employment of the particular claimant,and that matter seems to have been ignored by the Court of Appeal.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Expert opinion on the percentage of loss of earning capacity is helpful and admissible in employeesâ compensation proceedings. The guidance that Rogers JA has offered to the courts assessing damages at common law should not be so readily accepted, as it appearsto have been done, by the courts assessing employeesâ compensation (see, for example, <i>Woo Wai Kuen v Liu Siu Keung, Alex trading as Alexâs Kitchen</i>, DCEC489/2000, <i>Law Siu See v De Rodeo Human Resources Ltd</i>, DCEC989/2001, <i>Chan Kam Sau v Yee Hing Construction Transportation Co. Ltd</i>, DCEC1361/2005 and <i>Kan Wai Yip v Everbest Port Services Ltd</i>, DCEC 383/2008).  The expertise of the medical practitioner in assessing the percentage of loss of earning capacity for non-scheduledcases is likely to be of assistance to the court assessing employeesâ compensation.  <i>Chan Kam v Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong Trustees Ltd</i> [1988]1 HKC 345 is an example of a case where the Court of Appeal found the opinion of the expert on the percentage of loss of causingcapacity to be of assistance. However, expert opinion on the percentage of loss of earning capacity does not assist the court inassessing damages at common law.  But so long as it is understood that the opinion was expressed for the assistance of the courtassessing employeesâ compensation, it is not necessary for that opinion to be struck out from the same report being used in thecommon law action. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  However, the exclusion of expert opinion on the percentage of loss of earning capacity in common law cases should not include, withit, the exclusion of the expertâs opinion on the type of work the injured person can perform after his recovery.  In <i>Li Wan Choi v Choi Wan Hing &amp; Anor,</i> CACV182/2000, 15 November 2000, Rogers VP and Le Pichon JA reiterated that statements of percentages of loss of earning capacitywere of little assistance to the Court.  Nevertheless, they accepted and had regard to the evidence of the expert as to the typeof work the plaintiff could perform after the accident (see Â§Â§ 7, 22 and 24 of the Judgment).  The court can often apply its ownknowledge and experience of different job requirements to come to a view of what type of work an injured person can perform afterthe accident.  Such opinion evidence coming from the expert falls within that type of opinion that Mr Albert Yau in his helpful submissions,which I accept, classified as âextend[ing] to matters which the Court, in full command of its judicial experience and common sense,may come to an almost instant impression that it will be in just as good a position as the expert in coming to its own conclusion.â However, Mr Yau cautioned against the outright rejection of such opinion evidence in every case.  I agree. Whilst the matter mayultimately be for the trial judge, such opinion evidence is helpful to the parties and conducive to enabling the parties to negotiatea settlement of the case.  The exclusion of such evidence from the joint report of the expert(s) may result in increased controversyand drive the parties to require adjudication of the issue by the court instead of resolving the dispute by negotiation or mediation.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Before I leave this area, I ought to make mention of the recent tendency of experts to omit from their reports an assessment ofthe permanent impairment of the injured person according the <i>American Medical Associationâs Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> Ed<i>.</i> (â<i>AMAâs Guides</i>â).  This is a well accepted and well recognised guide to the assessment of disablement based on the World Health OrganisationâsInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (âICFâ), a comprehensive model of disablement based on impairmentof body functions and structures, activity limitations, and restrictions on the personâs ability to participate in activities ofdaily life.  The assessment of permanent impairment is helpful to the court in assessing the award of damages for PSLA.  It helpsthe court to harmonise PSLA awards for different types of bodily injury.  In <i>Li Wan Choi v Choi Wan Hing &amp; Anor.,</i> CACV182/2000, 15 November 2000, Rogers VP and Le Pichon JA referred to the medical evidence and said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5.   â¦ Both doctors had found that there was some residual disability.  They expressed themselves, at that stage, in terms of apercentage degree of permanent physical disability and loss of earning capacity.  Dr Chang put the permanent physical disabilityat 9% and the loss of earning capacity at 10%.  Dr Chun put the combined whole person impairment as 8% and the loss of earning capacityin the region of 15%. </p>        <p class="quote">6.    We regret that, as with other judges before us, we find these percentages of very little assistance.  The closest that one cangain some insight into the meaning of the percentages is that in his evidence before the master Dr Chun said that with a 5% impairmentof the spine, and of the whole person as a result of the spine, one is expected to be able to do frequent lifting of about 20 lbsand occasional lifting of about 50 lbs.  He did not go on to explain what the appropriate figures might be for the percentages whichhe assessed the plaintiff.  In matters such as this we do not consider that it is possible to make any straight-line extrapolationof the figures based on the increased percentages of impairment for which the plaintiff was assessed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The statement that âthese percentages [were] of very little assistanceâ was made in the context of the assessment of the awardfor loss of earnings.  Clearly, the assessment of the permanent impairment of the whole person based on the <i>AMAâs Guides</i> does not help the court to assess the award for damages for loss of earnings unless, of course, the assessment of the permanent impairmentis 100%.  However the assessment of the permanent impairment of the whole person based on the <i>AMAâs Guides</i> is of considerable assistance to the court in assessing the proper award of damages for PSLA and medical experts ought not to hesitatein offering their valuable opinion on this matter. </p>    <p class="heading">(6)     Other Special Damages</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Having reviewed the evidence and the submissions of the parties on the matter, I award the sum of $18,000 as pre-trial medical expensesincurred by the plaintiff, the sum of $5,000 as travelling expenses (which was an agreed item), and the sum of $5,000 as pre-trialexpenses incurred on tonic food.  I do not make any award of damages for future medical expenses.
