References to its paragraphs will be made in parenthesis. No disqualification, penalty or other consequence, criminal orcivil, results from such determinations. Indeed, section 141A(2) expressly provides that No transaction shall be void or voidableby reason only that it is an insider dealing within the meaning of this part. Public obloquy is the only sanction; presumably onthe footing that the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation (Richard II).

They feel aggrieved to have been found parties to transactionssaid to be regarded by the legislature as dishonestâ (12.13) and stigmatised by a former Financial Secretary as "essentially fraudulentbehaviour" (2.49, 12.2). Whether or not the commercial community has hitherto adopted a hostile approach to insider dealers or demonstrateda lively appreciation of the existence or provisions of the Ordinance may be open to question (12.6). In <u>Sutton's Hospital Case</u><sup>(1)</sup> Sir Edward Coke said of corporations:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>They cannot commit treason, nor be outlawed, nor excommunicate, for they have no souls -</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>He might have been surprised to learn that by 1984 in this small but commercially vigorous part of Cathay they would have become capableof culpable insider dealing. At least two successful and influential men of business in good standing in Hong Kong were, it appears,indeed surprised so to learn (10.108, 10.116).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> "Culpable" in the context of the Ordinance and of culpable insider dealing means no more than "blameworthy" and, not being used inany unusual sense,</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">the meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law - It is for the tribunal which decides the case toconsider, not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinaryusage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>per Lord Reid in <u>Cozens</u> v <u>Brutus</u><sup>(2)</sup>. Section 141C(6) of the Ordinance so confirms. Right thinking members of society would not without more ado equate a determinationof culpability with a finding either of fraud or dishonesty. After reading the relevant report they might do so though not in thepresent instance where, as I would emphasise, the facts established are wholly inconsistent with such a finding in relation to anyapplicant save, possibly, C.W. Chow. Had the Tribunal so construed "culpable" as necessarily to require such a mental element itwould and could not have made the determinations it did save in relation to that one applicant and it is unfortunate if cursory readingof the Report has given rise to erroneous conclusions in this regard. Of the personal, as opposed to the corporate, applicants therewas no evidence that any save C. W. Chow was even aware of the material share-dealings (10.106). Nonetheless the implications forall the applicants of the determinations impugned are, beyond question, serious and far reaching. A finding of culpable insider dealingnecessarily predicates the purchase or sale of shares in circumstances where unfair advantage has been taken of other traders inthe securities market not possessed of relevant information. "Relevant information" is defined in section 141D(1) in relation tosecurities as</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p>- information which is not generally available but, if it were, would be likely to bring about a material change in the price of thosesecurities.</p>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Following a comment in the 1966 Report of the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry (Cmnd 3121) the Tribunal adopted for itself,as it made known to the applicants and their legal advisers in the course of oral hearings, a more rigorous standard of proof thanthe applicants could, as a matter of law, have demanded of them. We should find no dealing to be a culpable insider dealing for thepurposes of the Ordinance unless we were satisfied that it was established beyond doubt by the most cogent evidence -" (2.48, 2.52).As Lord Diplock explained in <u>Mahon</u> v <u>Air New Zealand</u><sup>(3)</sup>:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">The first rule is that the person making a finding in the exercise of such a jurisdiction must base his decision upon evidence thathas some probative value in the sense described below. - What is required by the first rule is that the decision to make the findingmust be based upon some material that tends logically to show the existence of facts consistent with the finding and that the reasoningsupportive of the finding, if it be disclosed, is not logically self-contradictory."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>The adoption of a higher standard, upon which the applicants must be deemed to have relied when deciding whether or not to seek adjournmentsor to adduce further evidence, can only have redounded to their advantage and was but one example of the Tribunal's conspicuous concernto act fairly in the conduct of its investigations.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In the absence of argument to the contrary I have no hesitation in making the necessary preliminary finding that, constituting asthey do an inquisitorial body with statutory duties to perform, the members of the Insider Dealing Tribunal of Hong Kong are amenableto the process of judicial review at the instance, at least, of persons affected by their determinations in circumstances where noalternative remedy exists. Review is not to be equated with an appeal. The High Court can only interfere if it be shown that in thedischarge of its statutory obligations the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, which is not suggested, in law, came to wholly unsupportableconclusions or acted unfairly. To concern itself with the merits of the determinations would be to usurp the Tribunalâs functions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Report owes its origin to a widely reported property transaction which took place during the currency of the Sino-British negotiationson the future of Hong Kong. By two documents, each dated 23rd January 1984, Zangforce Ltd. (Zangforce) a wholly owned subsidiaryof ICH, agreed to enter into formal contracts to sell to Cheery Bright Ltd. (Cheery Bright), the holding company for the Ever BrightGroup of companies, at stipulated prices exceeding $900 million in all, eight blocks of residential property at City Garden in HongKong. Cheery Bright paid Zangforce deposits amounting to some $94 million. The contracts were to be concluded before the expiry ofsix months but not earlier than 30th April unless, within that time, Cheery Bright had given Zangforce two days notice of cancellation.In that event the deposit or deposits as the case might be was or were to be repaid with interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum.The Tribunal found that at a time when he did not believe that the âbreak clauses would ever be invoked Mr. Wang, the chairmanof the Ever Bright Group who had come to Hong Kong in April 1983 from China, where he held a number of responsible posts, misrepresentedthe transaction to the public of Hong Kong as one of sale and purchase (1.11). The Tribunal nonetheless found that the transactionwas not merely a device to talk up the market by publicity for some improper ulterior motive (6.75). In relation to the motivationboth of Wang and K. S. Li it was a genuine business transaction. (5.59).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The projected sales became but a matter of history when, on 26th June, Cheery Bright gave Zangforce the necessary two days' notice.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> When the transaction first excited public attention there was, inevitably, a demand for the shares of ICH and the sales already mentioned(10.134) took place before its true nature became known to the public at large.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Section 141B of the Ordinance provides as follows:-</p>    <p>(1) Insider dealing in relation to the securities of a corporation takes place and, pursuant to section 141C, may be culpable forthe purposes of this Part -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="95%">when a dealing in the securities is made, procured or occasioned by a person connected with that corporation who is in possessionof relevant information concerning the securities;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="95%">when relevant information concerning the securities is disclosed by a person connected with that corporation, directly or indirectly,to another person and the first-mentioned person knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that the other person will make useof the information for the purpose of dealing, or procuring another to deal, in those securities.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>         (2) A dealing in the securities of a corporation is occasioned by a person connected with that corporation for the purposesof subsection (1)(a) when a person who has obtained relevant information in the circumstances described in subsection (1)(b) actuallymakes use of that information for the purpose of dealing, or procuring another to deal, in those securities.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Information about any anticipated or actual âbreak clausesâ certainly comes into the category of "relevant information".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Following, like the Tribunal, the pattern of the Ordinance it is appropriate first to consider whether the determination in relationto the admitted sales by Starpeace, procured by C.W. Chow, is susceptible to successful challenge. If it is, the determinations inrelation to the other applicants will not be sustainable as there would have been no insider dealing in which they could have beenfound involved pursuant to section 141H. If it is not so susceptible further matters will fall for consideration. No reliance wasplaced by the Tribunal when considering the possible culpability of C.W. Chow on knowledge derived from ICH Board Circular No. 3/84dated 7th February 1984 the last paragraph of which reads: -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="91%" class="quote">Directors are requested to note this transaction by signing at the appropriate spaces provided hereunder and keep the Special Condition- ("break clauses") - confidential as any leak would adversely affect the property market and the confidence in the economic revivalof Hong Kong."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> All hinges on the finding that C.W. Chow, who was a mature and trusted director of CKH and Starpeace, financial controller of theCKH Group, and a non-executive director of ICH and therefore connected with that company within the meaning of section 141E, wasaware of the âbreak clausesâ or the likelihood of âbreak clausesâ (10.23) by 16th January 1984 when the first of the materialsales of ICH shares took place (10.65); a finding from which it necessarily followed that he had lied to the Tribunal (10.86 and10.96). Nothing in the Report suggests that the Tribunal relied on mendacity as being probative of any substantive conclusion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It is contended that this finding in relation to the knowledge of C.W. Chow was made without affording him the opportunity of explanationor denial; an issue raised on the first day of the hearing before this Court and, with leave, added to the grounds of applicationby amendment. I turn again to Lord Diplockâs opinion in <u>Mahon</u> v <u>Air New Zealand</u> <sup>(3)</sup>:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="89%" class="quote">The second rule is that (the person making a finding) must listen fairly to any relevant evidence conflicting with the finding andany rational argument against the finding that a person represented at the inquiry, whose interests (including in that term careeror reputation) may be adversely affected by it, may wish to place before him or would have so wished if he had been aware of therisk of the finding being made. - The second rule requires that any person represented at the inquiry who will be adversely affectedby the decision to make the finding should not be left in the dark as to the risk of the finding being made and thus deprived ofany opportunity to adduce additional material of probative value which, had it been placed before the decision-maker, might havedeterred him from making the finding even though it cannot be predicted that it would inevitably have had that result."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>It had earlier been said by the English Court of Appeal in <u>Maxwell</u> v <u>Department of Trade</u> <sup>(4)</sup> that inspectors holding an inquiry under section 165 of the Companies Act 1948 were required to do no more than put to the witnessesthe substance of the evidence on the basis of which they were subsequently criticised in a report. They were not required to puttheir tentative conclusions to the witnesses for their comments or in order to allow further evidence to be adduced. As Lord DenningM.R. said at p.534 âThat would hold up the inquiry indefinitely.â</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>C.W. CHOW</u></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It is apparent from the terms of paragraph 5 of his statutory declaration made on 11th May 1985 that C.W. Chow, who had been warnedby letter from counsel for the Tribunal dated 25th April that consideration was being given to his possible implication in culpableinsider dealing, was well aware that any adverse finding would probably depend upon his knowledge of the âbreak clausesâ, orthe likelihood of âbreak clausesâ, before he had a sight of the ICH Board Circular. It was the first matter about which he wasexamined in chief by Mr. Wright, counsel instructed on behalf of all the applicants. In my opinion the cross-examination by Mr. Litton,leading counsel for the Tribunal, which followed and included express reference to policy changes as regards Starpeaceâs holdingsof ICH shares did nothing to dispel his reasonable apprehensions. When asked âBut you say it (the option to withdraw) was not knownto youâ he failed to answer. In written submissions respectively dated 31st August and 11th November, 1985, Mr. Litton contendedC.W. Chowâs possession of relevant information before 7th February 1984 is a matter of inference from the surrounding facts - andMr. Wright âThere is no direct evidence that Chow Chin-wo had knowledge of the option before he saw Board Circular No. 3/84. -There is no cogent evidence before the Tribunal to establish that C.W. Chow knew - â.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Wright went on to make the valid point, repeated before the Court, that it had never been put to C.W. Chow that either GeorgeZang or Albert Chow had informed him of the option or that he had learnt of it by overhearing such a conversation between them ashe had deposed to in his statutory declaration. There is no admission from either George Zang or Albert Chow that they told him.Mr. Wrightâs written submission also relates and, with reference to paragraphs 10.61 and 10.62 of the Report, it is to be observedthat C.W. Chow was not asked about any inquiry he might have made when he learnt of the deposits or about the circumstances in whichhe acquired knowledge of Wangâs wishes in relation to the circular. When finally addressing the Tribunal on 5th December 1985 Mr.Litton suggested more than once that if he said anything which occasioned surprise Mr. Wright could seek an adjournment to deal withit and sought to rebut any charge of procedural unfairness in the following terms:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="92%" class="quote">Ever since the receipt of those main submissions which I think was very early in the month of September this year they (the applicants)knew that is what they are alleged to have done and had they wanted to have further evidence before the Tribunal and any argumentthat they wished to address on the evidence - they had every opportunity of doing so and, indeed, were Mr. Wright to make an applicationnow to put further evidence to deal with that charge I dare say that the Tribunal will deal with it and entertain such applicationupon its merits."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>The Chairman agreed. I am not seeking to have these gentlemen recalled stated Mr. Wright in due course. In my opinion it was not thenincumbent upon the Tribunal to recall them.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The risk of a finding being made against him on the basis subsequently appearing in the Report was known to C.W. Chow throughout.He was not left in the dark or deprived of the opportunity to adduce additional material. Albeit he was not cross-examined on behalfof the Tribunal with the particularity which would have been appropriate to a âlis inter partesâ the substance of the materialevidence, as opposed to the Tribunalâs tentative conclusion, was put to him.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The inferential finding that C.W. Chow was aware of the âbreak clausesâ or the likelihood of âbreak clauses by 16th January1984 was based on a radical departure in the investment policy of Starpeace (10.88, 10.89, 10.90 and 10.91) and on his inevitableinterest in and need to know about and ability to ascertain details relating to the City Garden transaction of which he had learnt(10.25, 10.30 and 10.32). As from 23rd January, he was aware deposits had been paid. He was, it was remarked, financial controllerof the CKH Group responsible for dealing in ICH shares and expected to furnish information to auditors (10.54, 10.55, 10.57, 10.62and 10.65). Reliance was also placed by the Tribunal on C.W. Chowâs knowledge, prior to 7th February or thereabouts, that C. Y.Wang wanted the âbreak clausesâ kept secret (10.61).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> These primary facts constituted most cogent evidence from which the Tribunal, constituted to reflect commercial as well as legalknowledge and understanding, and applying its own high standard of proof, might âlogically and inevitablyâ draw, as it did, theinferences complained of. Such inferences are readily to be distinguished from conjecture or speculation. Accordingly, the Tribunalâsfinding that insider dealing in relation to the securities of ICH took place when C.W. Chow procured Starpeace to sell 55,634,000of that company's shares between 16th January and 1st March 1984, during the whole of which period he was in possession of ârelevantinformationâ concerning the securities, cannot be faulted as involving any error of law or unsupportable conclusion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="quote">            "The touchstone of culpability was held by the Tribunal to be âmaking use of relevant information in dealing in securities.â(2.10) Culpability âis a matter for the Tribunal to determine -â Sections 141B(1) and 141C(6). It is common ground that the dealingswere motivated by market considerations (10.68) so that sub-section (3) of section 141C, cannot be invoked any more than sub-sections(1), (4) and (5). In the course of an exhaustive analysis of the sales and purchases of ICH shares between 16th January and 31stDecember 1984 the Tribunal drew the further inference from the ârelevant informationâ which C.W. Chow had been found to possessthat âhe knew full well that he was dealing in ICH shares at a time when their price was unusually high and, for much of the timeuntil the 6th February, continuing to rise as a result of misinformation given to the public and he also knew that at any momentthere could be a material drop in the price of the shares if the truth about the negotiations for, and later the City Garden transactionwas made public - In such circumstances we were satisfied that in making his dealing decisions - C.W. Chow must have been motivatedby his knowledge that the unusually high price of ICH shares was unjustifiable - (10.9 and 10.98). On this footing he was found culpable(10.100 and 10.107). Again I can find no error of law or any conclusion or inference that can be stigmatised as unsupportable.</p>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Section 141H reads as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="9%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                -   (3)   The object of an inquiry shall be to determine, within the Tribunal's terms of reference -               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="21%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="82%" class="quote">                whether culpable insider dealing in relation to the securities of a corporation has taken place; and               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="21%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="82%" class="quote">the identity of the persons involved therein and the extent of their culpability.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="quote">         (4)    In making a determination under subsection (3)(b), the Tribunal shall not be limited to the identity and culpabilityof an immediate party to an insider dealing but may, subject to section 141C -</p>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="93%" class="quote">include any other person connected with the dealing;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="7%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="7%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="93%" class="quote">in the case of a body corporate, include the individuals who exercised control in the management thereof.â</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Sub-section (3)(b) requires the Tribunal to determine the extent of the culpability of persons found, like C.W. Chow, to have beeninvolved in culpable insider dealing. In other words the degree of blame to be attributed to a person so involved falls for determination.No grounds have been shown warranting any interference by this Court with the finding that C.W.

The relevantinformation known to C.W. Chow, one of its directors, and his use of it was to be imputed to Starpeace. The Tribunal found that herepresented its directing mind (10.20) and that the extent of its culpability was of the same high degree (10.108). In making thisdetermination the Tribunal accepted the proposition advanced by Mr. Wight in his written submissions that âthe acts and thought-processesof C.W. Chow are the acts and thought-processes of - Starpeace.â Very properly he did not seek to rely on any limitation upon C.W.Chowâs authority to deal. âBut a master - is liable even, for acts he has not authorised, provided they are so connected withacts which he has authorised that they may rightly be regarded as modes - although improper modes - of doing them.â Salmond onTorts 9th ed p.95 adopted by Lord Thankerton when giving the opinion of the Privy Council in <u>Canadian Pacific Railway Co.</u> v <u>Lockhart</u><sup>(5)</sup>. That this aspect of the law was well in the mind of the draftsman is apparent from the term of section 141C(2).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> There are no grounds which entitle the Court to interfere with the determinations in relation to this company. What has been saidabout fairness in relation to C.W. Chow applies, mutatis mutandis, to Starpeace which also received a separate warning letter dated25th April 1985.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>CHEUNG KONG (HOLDINGS) LTD.</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> By letter dated 23rd April 1985 CKH was warned that the Tribunal is inquiring into the possibility that the company may have beenimplicated in culpable insider dealing during the relevant period by reason of dealings in shares in International City HoldingsLtd. by your subsidiary companies during this period. Starpeace was a wholly owned subsidiary of CKH (10.15). If, as has been found,no complaint of unfairness can legitimately be made by C.W. Chow no such complaint can be made by CKH any more than by Starpeace.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In his statutory declaration C.W. Chow stated âMy authority to handle share dealings was given by Li Ka-shing verbally about 4or 5 years ago. This authority continues up to the present date -â He went on to mention the limitations on such authority as towhich what has been said in relation to Starpeace equally applies to CKH. C.W. Chow does not state on whose behalf Li Ka-shing gavehim authority, however. Nor does Li Ka-shing himself in his statutory declaration the material parts of which are in similar terms.To that extent paragraph 10.5 of the Report is literally inaccurate. But the inaccuracy is not material because in the course oftheir oral evidence C.W. Chow said he had been making acquisitions of ICH shares right through calendar years 1981, 1982 and 1983on behalf of CKH and Li Ka-shing that C.W. Chow could use any CM subsidiary he chose for share dealing. The implication that effectivelyC.W. Chow was acting for and on behalf of CKH is overwhelming. In any event Mr. Wright conceded in his written submissions that theacts and thought-processes of C.W. Chow are the acts and thought-processes of CKH (as well as of Starpeace) and if C.W. Chow is notculpable then likewise neither of these two companies is culpable. The converse must necessarily apply. The submissions continueC.W. Chow was the director who alone represented the directing mind and will of each company with respect to the dealings in ICHshares under consideration. This was not to say that what C.W. Chow knew as a director of Starpeace was ipso facto to be imputedto CKH because he was a director of that company also. The Tribunal was entitled, if it so wished, to accept such admissions, fromwhich no attempt was made to resile, without further inquiry and as or in substitution for the most cogent evidence. C.W. Chow forand on behalf of CKH and acting within the constraints described in paragraphs 3.4 and 10.16 of the Report procured Starpeace, whowere the beneficial owners of the shares, to enter into the material share dealings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> There are no grounds which entitle the Court to interfere with the determinations in relation to this company either (10.107 and10.108).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>THE OTHER DIRECTORS</u></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Of the applicant directors of CKH and Starpeace only C.W. Chow and George Magnus received letters warning them of the possibilityof personal culpability and Magnus was initially given to understand that the possibility of such culpability arose in the contextof a share-dealing as to which, in the event, no adverse determination was made. But it must have been apparent to K. S. Li, AlbertChow and George Zang, at the latest when Mr. Littonâs written submissions of 15th November 1985 were to hand, that they were andrisk. No real warning was given to Magnus until the oral hearing on 5th December when first the Chairman of the Tribunal and laterMr. Litton suggested that his position in law and in fact was no different from that of the others. The basis for possible personalculpability put to them was that they should have taken positive action if aware that a company of which they were directors mightengage in culpable insider dealing. Before the Tribunal turned to other matters the following exchanges took place between the Chairmanand Mr. Wright:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="19%" valign="top"><u>Chairman</u></td>            <td width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="79%" class="quote">I think Mr. Li Ka-shing for a start, and the others, have let him (C.W.

Thus, by the very end of the investigation into the relevantdealings each of the applicant directors, by his counsel, was aware that he might be found to have been involved in culpable insiderdealing, on the basis of undisputed evidence, as an individual who exercised control in the management of CKH and Starpeace. No applicationwas made for an adjournment or to call further evidence. Had a reasonable application been made, and it is difficult to think ofany further evidence that could have been relevant, I am quite satisfied that it would have been granted. In the premises these applicantscannot validly complain of procedural unfairness or irregularity or contend that any reasonable expectation was not met. The Tribunalhad not only apprised them of the risk of adverse determinations but gone so far as to put its tentative conclusions to them, bytheir counsel, for comment or to allow further evidence to be adduced.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Once a Tribunal has determined that culpable insider dealing has taken place, pursuant to the provisions of sections 141B, 141C(6)and 141H(3)(a), it is required, within its terms of reference, also to determine the identity of the persons involved therein andthe extent of their culpability. Section 141H(3)(b). And in making any such further determinations the Tribunal need not confineits attention to an immediate party to the insider dealing found culpable. It may determine that any other person, which includesa corporation, connected with such dealing was involved and, when that person is a corporation, that the individuals, which termexcludes corporations, who exercised control in its management were also involved. Put another way they may cast their net more widelythan is provided by section 141B. In any event the Tribunal has to undertake the further task of assessing the extent of the blameworthinessof any individual or corporation so identified. Section 14lH(4)(a) and (b).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In my view these provisions convey the salutary warning that individuals who at material times have exercised control in the managementof a corporation found party to culpable insider dealings, as had these directors, may, in the exercise of the Tribunalâs judgment,themselves be found involved and culpable. The words in relation to the dealing are conspicuously absent from subsection (b) of section141H(4). Directors, for example, cannot expect to escape adverse determinations under these provisions by delegating their powersof management to one of their number or to an employee as by the normal application of law and equity they might expect. In <u>Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co.</u><sup>(6)</sup>; <u>Huckerby</u> v <u>Elliott</u><sup>(7)</sup>. A director may be found culpable if he neglects to take reasonable steps to ensure that the law in relation to insider dealing isobserved by his company. A general direction to subordinates to comply with the law may not be sufficient. However, in the instantinquiry the Tribunal again adopted a higher standard; setting for itself the further test of personal involvement in the relevantculpable dealing (2.24 and 2.25). As in relation to the standard of proof this can only have redounded to the applicants' advantageand discloses neither that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question nor that it was guilty of any error of law of which the applicantscan complain. Subject to the element of discretion this is a very similar test to that applicable to directors and other officersin relation to offences under the Ordinance. Section 147(1).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Involvement, the Tribunal found, could arise when directors âwere implicated or concerned in events which led up to or inducedthe relevant dealing particularly where a situation had arisen where they were aware or ought to have been aware of a real risk thattheir company might embark on culpable insider dealing but they took no action to prevent such dealing.â (2.26). The action orrather inaction of the applicant directors at the material times was found, expressly or by inference, to render them involved andculpable (10.110).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In giving C.W. Chow his sole authority to deal in ICH shares on behalf of CKH, Starpeace and another subsidiary company, Wyncor Ltd.,K. S. Li had stipulated that no transaction was to contravene any ordinance or regulation. The culpable insider dealings were modestin relation to the size of the companies concerned and no motive of personal gain is ascribed to K. S. Li. Being possessed of ârelevantinformationâ at all material times he had also authorised the issue of Board Circular No. 3/84 which, in relation to the âbreakclausesâ, required secrecy rather than public disclosure. In that situation, the Tribunal declared, he should have given C.W. Chowdefinite instructions not to procure dealings in ICH shares (10.114) and have ensured that he understood the Ordinance (10.117).Li was to be regarded as culpable in the relevant dealings and culpable to a high degree accordingly (10.117). This determination,like those made in relation to the other directors, was essentially based on omissions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> George Zang and Albert Chow were found involved and appreciably culpable by reason of their ârelevant informationâ throughoutand of their knowledge both of the reactions of the market to the City Garden transaction and of C.W. Chow's authority and, beingso aware, of their failure to take steps to safeguard CKH and Starpeace from potential determinations of culpable insider dealing(10.120, 10.122 and 10.123).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> George Magnus was found involved and culpable to a modest but more than minimal degree in relation to the culpable insider dealingswhich took place between 20th February when, reading the Board Circular, he first became possessed of ârelevant informationâand 1st March 1984. This was on the basis that, being already aware that C.W. Chow was procuring Starpeace to deal in ICH shareshe, as from 20th February, failed to take steps to safeguard CKH and Starpeace from potential determinations of culpable insiderdealing (10.132 and 10.133).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Available to support the Tribunalâs findings of involvement, culpability and the extent of culpability, none of which were susceptibleto challenge on grounds of irrationality, was cogent evidence apt to satisfy its own stringent tests applicable to the directorsand, a fortiori, those required by the terms of the Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Each of the applications before the Court fails and must be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(M.
