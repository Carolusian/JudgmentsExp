The background of the case is as follows. The appellant, Mr. Mohammed Yaqub Khan, was a member of the KowloonCricket Club. On two dates in July 1980 he made anonymous allegations to the Independent Commission Against Corruption of corruptionby the Manager and Officers and Members of the Committee of the Club. The telephone calls were recorded on tape and investigationsbegan. A short time later officers of the ICAC played over the tape to a number of persons including those about whom allegationshad been made and the informer's identity, that is the appellant's identity, thus became known and he was subsequently expelled fromthe Club in October 1980. He issued his writ in the District Court against the Attorney General, endorsed with Particulars of Claim,on the 19th February 1982. These set out the facts and aver that in the circumstances the disclosure Of Mr. Khan's identity was abreach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Bribery Ordinance</a> - <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201">Cap. 201</a> ("the Ordinance"). Paragraph e of the Particulars of Claim was in the following terms -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="35%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"8    </p>            </td>            <td width="65%" valign="top" class="quote">By reason of the breach of statutory duty aforesaid, the Plaintiff suffered loss and damage as follows: he suffered injury to feelingsin the form of, inter alia, worry, strain, anxiety, annoyance, unhappiness and embarrassment. His reputation suffered. On or about19th October, 1980, he was expelled from the KCC of which he had at all material times been a member."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>Damages are claimed against the Attorney General and he is sued by virtue of the Croon Proceedings ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap. 300</a>).</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It seems that Mr. Khan later sought an Order for discovery and inspection of the files of the ICAC relating to the investigationand that the application was dismissed by another District Judge. Mr. Khan appealed to this Court and, we understand, the hearingof the appeal was adjourned pending the determination of a preliminary point of law which by agreement was later formulated as follows-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Does a breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Bribery Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201">Cap. 201</a>, in the manner alleged in the Particulars of Claim, afford a cause of action to the Plaintiff?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Judge Wong answered this question in the negative; hence this appeal. It should perhaps here be mentioned that the matter proceededbefore the Judge on the assumption (which Mr. Peter Graham for the Attorney General did not concede) that the disclosure, in theterms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Ordinance, had been made "without lawful authority or reasonable excuse", and for the purposes of the preliminary issue, Mr.Graham conceded that Mr. Khan's identity was a "detail" of the "investigation" within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> This is what <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30</a> of the Ordinance says -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="18%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="11%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote">"30.

On the assumption that a detail of the investigationhad been disclosed without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, there had clearly been a breach of the provisions of the section.He came to the conclusion on the authorities which were referred to him and which he dealt with at considerable length in his judgmentthat while <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> was intended to, prevent any harm that disclosure might bring about, Mr. Khan did not belong to. the class of persons which its provisionssought to protect, thereby giving him a cause of action in the event of a breach.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In my judgment Judge Wong was clearly right in concluding that the primary purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> is to protect the confidentiality and efficacy of the investigation and thus it prohibits unauthorised disclosure to the person underinvestigation that he is under investigation and any details of such investigation. Obviously such knowledge would enable the personconcerned, if he were so minded, to abscond, tamper with the evidence or otherwise attempt to frustrate the investigation. The secondpart of subsection (1) seems to me to have two aims. Information passed on to another concerning the identity of the person underinvestigation or any details of the investigation (including, I am prepared to accept for the purposes of argument, the means ofidentifying the informer) might come to the ears of the "suspect" and prejudice the investigation; and so the primary purpose of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.30</a> is thereby still advanced. However, particularly when regard is had. to subsection (2) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a>, it seems clear to me that the section is also designed to protect the reputation of the person under investigation unless and untilone or other of the events specified in subsection (2) has occurred. I remark here, without deciding the point of course, that aperson who is informed against might well have a right of action for a breach of statutory duty if his identity is revealed in circumstancesnot justified by subsection (2).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I have no doubt that Mr. Khan did not come within measurable distance of establishing that on the true construction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a>, in the context of the Ordinance as a whole, the duty of confidentiality was imposed for a specific category of persons of whichhe was a member - see <u>Leung Chow Public Car Company</u> v. <u>The Attorney General</u>, Privy Council Appeal No. 30 of 1981 and <u>Lonrho 1td</u> v. <u>Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd</u>. (No. 2) <em>[</em>1982<em>]</em> A.C. 173, two cases referred to by the Judge in his judgment. Mr. Khan certainly falls in the category of persons afforded a certainmeasure of protection under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Ordinance. On the authorities, therefore, I do not think he had any cause of action and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(K.T.

P,</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I too would dismiss the appeal. What falls for decision here is a question of law which may be paraphrased in the following words:"Does disclosure of information contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Bribery Ordinance</a> afford a cause of action to a .member of the public who supplies. information to the ICAC and who is adversely affected by the disclosure.I such a person one with a aright to enforce the duty created by that section? From <u>Cutler</u> v. <u>Wands orth Standium Ltd.</u> <em>[</em>1949<em>]</em> A.C 398, a case which was cited by the trial Judge, it appears that the proper approach is to see whether or not on the true constructionof the statute as a whole, a right of action by an individual aggrieved by the breach of one of the statutory duties imposed, oughtto be implied. The matter resolves itself into the question. For whose benefit was the duty imposed? This question was most carefullyconsidered by the trial Judge, all the relevant authorities were examined by him and I am quite satisfied that he was correct whenhe concluded that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> was enacted in the general interests of the public to safeguard the confidentiality of ICAC investigations, and that it was not,in my view, intended by the legislature to give rise to any private liability. I am quite satisfied that it was certainly not intendedto impose liability towards a person giving information to the ICAC. I would therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(P.F.X.

With everyrespect to him I do not myself find assistance in that approach. I prefer to start with the general test laid down by Lord Simondsin <u>Cutler</u> v. <u>Wandsworth Stadium Ltd.</u> <em>[</em>1949<em>]</em> A.C. 398 at p.407 and quoted by the learned District Judge below:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"'Where an Act' (I cite from the judgment of Lord Tenterden,C.J. in <u>Doe</u> v. <u>Bridges</u>) 'creates an obligation, and enforces the performance in a specified manner, we take it to be a general rule that performance cannotbe enforced in any other manner'. This passage was cited with approval by the Earl of Halsbury, L.C. in <u>Passmore</u> v. <u>Oswa1twistle Urban District Council</u>. But this general rule is subject to exceptions. It may be that, though a specific remedy is provided by the Act, yet the personinjured has a personal right of action in addition.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <blockquote>                            <blockquote>                                <blockquote>                                    <p class="quote"> </p>                                </blockquote>                            </blockquote>                        </blockquote>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The exceptions were elaborated by Lord Diplock in <u>Lonrho Ltd</u>. v. <u>Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.</u>  (No. 2) <em>[</em>1982<em>]</em> A.C. 173 at p.185 and again quoted by the judge below:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The first is where upon the true construction of the Act it is apparent that the obligation or prohibition was imposed for the benefitor protection of a particular class of individuals, as in the case of the Factories Acts and similar legislation .... The secondexception is where the statute creates a public right (i..e. a right to be enjoyed by all those of Her Majesty's subjects who wishto avail themselves of it) and a particular member of the public suffers what Brett J. in <u>Benjamin</u> v. <u>Storr</u> (1874) L.R.9 C.P. 400, 407, described as "particular, direct, and substantial" damage "other and different from that which was commonto all the rest of the public." Most of the authorities about this second exception deal not with public rights created by statutebut with public rights existing at common law, particularly in respect of use of highways."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <blockquote>                            <blockquote>                                <blockquote>                                    <p> </p>                                </blockquote>                            </blockquote>                        </blockquote>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Where the right is alleged to be created by statute, the Lord Justice had this further to add (at p.186) "... it has first to beshown that the statute, having regard to its scope and language, does fall within that class of statute which creates a legal rightto be enjoyed by all Her Majesty's subjects who wish to avail themselves of it."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Now it is to my mind abundantly clear that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> does not create any legal rights at all, whether for the benefit or protection of a particular class of individuals or for the publicin general. Its purpose is to regulate the investigation of bribery and corruption in much the same way as in <u>Cutler</u> v. <u>Wandsworth Stadium</u>, the Betting Act of 1934 was to regulate betting at race tracks. I do not find it possible to read into s.30 a particular intentionto benefit or protect persons who might choose to telephone anonymous suspicions to the office of the ICAC. The protection of theiridentity, if it is to be protected at all, is to be found in s.30A. Section 30 is intended to preserve the confidentiality of theinvestigation itself, to see that it is not hampered by the premature disclosure of with whom, or what, it is concerned. That isin substance the view taken by the learned Judge below. In my judgment his decision was clearly right.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.
