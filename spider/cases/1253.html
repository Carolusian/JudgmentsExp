The matter before the judge was a claim by the plaintiffas the developer under one of the Private Sector Participation Schemes (âPSPSâ).  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appealjudgment was reserved which we now give.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The background to the PSPS scheme and its implementation has been fully set out in the judgment below and there is no need to repeatit here.  No issue has been taken on any of the facts set out therein.  For the purposes of this appeal it suffices to say that inApril 1996 the plaintiff, which is a subsidiary of a large group, entered a contract with the Government.  That contract is encapsulatedin Conditions of Sale for the grant of land for development as part of the PSPS projects.  The terms of the contract with the Governmentrequire the plaintiff to develop the site into both residential housing and commercial premises.  There were two phases.  In thefirst phase there were to be 2648 residential housing units and in the second phase there were to be 1260 units.  The developmentwas known as Charming Garden.  This case is not concerned with the commercial part of the development.  In respect of the housingunits there were special provisions which were similar to other PSPS schemes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The intent behind the PSPS scheme was that the housing units would be sold at less than the market price for units of that typeto applicants who would be nominated by the defendant.  Although the PSPS scheme would provide housing at a reduced cost to the applicants,successful applicants were required to retain their units for a number of years and were not allowed to sell them on unless theypaid an extra amount for the privilege.  The effect of clause 26 of the Special Conditions of the Conditions of Sale was that theplaintiff was required to sell the units at a price which was to be determined by the defendant with a deposit varying between 5%and 10%, again to be directed by the defendant, but that the plaintiff would only receive $15,000 per square metre of total saleablearea.  Any excess in the sale price over that figure would go to the defendant and any shortfall in the sale price would be madeup by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Under clause 24 of the Special Conditions the defendant was required to nominate the persons to whom each unit would be sold.  Sub-clause(24)<i>(a)</i>(ii)I provided that, if the person nominated did not sign a sale and purchase agreement, the plaintiff was required to inform thedefendant who would then nominate another person to purchase the unit.  Sub-clause (24)<i>(a)</i>(ii)II provided for circumstances where a nominated person had signed the sale and purchase agreement but did not pay the balanceof the purchase price.  The provisions of that sub-clause together with the salient parts of sub-clause (24)<i>(b)</i> are relevant for the purposes of this case and are set out as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">(24)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(a)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(ii)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">Within the period of 12 months specified in sub-clause (<i>a</i>)(i) of this Special Condition, if a nomination in respect of a unit shall have been made by the Hong Kong Housing Authority, butthe home-owner :- </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">â¦â¦â¦.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">II.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="79%" valign="top" class="quote">having paid the deposit, fails to pay the balance of the purchase price for the unit by the time specified for payment in the agreementfor sale and purchase (the time for payment being due within the said period of 12 months), the Purchaser shall inform the Directorof Housing thereof by notice in writing within 14 days of such failure whereupon the Hong Kong Housing Authority acting through theDirector of Housing shall within four calendar months of such notification nominate another home-owner to purchase the unit in questionand shall specify the purchase price at which such unit shall be purchased by the home-owner and in such event the Purchaser shallonly be entitled to an amount equal to the purchase price (less the deposit paid by the original home-owner) which would have beenpayable by the original home-owner had the failure not taken place.  </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:center" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">â¦â¦â¦.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(b)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="3">After the expiry of the period of 12 months specified in sub-clause <i>(a)</i>(i) of this Special Condition, the Purchaser (<i>i.e. the plaintiff)</i> shall inform the Director of Housing by notice in writing of :- </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(i)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">any unit in respect of which no nomination in accordance with sub-clause <i>(a)</i>(i) of this Special Condition shall have been made by the Hong Kong Housing Authority acting through the Director of Housing, within28 days after the expiry of the said period of 12 months;

The Director of Housing wouldthen nominate another home-owner to purchase the unit in respect of which the agreement for sale and purchase has been rescindedat whatever price was considered appropriate and the plaintiff would only be entitled to an amount equal to the purchase price (lessthe deposit paid by the original home-owner) which would have been payable for the unit by the original home-owner had the rescissionnot taken place.  Again if there was no new nomination the defendant would purchase the unit at the price which would have been payableby the original home-owner had the rescission not taken place less the deposit paid by the original home-owner.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  From these provisions it is quite clear that if a nominated person had paid a deposit then either there would be a successful re-nominationof another person to purchase the unit or the defendant itself would purchase the unit.  In either case the plaintiff would be entitledto the $15,000 per square metre but would have to take into account any deposit which had been paid and forfeited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In practice what happened is that the defendant required a nomination fee from a home-owner.  That fee would be either 5% or 10%of the price of the unit.  That fee was then treated as being the deposit under the agreement that would be signed by the home-ownerwith the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the present case the defendant had determined the original sale price of the units to be $40,000 per square metre.  At an administrativemeeting on 26 June 1997 it was agreed that when the deposits were paid the amounts would be divided between the plaintiff and thedefendant in the ratio of 15/40.  The amount that the plaintiff received would then be taken into account in the reckoning, whenall the units had been sold.  Altogether there were 3908 nominations and 3488 agreements for sale and purchase were executed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Before completion took place there was a well documented downturn in the economy which has been commonly referred to as the Asianfinancial crisis.  The net effect was that the open market value of equivalent units dropped to such an extent that home-owners becameless inclined to consider their nomination a valuable asset.  Coupled with that there were various changes in government policy inrelation to housing which made it understandable that home-owners might wish not to complete the purchase of the units in respectof which they had been nominated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Although there were claims in respect of other home-owners, the claim that was extant on this appeal was in respect of 946 home-owners. They had entered agreements for the sale and purchase of units as home-owners and had paid their deposits but then expressed theirwish not to complete the transactions.  In respect of some of them they received letters from the defendant informing them that theirrequest to withdraw from the sale and purchase agreement was approved and that their application had been cancelled, but in respectof all these 946 home-owners the plaintiff itself entered cancellation agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is said on behalf of the plaintiff that it did so because it was a matter of <i>fait accompli</i> that the purchasers had already secured the agreement of the defendant that they could cancel their sale and purchase agreements. In respect of most of those 946 home-owners the deposit of at least 5% was forfeited.  There were some who, for one reason or another,the defendant permitted the nomination fee to be returned.  In respect of all those units the defendant either successfully nominateda new person to purchase the units or, in respect of some of the units, purchased them itself.  In summary the plaintiff did receive$15,000 per square metre in respect of all the units.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The claim in this action was on the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to the whole of the deposit in respect of each of the946 units in addition to the $15,000 per square metre which it has already received.  In the course of argument it was made clearthat the claim was in respect of the whole of all deposits, irrespective of whether the whole of the amount originally paid as nominationfee had been returned to the home-owner and irrespective of the 15/40 split that had been the subject of the administrative meetingdiscussion on 26 June 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The plaintiffâs claim to the deposits in addition to the amount of $15,000 per square metre under the contract was first madein a letter dated 15 April 1998 from the plaintiffâs parent company to the defendant.  It is clear that the plaintiff and its parentwere well aware that there was a difference of opinion as to that claim.  In their letter dated 13 May 1998 to the defendant, theplaintiffâs solicitors referred to the difference in views between the two parties and were content that the matter should be sortedout later.  Two days later the defendant replied saying that the forfeited deposits would be dealt with in accordance with the termsof the government grant.  When the plaintiffâs solicitors pursued the matter again the Housing Department wrote on 22 June 1998that the matter should be dealt with in the final account upon the completion of the projects under the terms of the Grants and theconfirmed minutes of the conveyancing meeting held on 26 June 1997 and notes of the conveyancing arrangement in respect of phase2 of Charming Garden dated 16 October 1997.  The relevant part of those minutes and notes read:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">In any case of rescission, the total amount receivable by the developer as listed in Appendix G would remain unchanged, that is thedeveloper would not have any share on the money forfeited from nomination fees/deposits already paid by the nominees in cases ofrecession.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The judge below considered that the matter was covered by sub-clause 24(<i>a</i>)(ii)II or in the alternative 24(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the Special Conditions.  In a lengthy judgment in which the arguments of both sides were fully set out, the judge held inthe defendantâs favour and considered that the matter was covered by those 2 provisions and also that, in effect, the plaintiffand the defendant had contracted the time before the defendant could nominate replacement home-owners to take over the units thatthe original nominees no longer wished to purchase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On this appeal Mr Chan SC, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in this court, argued first of all that special condition 24(<i>a</i>)(ii)II did not apply in this instance because it only applied where the home-owner failed to pay the balance by the time specifiedin the sale and purchase agreement.  His argument was that there was no time specified because clause 1 of the cancellation agreementsprovided that the sale and purchase agreements were âcancelled and shall be deemed to be null and void and of no further effectâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In my view the judgeâs approach was entirely correct.  The short answer must be that the various purchasers (home-owners) whosigned sale and purchase agreements did not complete the purchases and pay the balance of the purchase price for the units by thetime specified in the agreements irrespective of whether or not those agreements had been cancelled.  As the judge below correctlysaid, it is as though the cancellation agreements cut short the time which was required for the plaintiff to wait for the failureto take place and accepted that it never would take place.  That way all parties were benefited because the plaintiff and the defendantwould be put in a position whereby they could accelerate the subsequent nomination of new home-owners for the units, no doubt atprices which were by then acceptable to those who would be interested.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The argument that the original sale and purchase agreements were of no effect could not, it seems to me, assist the plaintiff becausethe amounts which were deemed to satisfy the requirement for the deposits had in fact been paid to the defendant as nomination fees. They were then treated by the parties as being the deposits.  If the sale and purchase agreements were truly of no effect whateverthose payments were they would not be deposits, because on the plaintiffâs argument there was no requirement for there to be anydeposit, but they would be the nomination fees.  The plaintiff cannot rely simply on clause 2 of the cancellation agreements whichprovided that âUpon cancellation of the said Agreement, the parties agree that the Vendor shall be entitled to forfeit the saiddepositâ.  If the money was paid as a nomination fee payable to a first party and was notionally allocated in satisfaction of arequirement for a deposit under an agreement between 2 other parties, those other 2 parties cannot agree amongst themselves thatthey will cancel their agreement, and arrange that one of them will pocket the nomination money on the basis that their agreementno longer existed.  That would be a fraud on the first party.  In those circumstances it would be the first party, in this case thedefendant, that would be entitled to that money.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I would add that Mr Chan argued the minutes of the conveyancing meeting held on 26 June 1997 were irrelevant because what was saidonly applied in cases of rescission and these were cases of cancellation.  Semantically that argument may be correct, but I havelittle doubt that what was intended was to cover a situation such as the present where the sale and purchase agreements were notcarried out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  There was a subsidiary argument in respect of 28 home-owners that there was a wrongful interference with contract namely the saleand purchase agreements.  The judge below dismissed the claim on the basis that the home-owners had not breached their contractsbecause the option to forfeit deposits was an alternative open to them under the contract.  Whilst I would not dissent from thatI consider that any such claim must be fundamentally unsound because the plaintiff cannot demonstrate that it has suffered any damage. The plaintiff was only entitled to $15,000 per square metre and that it received whether the units were purchased by nominated home-ownersor by the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I have no hesitation in saying that this appeal should be dismissed.  It not only fails on the argument but also lacks any semblanceof merit.  I would make an order <i>nisi</i> of costs in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I agree with the judgment of Rogers VP.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Reyes J:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">I. INTRODUCTION</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  There are 2 main issues. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The first is whether Oriental Sharp is entitled to receive more than the guaranteed sum under the Conditions of Sale (that is, $15,000per sq. m. times total saleable area).  Here it is accepted that (despite reference therein to âthe Governmentâ instead of theHousing Authority) special conditions 24 and 26 of the Conditions of Sale constitute a contract between the Housing Authority andOriental Sharp.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The second is whether the Housing Authority wrongfully induced 28 of 946 original purchasers to breach their sale and purchase agreementswith Oriental Sharp.  Here it is accepted that the Housing Authority was not a party to the pertinent sale and purchase agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II. DISCUSSION</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>A. Issue 1:  Whether entitlement to more than guaranteed sum</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>A.1 Formulations of the issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The parties have treated this issue as an argument over Oriental Sharpâs entitlement to the deposits forfeited by the 946 originalpurchasers who failed to pay the balance of the price for their units.  But, for reasons which I explain below, I prefer my formulationof the issue.  Ultimately, I do not think that the difference in formulation affects the outcome on this issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I prefer my formulation because it makes plain that there is no dispute that Oriental Sharp is at least entitled to the guaranteedsum.  The Housing Authority is not contending, for example, that Oriental Sharp is only entitled to the guaranteed sum less any initialdeposit paid.  On the contrary, the Housing Authority has paid Oriental Sharp the guaranteed sum.  But Oriental Sharp claims to beentitled to more.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The controversy arises because, the 946 original purchasers having defaulted, the Housing Authority either nominated new purchasersor itself to replace the original purchasers. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  When the new purchasers or the Housing Authority bought the 946 units over which there had been default, they did so at a reducedprice from that payable by the original purchasers.  But in accordance with the Conditions of Sale the Housing Authority ensuredthat Oriental Sharp received the guaranteed sum which was not affected by the reduction in the purchase price. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  However, in paying the guaranteed sum, the Housing Authority took account of the fact that Oriental Sharp had received initial depositsfrom the 946 defaulting original purchasers.  The Housing Authority therefore only topped up to the extent of the guaranteed sumless the initial deposits received by Oriental Sharp from the 946 defaulting original purchasers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  By these proceedings, Oriental Sharp essentially claims that the Housing Authority was wrong to have so acted.  Instead (accordingto Oriental Sharp) the Housing Authority should have paid the whole of the guaranteed sum without deducting the amount of the depositspaid by the 946 original purchasers.  It was wrong for the Housing Authority to take account of these initial deposits (OrientalSharp says) because they constituted compensation for the interest and other financial charges which Oriental Sharp had to bear byreason of the delayed payment of the purchase price for the 946 defaulting units.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The answer to the first issue hinges on whether special condition 24(a)(ii)II of the Conditions of Sale governs the treatment ofthe deposits paid by the 946 defaulting original purchasers. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  This is because sc. 24(a)(ii)II states that, where (having paid a deposit) an original purchaser âfails to pay the balance ofthe purchase price for the unit by the time specified in the agreement for sale and purchase,â Oriental Sharp is only entitledto âan amount equal to the purchase price (less the deposit paid by the original [purchaser]) which would have been payable bythe original [purchaser] had the failure not taken placeâ.  By the special condition, Oriental Sharp has no entitlement to anotherdeposit from a new purchaser in respect of a unit for which an original purchaser has already paid a deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Accordingly, if sc. 24(a)(ii)II governs, in the case of the 946 units on which the original purchasers defaulted, Oriental Sharpcan only be entitled to receive the corresponding portion of the guaranteed sum from the Housing Authority, no more, no less.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Andrew Cheung J answered the question of the application of sc. 24(a)(ii)II in the affirmative.  For the reasons which I set outin the next section, I respectfully agree with him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>A.2 Application of sc. 24(a)(ii)II</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Merely on a reading of its plain and ordinary meaning, sc. 24(a)(ii)II applies here.  The 946 original purchasers self-evidentlyâfailed to pay the balance of the purchase price by the time specifiedâ in their respective agreements for sale and purchase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  But Edward Chan SC (appearing for Oriental Sharp) submits that this straightforward reading of sc. 24(a)(ii)II is erroneous.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr. Chan points out that the 946 original purchasers entered into cancellation agreements with Oriental Sharp prior to the timespecified for completion in the various sale and purchase agreements.  In each case, the cancellation agreements stipulated thatthe corresponding sale agreements previously entered into between an original purchaser and Oriental Sharp were âcancelledâ andâdeemed to be null and void and of no further effectâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The result (Mr Chan argues) is that the agreements for sale and purchase ceased to specify a time for the payment of the balanceof the purchase price.  No time for completion being any longer specified in the cancelled agreements for sale and purchase, sc.24(a)(ii)II cannot (Mr. Chan reasons) be applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The entry into cancellation agreements by the 946 original purchasers (Mr. Chan submits) was something that was not envisaged bythe persons who drafted the Conditions of Sale. If the Conditions do not deal with the situation, Oriental Sharp must be entitledto retain for itself (rather than account to the Housing Authority for) the deposits paid to it by the 946 original purchasers beforetheir agreements were cancelled.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  I am not persuaded by Mr. Chan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  First, the Housing Authority and Oriental Sharp (acting by its solicitors) expressly agreed in correspondence that the cancellationagreements were to be executed without prejudice to the partiesâ respective rights and entitlement under the Conditions of Sale. Thus, it is neither permissible nor proper to treat the cancellation agreements as in any way affecting the Conditions of Sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Second, in any case, as a matter of principle, the cancellation agreements (to which the Housing Authority was not a party) cannotaffect the construction or ambit of the expression âby the time specified in the agreement for sale and purchaseâ in the Conditionsof Sale (to which the original purchasers who entered into the cancellation agreements were not a party).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  To put it starkly, assume that A enters into contract X with B.  B later executes contract Y with C to the effect that an expressionin contract X is to be regarded as null and void and of no effect as far as B and C are concerned.  I do not see how contract Y canaffect the construction or ambit of the relevant expression in contract X as far as A and B are concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Mr. Chan attempts to get around this difficulty by noting that a copy of the cancellation agreement was shown to the Housing Authorityprior to execution of the same by the 946 defaulting original purchasers.  The Housing Authority (it is said) made no comment on(and therefore must have implicitly approved) the draft shown.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  That may have been what happened.  But I do not see how such fact can have any bearing on the problem. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Merely because the Housing Authority was aware of Oriental Sharpâs cancellation agreement would not somehow make the Housing Authoritya party to such contract. This must especially be so where it was agreed among all concerned that the cancellation agreements wereto be without prejudice to the partiesâ rights under the Conditions of Sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Third, in any event, the fact that, by a cancellation agreement, it was agreed that a corresponding sale and purchase agreementwould be nullified, cannot alter the hard reality that the (now cancelled) agreement literally continues to specify a time for completion. Whether or not legally obliged to complete by such specified time after signing a cancellation agreement, the original purchaserstill âfails to pay the balance of the purchase price ... by the time specifiedâ within the terms of sc. 24(a)(ii)II. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I do not think that it is here relevant for ascertaining whether a payment has been (or has failed to be) made at a specified timethat an original purchaser is, due to subsequent events, no longer obliged to complete by such time. Special Condition 24(a)(ii)IIsays nothing about an original purchaser failing to pay contrary to a subsisting legal obligation.  It only refers to the originalpurchaserâs failure to pay.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I therefore conclude that sc. 24(a)(ii)II governs the situation of the 946 original purchasers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  By way of fallback, Mr. Chan argues that Oriental Sharp is at least entitled to an apportionment of forfeited deposit under sc.26(c). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The latter term concerns the situation where the Government unilaterally varies the sale price of a housing unit. In such case,a developer like Oriental Sharp would be entitled to a top up from the Housing Authority where the new sale price results in lessthan the guaranteed sum being received by Oriental Sharp.  But if the new sale price leads to the developer receiving more than theguaranteed sum, the excess must be paid over to the Housing Authority. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  As far as I can see, there is nothing in sc. 26(c) to justify a general apportionment of deposit along the lines suggested by Mr.Chan.  If anything, sc. 26(c) confirms Cheung Jâs view that under the Conditions of Sale Oriental Sharp is entitled to no morethan the guaranteed sum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>B. Issue 2: Whether interference with sale and purchase agreement</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Cheung J rejected Oriental Sharpâs contention on wrongful interference on 2 principal bases.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  First, there was a problem of causation.  Cheung J was not persuaded that Oriental Sharp had established a causative link betweenany act of the Housing Authority that could be characterised as wrongful and the default of an original purchaser. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In the case of a majority of the 946 original purchasers, there was no evidence that they had opted to withdraw from completiondue to any specific conduct by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On the other hand, some 28 of the 946 original purchasers became entitled to a refund of their deposit as a result of a change inhousing policy due to the recession in the property market.  This entitlement to a refund (Cheung J thought) could have played apart in the decision of these few purchasers not to complete.  But (Cheung J observed at Â§225) âthe Housing Authority was andis fully entitled to announce whatever new policy relating to housing it sees fit to pursueâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr. Chan does not seek to overturn Cheung Jâs finding of an absence of causation in the case of the majority of purchasers.  Mr.Chan limits his criticism to the situation of the few who became entitled to a refund of their deposit. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The Housing Authority may have been able to adopt whatever policy it deemed appropriate.  But (Mr. Chan argues) that change of policyencouraged 28 purchasers to default on their obligations to Oriental Sharp.  That change in policy (Mr. Chan suggests) was accordinglyâwrongful interferenceâ under tort law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I disagree with Mr. Chan.  I fail to see how there can be something âwrongfulâ (in whatever sense) in the Housing Authoritychanging its policy in response to economic conditions in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Second, Cheung J found that, on a true construction in their factual matrix, the sale and purchase agreements provided for alternativemodes of performance on the part of a purchaser. Having paid a deposit, the latter could either pay the balance of the purchase priceor forfeit the deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In opting not to pay the balance of the price, the 946 purchasers were not (Cheung J reasoned) breaching their sale and purchaseagreements otherwise than in a technical sense. They were instead merely taking an alternative to completion (namely, forfeitureof their deposit) which was contractually open to them.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The situation (Cheung J held) was akin to that in <u>Wong Lai-fan v. Lee Ha</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKLR 125</a> where the Court of Appeal held that under the relevant contract the purchaser could either proceed to completion or opt to pay aâdouble compensationâ for failing to complete.  Specific performance could not be ordered in such case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Given the lack of causation and wrongful interferernce mentioned above, it is unnecessary for me to assess this second basis.  Imerely record here for completeness that I am inclined to agree with Cheung Jâs approach and conclusion on this point. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">III. CONCLUSION</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Oriental Sharp fails on both issues.
