The Plaintiff (â<b>Pioneer</b>â) is the owner of the residential unit allegedly damaged as a result of the renovation work carried out in the Defendant (â<b>Redhill</b>â)âs unit immediately above in July 2008.  Pioneer claimed damages against Redhill.  Redhill has subsequently met Pioneerâsclaim on a without admission basis.  Now parties cannot agree on how to properly dispose of this action and the issue of the costsof this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Before this court are 2 summonses, both taken out by Redhill with a view to having this action dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Background</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Upon Pioneerâs complaint in July 2008, Redhill inspected Pioneerâs unit.  Pioneer then appointed its surveyor to inspect thedamage.  A survey report was produced in September 2008, which was sent to Redhillâs representative, Swire Properties ManagementLimited.  Letter of demand was sent to Redhill in December 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 9 April 2009, Pioneer commenced this action against Redhill claiming damages in the sum of HK$57,000 or to be assessed.  Theclaim was based on alleged negligence in the carrying out of the work in Redhillâs unit.  However, Redhill denied liability arisingout of the manner in which its independent contractor carried out the work.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 13 May 2009, Pioneer amended its claim by adding the causes of action in the tort of nuisance and breach of the deed of mutualcovenant (â<b>DMC</b>â).  Redhill then pointed out the arbitration clause in the DMC and suggested that any dispute as to breach of the DMC should bereferred to arbitration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Pioneer invited Redhill to consent to resolving the dispute in respect of all the causes of action, including the breach of theDMC, in this action.  Redhill refused and reiterated its readiness and willingness to do all things necessary for the conduct ofarbitration.  It invited Pioneer to discontinue this action altogether so that the dispute could be resolved entirely by way of arbitration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 27 May 2009, Pioneer gave notice to Redhill of its withdrawal of the cause of action for breach of the DMC from this action witha view to referring the same to arbitration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 3 June 2009, Redhill pointed out that in respect of the same incident and the same relief claimed, Pioneer would effectivelybe pursuing its claim by way of parallel sets of proceedings.  Redhill considered that this would be improper and duplicity of process.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Nevertheless, Redhill filed the Defence on 10 June 2009.  Pioneerâs Amended Reply was filed 2 weeks later.  Pleadings were closedon 9 July 2009.  Discovery of documents began.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In the meantime, Pioneer took steps in preparing for arbitration through the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (â<b>HKIAC</b>â).  Correspondence between the HKIAC and Swire also endured regarding the appointment of the arbitrator.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In September 2009, through Swire, Redhill represented to the HKIAC that in view of the preparation already done in this action bythen, it was likely that the trial of this action would be set down and concluded shortly.  Redhill took the view that if Pioneersucceeded in this action, the arbitration would become redundant.  Redhill therefore repeatedly requested to put the appointmentof the arbitrator on hold pending the outcome of this action.  Nevertheless, the arbitrator was appointed by the end of September2009.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 2 October 2009, Redhill took out a summons seeking to dismiss this action on the ground that Pioneer has failed to file a timetablingquestionnaire and to take out a case management summons pursuant to O.25 of the Rules of the District Court (â<b>the O.25 summons</b>â).  This became the first summons now before this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  A week later, Pioneer served the timetabling questionnaire and invited Redhill to withdraw the O.25 summons.  It also expressedits intention to join Redhillâs contractor as a defendant in this action.  On the same day, Pioneer served its arbitration submissionsto the arbitrator and Redhill.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  A week later, on 16 October 2009, Redhill tendered to Pioneer a cheque for the sum of HK$64,125 in settlement of Pioneerâs claimplus interest in the arbitration.  Redhill also agreed to bear the costs of the arbitration.  The tender was made without admissionof liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 19 October 2009, Pioneer returned the above cheque, only to request Redhill to draw the cheque in favour of Pioneerâs solicitorsinstead.  On the same day, Redhill took out a summons seeking to strike out Pioneerâs claim and to dismiss this action on the groundthat this is an abuse of process of the court, i.e., pursuant to O.18, r.19(1)(d) (â<b>the O.18 summons</b>â).  This became the other summons now before this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Redhill re-issued the cheque for settlement of the arbitration.  Pioneer accepted the same.  Pioneerâs claim in this action haseffectively been satisfied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 21 October 2009, Pioneer requested that Redhill withdrew the O.25 summons and the O.18 summons.  On the basis that Redhill hassatisfied its claim in full, Pioneer also proposed to discontinue this action subject to Redhillâs paying its costs of this action. Redhill rejected the proposal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>The O.25 summons</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As at the date of the O.25 summons, the deadlines for filing the timetabling questionnaire and to take out a case management summonspursuant to O.25, r.1 have lapsed.  Redhill had 2 options: to take out a case management summons pursuant to r.1(5)(a); or to applyto dismiss this action pursuant to r.1(5)(b).  Redhill opted for the latter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the hearing of such summons, r.1(6) empowers the court to grant an order in terms or, if not, to proceed as if this was a hearingof a case management summons.  Had the O.25 summons been heard at that stage, I think the court would likely have proceeded as ifthat were a case management hearing for the further conduct of this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The matters that the court would have considered during such a case management hearing then have subsequently been overtaken byevents.  Redhill has effectively satisfied Pioneerâs claim for the substantive relief in this action.  What remain outstandingare the proper disposal of this action and the issue of costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Khaw did not seem to insist that this action ought to be dismissed now on the ground of Pioneerâs non-compliance with O.25. Both counsel accepted that I am entitled to treat this as a case management hearing with a view to resolving how this action shouldbe disposed of and the issue of costs.  However, if Redhill succeeds in its application by the O.18 summons, the disposal of theO.25 summons will become consequential.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>The O.18 summons</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The sole ground for the application by the O.18 summons is that this action is an abuse of process of the court.  Mr Khaw for Redhillsubmitted that given the result in the arbitration proceedings, Pioneer has fully recouped its loss and hence the subject matterhas already been disposed of.  Therefore this action is liable to be struck out and dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Redhill has wasted no time in taking such stance.  After tendering payment to Pioneer on Friday, 16 October 2009, Redhill took outthe O.18 summons on the following Monday, 19 October 2009 even prior to Pioneerâs communicating to Redhill of its acceptance ofthe payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Khaw referred to Lord Nicollsâ speech in <i>The Personal Representatives of Tang Man-sit, deceased v Capacious Investments Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKLR 16</a> at 21C-E.  His Lordshipâs key point was the principle against double recovery by way of separate proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Indeed the situation now is that the dispute as to the substantive relief claimed in this action has become academic.  No doubtthis action has to be disposed of properly.  But such situation did not render this action an abuse of process overnight.  Further,the issue of costs of this action is outstanding, which the court still needs to determine.  By asking for a costs order in its favour,Pioneer is not seeking double recovery at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Khaw asked me to take into account the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  Pioneer should have properly considered the causes of action available to it when commencing this action.  Pioneer has failedto do so and chose to plead its case solely on the basis of negligence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  Subsequently Pioneer added the causes of action in the tort of nuisance and breach of the DMC.  In doing so, Pioneer has neglectedthe arbitration clause contained in the DMC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  Despite Redhillâs request, Pioneer insisted on withdrawing the cause of action for breach of the DMC for its reference to arbitrationwhilst maintaining this action in respect of the other causes of action.  Pioneer proceeded with this action and the arbitrationconcurrently.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  Notwithstanding the full satisfaction of the claim for damages and interest, Pioneer proposed to proceed to trial merely forthe purpose of determining the costs of this action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Chan for Pioneer justified the concurrent court action and arbitration by referring to a litigantâs right to pursue all thecauses of action available to him.  But in my view, Pioneerâs right to pursue all the causes of action is not the question here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Chan also submitted that notwithstanding the arbitration clause in the DMC, it would still be up to the parties to waive itsapplication and to resolve the dispute by way of court proceedings.  I agree.  But the fact was that Pioneer and Redhill could notagree on this; and Pioneer decided to maintain both this action and the arbitration in respect of the same incident and for the samerelief.  Strictly, this became objectionable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There were various alternatives at that stage.  Redhill could have applied for a stay of this action pending the outcome of thearbitration.  Alternatively, Redhill could have taken out a striking out application then (though, in my view, the court would likelyhave ordered a stay instead of dismissal of this action).  Lastly, Pioneer could have chosen to pursue its other causes of actiontoo in the arbitration.  In that case, Pioneer would have had to discontinue this action.  None of these steps has been taken.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Upon Pioneerâs notice of withdrawal of the cause of action for breach of the DMC, Redhill expressly reserved its right to makeapplication to strike out the claim in this action.  Redhill did not do so but proceeded to file the Defence.  This might fairlybe an act of prudence, given that Redhill was at the receiving end of this legal battle.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  However the approach of Redhill since then showed its actual preference of proceeding with this action rather than the arbitration. Redhill repeatedly requested to put the appointment of the arbitrator on hold pending the outcome of the trial of this action. Redhill represented to the HKIAC that the trial of this action was expected to be set down and concluded shortly.  Redhill also tookout the O.25 summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Without taking any substantive step in the arbitration, Redhill tendered payment in satisfaction of the Pioneerâs claim.  Onlythen did Redhill take out the O.18 summons, complaining that Pioneer should not have maintained this action after it has initiatedthe arbitration proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The arbitration has been settled.  Pioneerâs claim for substantive relief has been met.  Pioneer has no intention of proceedingwith this action further except to the extent necessary for the determination of the outstanding costs issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In view of that, Redhillâs present complaint that this action was liable to be struck out or be stayed has become academic.  Nodoubt the proceedings in this action need to be brought to an end.  But taking out the O.18 summons on the basis of abuse of processis hardly the right way of achieving that in the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Pioneer is also criticised for insisting on bringing this action to trial for the purpose of determining the issue of costs.  MrKhaw referred to <i>Graham M Morley v Kwan Wo Shan &amp; Ors</i>, HCA 4366/2003 (30 December 2009) where the learned Recorder remarked that it would be contrary to the objectives of the civil justicereform enshrined in O.1A, rr.1 and 2 for the parties to go to trial for the purpose of resolving the issue of costs.  Given thatthe plaintiff has already recovered its alleged loss, the substantial costs necessitated by the trial would be wholly unnecessaryand disproportionate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In my view, how the issue of costs should and could be determined, where the substantive issues have become academic, varies fromcase to case.  This is actually in line with the learned Recorderâs observation in <i>Graham M Morley</i> after summarising the authorities in this context.  They included the Hong Kong authorities of <i>Re Chinese United Establishment Ltd</i>, HCCW 391/1994 (5 October 1995), <i>Ta Tung China &amp; Arts Ltd v Fontana Restaurant Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 404</a> and <i>Re Super Deluxe International Ltd</i>, HCCW 186/2001 (3 June 2003).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In <i>Re Chinese United Establishment Ltd</i>, a consent order was made on the second day of the trial settling the petition on the basis of no admission and either party hadthe liberty to seek costs against each other.  Upon the making of the order, the petitioner applied for costs and the respondentresisted.  The court made a costs order in favour of the petitioner on the footing that the petitioner had obtained what he cameto the court for.  On appeal, the court of appeal saw no justification for interfering with the trial judgeâs exercise of discretion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In <i>Ta Tung</i>, the parties resolved their differences before trial such that the substantive issues had become academic.  A summons was taken outfor the determination of the issue of costs by the court.  The matter went on appeal and the appellate court held that it was impossibleto have the costs liability issue resolved without having the action disposed of in one of 2 ways: seeking leave to discontinue theaction and asking for the costs to be determined; or by going to trial and having the costs dealt with after the trial.  The courtconcluded that the only way the plaintiff in that case could recover his costs, if the defendant refused to pay them, was to bringthe action to trial for the purpose of doing so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In <i>Re Super Deluxe International</i>, the learned Judge did not think that anything said in the above 2 cases would tie the hands of the court as to what evidence itshould or should not receive and what findings it should or should not make in a particular case for the purpose of adjudicatingon costs.  In that case, the court was indeed asked by the respondents to receive evidence and to make a finding on the petitionersâentitlement to the relief sought for the purpose of adjudicating on costs.  The court accepted that she should do so.  For that purpose,parties had to put in affidavit evidence and the court had to assess the evidence in the light of the cross examination of the witnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The learned Recorder in <i>Graham M Morley</i> agreed with the learned Judgeâs observation in <i>Re Super Deluxe International</i>.  <i>Graham M Morley</i> is similar to <i>Re Chinese United Establishment Ltd</i> in that the action was disposed of by a consent order leaving only the issue of costs outstanding.  The 2 cases differed from <i>Ta Tung</i> where the appellate court found it impossible to adjudicate on costs without also disposing of the action one way or the other.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The learned Recorder in <i>Graham M Morley</i> carried out the above analysis (at paras.24-32) before making the remarks (at para.33) that Mr Khaw referred to in his submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The learned Recorder went on to conclude (at para.34) that the question then is whether the court is in a position to make an orderfor costs.  This depends on the circumstances of the case.  There is no hard and fast rule.  The circumstances of <i>Graham M Morley</i> were that no party argued that the learned Recorder had to determine the substantive issues in order to determine the costs.  Indeedall parties agreed that he should proceed to determine costs without hearing evidence and without attempting to determine on paperwhose version of events would likely have prevailed, had there been a trial (see para.37).  The circumstances were quite differentfrom <i>Re Super Deluxe International</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In view of the above, I do not agree that by proposing to bring this action to trial for the purpose of adjudicating costs, Pioneeris abusing the process of the court.  In his submissions, Mr Chan also accepted that it would be up to the court to decide whetherit is in a position to resolve the issue of costs without going into the substantive issues or the actual merits of partiesâ respectivecases.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  For the above reasons, the O.18 summons fails.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Costs of this action</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Neither the O.25 summons nor the O.18 summons succeeds in having this action dismissed.  In this event, parties agree that thiscourt may treat this as a case management hearing with a view to resolving how this action should be disposed of and the issue ofcosts of this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  On behalf of Pioneer, Mr Chan asked for leave to discontinue this action and for costs of this action.  Both parties asked thiscourt to adjudicate on the issue of costs without going into the substantive issues.  In my view, I am in a position to rule on thecosts issues upon disposing of this action.  I am also satisfied that a broad brush approach, as the court in <i>Re Chinese United Establishment Ltd</i> and the learned Recorder in <i>Graham M Morley</i> applied, could be adopted in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that Pioneer should be entitled to the costs of this action on the very simply footing that it is essentiallythe successful party.  Pioneer has obtained what it had to come to court to get.  It is neither here nor there that Redhill choseto settle the arbitration instead of this action.  The substantive relief claimed pursuant to the various causes of action was justidentical.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the affirmation filed on its behalf, Redhill explained that it recognised that its legal position in respect of the new causesof action, including the breach of the DMC, was not as good as that in the negligence claim.  Hence Redhill decided to settle thearbitration.  Mr Chan submitted that if Redhill had intended to meet Pioneerâs claim due to such consideration, Redhill could havedone so when the new cause of action was first pleaded in this action.  Instead, Redhill rejected Pioneerâs request to consentto have this additional cause of action resolved in this action and insisted on referring this cause of action to arbitration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I agree with Mr Chan.  It was the consideration of the merits of the case that caused Redhill to decide to meet Pioneerâs entireclaim for breach of the DMC.  Whether this cause of action should in principle be resolved in this action or by way of arbitrationwas immaterial to such decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Further, the reference of the cause of action for breach of the DMC to arbitration per se hardly had any significant bearing onthe merits of the claim.  As mentioned above, after the claim for breach of the DMC has been referred to arbitration upon the insistenceof Redhill, Redhill actually preferred proceeding with this action to the arbitration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Redhill decided to meet the claim after its consideration of Pioneerâs submissions in the arbitration.  But the materials in supportof such submissions do not appear to differ materially from those already disclosed and relied on by Pioneer in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Khaw submitted that the question of costs turns on the partiesâ conduct.  He was referring to the matters already discussedabove.  I do not repeat them here.  In view of the approach Redhill has adopted at different stages, I agree with Mr Chan that Redhillcould not be heard to say that it was Pioneerâs unreasonable conduct that has resulted in the duplication of proceedings and escalationof costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Order</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In the circumstances, I make the following order:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  leave to Pioneer to discontinue this action;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  costs of the O.25 summons be to Redhill;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  the O.18 summons be dismissed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)  save as aforesaid, Redhill shall pay Pioneerâs costs of this action, including the costs of and occasioned by the O.18 summons;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5)  all costs ordered shall be taxed, if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">                </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Simon Leung<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:justify">                </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Anthony CHAN instructed by Messrs Leung &amp; Lau for the Plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Richard KHAW instructed by Messrs JSM for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2010/55.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
