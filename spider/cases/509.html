The need for such regulationis amply illustrated by the present litigation which stems from the fraudulent way Asean Merchant Credit And Investment Limited ("Asean"),a registered D.T.C., conducted its business in the early 1980s.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Asean started business as a Registered D. T. C. in April 1979. It was suspended by the Commissioner of D.T.C.s on 9th March 1983,following which it went into liquidation with liabilities exceeding assets by more than HK$160 million. Subsequent to Asean's suspension,it became clear that its managing director, Mr Alexis Chan, and its general manager, Mr Jesse Perez were both rogues who had dishonestlymismanaged the company's affairs over a long period of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> One of the victims of Asean's collapse was Zanda Investment Limited ("Zanda"), the plaintiff in the present proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Zanda was a company formed in 1980 to buy NKIL5048 at Ming Fung Street, Kowloon ("the Ming Fung Street property"), develop it byerecting a building, and then sell it off at a profit. Asean owned 50% of the shares in Zanda, and played a major role in financingand supervising that development. Zanda had its registered office at, and conducted its business from the same premises in New WorldTower, Central where Asean ran its own business.   Zanda having no separate staff of its own, instead used Asean's. Mr Jesse Perezwas one of Zartda's two directors. Mr Alexis Chan had no formal position in Zanda, but, in practice, was the prime-mover in arrangingfor its development project to be carried out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> When Zanda bought the land in May 1980, the price was $16.5 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In 1981, it agreed to sell the land to Tai Ting Estates Limited ("Tai Ting Estates") for HK$41 million on the basis that completionwas not to take place until Zanda had finished erecting a twenty-three storey building on the site, and the Occupation Permit forit was issued. As provided by the Agreement, Tai Ting Estates paid Zanda a deposit of $4.1 million, and four progress payments of$2.05 million each on architect's certificates when the building reached the eighth, twelfth, sixteenth floors and roof, respectively.That deposit together with the progress payments totalled $12.3 million, leaving a balance of HK$28.7 million payable to Zanda afterthe issue of the Occupation Permit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The building was finished in or about June 1983 and the, Occupation Permit was issued on 6th August 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Asean, purporting to act on behalf of Zanda, received a series of four cheques and two cashier orders totalling $28.7 million forthe balance of the purchase money from the solicitors for the purchasers, Tai Ting Estates, between the 9th August and 7th September1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Had the whole proceeds of those four cheques and two cashier orders been applied properly by Asean for Zanda's benefit, Zanda wouldhave finished up with a profit of HK$6,856,670 (before tax) for distribution amongst its shareholders after the payment of all creditors(excluding the Inland Revenue Department). Instead of that, Zanda finds itself $15,738,706 short because of the dishonest way inwhich Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez caused funds to be directed from Asean to their own purposes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> One of the four cheques relating to the completion monies was for $5 million drawn on American Express International Banking Corporation.That cheque was dated 7th September 1983 and Zanda was shown as the payee. The solicitor for Tai Ting Estates, in issuing the cheque,deleted the printed words "or bearer" from its face after the space for the payee's name. He also crossed the cheque with a chopwhich included the words between the transverse lines of the crossing, "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only".</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Ms Stephenie Chan, who, besides being employed by Asean as personal secretary to Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez, was also an alternatedirector and authorised signatory of Zanda, indorsed the cheque in blank at a time Mr Jesse Perez was away from the office by signingit on the back along the dotted line left by a chop she applied, showing the words, "Zanda Investment Ltd" immediately above hersignature, and the words "Authorized Signature" below. She did that on the 7th September 1983 on the instructions of Mr Alexis Chan.After signing in the way just described, she handed the cheque over to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr Alexis Chan that same day had the cheque indorsed on behalf of Asean and caused it immediately to be paid into Asean's currentaccount with the Bank of America.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> As at the 7th September 1983, Asean's current account with Bank of America was over-drawn by $6,259,079. Bank of America immediatelycredited that account with the $5 million face value of the cheque, thereby reducing the debit balance to $1,259,079, and then, throughthe inter-bank clearing system, collected the $5 million represented by the cheque from the paying bank, American Express InternationalBanking Corporation, on which that cheque was drawn.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Besides the cheque for $5 million just described, Ms Stephenie Chan at the same time had also received a cheque for $1 million fromthe solicitors for Tai Ting Estates in favour of Zanda as payee, drawn on the Causeway Bay Branch of Barclays Bank InternationalLimited ("Barclays") as part of the completion monies. That cheque for $1 million was in exactly the same form as the cheque for$5 million I have just described. Following Mr Alexis Chan's direction, she indorsed this $1 million cheque in exactly the same wayas the $5 million cheque, after which she handed it to Mr Alexis Chan who had it indorsed in blank by Asean in the same way as the$5 million cheque, and caused it to be paid into the Gloucester Tower Branch of Barclays with a view to having the proceeds creditedto the Causeway Bay Branch of Barclays where Asean had a current account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> As at the 7th September 1983 when the payment-in took place, that current account with Barclays was overdrawn by $5,669,184. On payment-in,Barclays straight away credited Asean with $1 million, thereby reducing the overdraft to $4,669,184.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> As a matter of coincidence, the collecting bank and the paying bank were the same - Barclays - in relation to the $1 million cheque,but this is of no significance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> By the present consolidated proceedings, Zanda sues Bank of America for the $5 million and Barclays for the $1 million representedby the cheques I have just described, alleging that the purported indorsement by Ms Stephenie Chan of the cheques was unauthorisedso that, in collecting the proceeds of the cheques, the banks are liable in conversion or for money had and received.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Those acting for Zanda do not allege that either bank acted in bad faith while making these collections for Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Each of the Defendant-banks claims by way of defence that Asean acted with the authority of Zanda, actual or apparent, in deliveringthe cheques to the banks for collection into an Asean account. Moreover, both Defendant-banks contend they fall within the ambitof the protection afforded by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19">Cap.19</a> to collecting banks which in good faith and without negligence collect the proceeds of cheques on behalf of their customers.There are contributory negligence, estoppel and an equitable defence also pleaded on behalf of the Defendant-banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The Defendant-banks in their turn have joined in Ms Stephenie Chan as a third party in case their defences against Zanda do not prevail.Those third party proceedings have been stood over pending the outcome of the main action between Zanda and the Defendant-banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Asean, too, was joined in as a third party by the Defendant-banks. Judgment by consent was allowed against it in their favour, but,in practice, such judgment would be virtually worthless to the banks should they need to enforce it due to Asean's extreme insolvency.</p>    <p class="heading">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> For a full understanding of the present case, it is important to know what was happening to Hong Kong's economy and financial marketsat material times. An invaluable source of information on that has been Mr T.K. Ghose's book, The Banking System of Hong Kong, towhich those appearing for Zanda drew the court's attention. The history it recounts serves well to refresh the memory of anyone wholived in Hong Kong during that era, as do the official Hong Kong Annual Reports for that same period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> At the time Asean commenced operations as a registered D.T.C. in April 1979, Hong Kong's economy was thriving. A land and share-marketboom was by then already well under way. Banks and D.T.C.s generally helped fuel that boom by liberal lending policies which, withhindsight, can be seen to have encouraged speculation in real estate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> D.T.C.s can loosely be described as "secondary banks". They were in the business of borrowing and lending money, frequently operatingin areas such as trade financing and currency dealing where one also finds ordinary banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The great advantage enjoyed by D.T.C.s over banks was the former not being bound by the interest-rate-agreement of the Hong KongAssociation of Banks which imposes a ceiling on the rate of interest banks can pay for money on deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> A further advantage enjoyed by D.T.C.s then was the relatively light way in which they were regulated compared to banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> To become eligible for registration under the Ordinance, the minimum paid-up capital required of a D.T.C. was $2.5 million. Thatwas no problem for Asean which started off with paid up capital of $10 million, later increased to $15 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Disadvantages suffered by D.T.C.s compared to banks were that D.T.C.s were not permitted to offer cheque-cashing facilities on theircustomers' current accounts, and could not accept deposits from the public of less than $50,000 at a time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> To avoid the restrictions of the interest-rate-agreement of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, many a bank formed its own subsidiaryto become registered and conduct operations as a D.T.C.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Time was to show that the wholly bank-owned D.T.C.s, because of the backing of a parent bank, were safe from the point of view ofcustomers not losing their money, whereas some of the non-wholly bank-owned D.T.C.s were to prove disastrous for lenders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> While Asean was not owned by any bank, some of its shareholders had strong indirect links with banks. The largest shareholder inAsean was a company controlled by Mr Johnny Cheng who had a controlling interest in Hang Lung Bank and a substantial holding in O.C.I.L.which, through I.C.I.L., owned Overseas Trust Bank ("O.T.B."). Mr Johnny Cheng is the father of Mr Jesse Perez who became generalmanager of Asean. A company controlled by the family of Mr Chang Ming Thien, which owned the controlling interest on O.C.I.L., andhence, via I.C.I.L., in O.T.B., also had a small equity holding in Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Besides the families of the wealthy bankers Mr Johnny Cheng and Mr Chang Ming Thien, there was another wealthy family which had asubstantial stake in Asean. That was the family of Mr Chan Ching Pau, the father of Mr Alexis Chan who became managing director ofAsean. The wealth of Mr Chan Ching Pau's family stemmed from textiles, real estate dealing and property development. Mr Chan ChingPau's principal company was Kin Fung Hong Limited ("Kin Fung Hong").</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Johnny Cheng, Mr Chang Ming Thien, Mr Chan Chau Ping and their families were not only generally known for their wealth, but theywere also widely regarded as people of integrity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> A further feature of Asean calculated to increase the confidence of potential lenders to it from the outset was the perceived competenceof its top management. Mr Alexis Chan, Asean's managing director, had gained experience as a banker working for O.T.B. over a periodof years, while Mr Jesse Perez, Asean's general manager, had worked in his father's bank, Hang Lung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> With this alluring combination of wealthy, respectable owners and experienced management, Asean looked set for a bright future, startingoff as it did in a booming economy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> One potential source of funds for Asean was deposits from the public. Far and away its greatest source of financing in practice,though, was borrowings from banks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The first of the banks to grant credit facilities to Asean was Bank of America through its branch at Western. That branch alreadyhad Mr Chan Ching Pau's company, Kin Fung Hong Textiles Ltd, as a much-prized account which generated considerable business for thebranch.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It was clearly regarded as something of an honour by Bank of America's Western branch when Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez indicatedthey wanted that branch to be Asean's main bankers. The staff of Bank of America liked the idea that in Mr Alexis Chan and Mr JessePerez they were dealing with fellow bankers, and were happy to take on a customer backed by such wealthy families.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The initial facility agreed between Asean and Bank of America was US$1.3 million. Some of that was secured, the rest not. Of greatcomfort to Bank of America were the personal guarantees given by Mr Johnny Cheng, Mr Jesse Perez and Mr Alexis Chan in respect ofthe Asean account. Based on the extensive material from Bank of America's records relating to this account, and on the oral evidenceof its staff who handled the account, I have no doubt of the sincerity of Bank of America's personnel in their belief at all materialtimes in the integrity of those managing and owning Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In June 1979, Asean opened a line of credit for US$3 million with the Causeway Bay Branch of Barclays Bank, the staff of which werejust as dazzled by the wealth, apparent integrity, and competence of those owning and running Asean as had been their competitorsat Bank of America. Like Bank of America, Barclays offered Asean lines of credit, some secured, some unsecured, and took personalguarantees from Johnny Cheng and Mr Alexis Chan for the sum of US$3 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> With time, Barclays' superseded Bank of America as Asean's principal bankers, but Bank of America still continued to offer substantialcredit facilities to Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> A long procession of different banks opened lines of credit for Asean. By 1982, there were no less than ten banks besides Bank ofAmerica and Barclays, with lines of credit to a combined value of $150 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> To attract and then keep banks as lenders, Asean was able to show it was engaged in the type of business of which bank lenders wouldbe likely to approve. It did a substantial volume of trade financing which involved letters of credit, lending against trust receiptsand discounting of bills of exchange. Such work was right up the street of Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez with their backgroundin banking. To know that Asean was engaged in that type of work with Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez at the helm must have beenreassuring to its bank-lenders. That was conventional banking work for an entity like Asean which, as I have said, was in the natureof a secondary bank. The other type of financing in which Asean was engaged - real estate development - did not fit so readily inthe mould of conventional banking, secondary or otherwise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The conventional wisdom in banking has generally been, "Lend short, but borrow long". As Mr Ghose's book shows, the banking communityin Hong Kong largely either forgot or chose to disregard the more cautious approach of earlier generations of bankers, and, in thefew years of the land boom in Hong Kong climaxing in the crash of 1982, bankers lent large sums of money, either directly, or indirectlythrough D.T.C.s, for land speculation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> When the chickens came home to roost for Asean after the suspension of its registration in March 1983, a high proportion of its baddebts related to real estate loans it had made. It subsequently came to light, too, that much of Asean's lending for real estatetransactions involved criminal infringements of provisions in the Deposit-Taking Company Ordinance, as well as oughtright fraud.Certainly Bank of America, and probably Barclays, knew that Asean was involved in financing real estate developments - The Zandaproject being one example - but they had not the slightest inkling of the illegalities Asean was perpetrating.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Many of the financial ventures with which Asean was associated turned out to be catastrophic. One, however, involving a sound concept,good timing and what should have been a profitable conclusion for those backing it was that centred on Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Zanda is a Hong Kong Company incorporated in 1980 with an authorised capital of $10 million, and issued capital of 4 million $1 shares.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Asean took a 50% interest in Zanda by subscribing for 2 million $1 shares, O.C.I.L. took a 40% interest with 1.6 million of the issuedshares, and a company called Northbourne Ltd. (Northbourne) took the remaining 10%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Reference has already been made to O.C.I.L. as the majority shareholder of I.C.I.L., the holding company for O.T.B. The major shareholderof O.C.I.L. at that time was Mr Chang Ming Thien, the Chairman of O.T.B. Mr Chang Ming Thien had a son, Mr Patrick Chang, who wasa director of O.T.B.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Patrick Chang and Mr Jesse Perez each held 50% of the shares in Northbourne.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The first two directors appointed for Zanda were Mr Jesse Perez and Mr S. Y. Ho.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho had been the General Manager of O.C.I.L. since 1969, and of both O.C.I.L. and I.C.I.L. since 1975 when I.C.I.L. was interposedbetween O.C.I.L. and O.T.B. as the holding company of O.T.B. Mr S.Y. Ho was simply an employee of O.C.I.L. and I.C.I.L., unrelatedto the owners. He did, however, form part of the web of connections between Zanda and Asean in that he was a former colleague ofAlexis Chan, both of them having worked together in the bills department of O.T.B. in the early 1960s. They became friends then,and remained so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> On behalf of Zanda, it has been asserted that Mr S.Y. Ho was on Zanda's board to look after the interests of O.C.I.L. That is broadlyspeaking correct, but is something of an oversimplification in that it fails to acknowledge that in reality he was exposed to a hostof conflicting pressures due to the various cross-holdings between O.C.I.L. and Asean, and the various interests of the three wealthyfamilies - Mr Chan Ching Pau's, Mr Chang Ming Thien's and Mr Johnny Cheng's - in Zanda. Such influences, plus his friendship withMr Alexis Chan, were not always to make it easy for Mr S.Y. Ho to treat Asean in an arm's length way in relation to Zanda's affairs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho served as director on the boards of many companies in which O.C.I.L. had an interest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Jesse Perez was on Zanda's Board ostensibly to represent Asean. Although Mr Alexis Chan was never on the board of Zanda, his presencelooms large in the conduct of its business.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> From the outset, the shareholders of Zanda knew what they wanted from the company: it was to be used in effect as a joint venturevehicle by the shareholders to buy the Ming Fung Street property, develop it by putting up a new building, sell that off at a profitfor distribution amongst the shareholders, after which, the company would be voluntarily wound up, having achieved its purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It was Mr Alexis Chan who took the initiative in finding the Ming Fung Street property for Zanda to buy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The first formal step of any significance taken on behalf of Zanda was to enter into a written Agreement dated 21st May 1980 to buyfrom The Grand English College Company Limited ("The Grand English College") the Ming Fung Street property together with the variousbuildings on it for $16.5 million. As part payment of the purchase money, Zanda had to pay a deposit of $ 4.5 million. That $ 4.5million deposit was funded from Zanda's capital, and by advances from its shareholders in proportion to each one's shareholding,Asean thus contributing 50%, O.C.I.L. 40% and Northbourne 10%. Shareholders' advances in the same proportions funded the $12 millionbalance of the purchase money paid to The Grand English College on 15th August 1980, the date of the formal assignment of the MingFung Street property to Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Zanda's first directors' meeting was held 3rd June 1980 at Room 2608, New World Tower, Central. That was the address of Zanda's registeredoffice. It was also the address of the actual office where Asean carried on its business as a D.T.C. with a staff of approximatelytwenty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> To save money, it had been agreed amongst the shareholders of Zanda that, instead of having its own accommodation and staff, Zanda,without charge, could use Asean's office and Asean's staff. Under this arrangement, Asean's staff did all the clerical work necessaryfor Zanda, kept its records, books of account and its minute book. All Zanda's day-to-day business with outsiders was conducted fromAsean's office premises by Asean personnel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The member of Asean's staff who did most of Zanda's routine clerical work, and wrote up its ledger was Ms Stephenie Chan. She waswith Asean as a personal secretary to Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez from the time Asean commenced business as a D.T.C. in April1979. She was aged only 19 then. Her training had been as a secretary, having spent one year at a secretarial training school afterleaving school at the age of 16. She plays an important role in the present case as the one who, on 7th September 1983, alone indorsedthe two cheques in issue at a time when she was an alternate director to Jesse Perez in Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> At the first meeting of Zanda's Board, on 3rd June 1980, not only were its directors, Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez present, butso was Mr Alexis Chan, accompanied by his friend and business associate, Mr Edward Wong, a partner in the firm of architects andengineers, Messrs Leung and Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> On that occasion Zanda's directors formally decided to develop the Ming Fung Street property by demolishing the existing structuresand erecting a mixed commercial-residential building. Messrs Leung and Wong were appointed architects for the project.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> A further decision taken at that first directors' meeting was for Zanda to open a current account with O.T.B. That current accountwas kept in funds by Zanda's shareholders in the ratios 5:4:1 by Asean, O.C.I.L. and Northboume, respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> For the purpose of opening that account with O.T.B., Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez both signed O.T.B. standard forms (Trial BundleA394/4-6) for the opening of an account by a company. The mandate they gave O.T.B. was to pay cheques drawn on behalf of Zanda signedby Mr S. Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez jointly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> A major purpose to which that current account was put was the payment of interest on a $6 million mortgage of the Ming Fung Streetproperty to Daiwa Overseas Finance Limited ("Daiwa Overseas Finance") on 15th August 1980.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Daiwa Overseas Finance was a registered D.T.C., jointly owned by O.T.C. and Daiwa Bank of Japan. In connection with that mortgage,Zanda opened a loan account with Daiwa Overseas Finance. (See Trial Bundle A, pages 50, 51 and 57). The mandate for that, too, requiredthe joint signatures of Mr S. Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> That $6 million mortgage loan was used, in effect, to re-finance part of the outlays by Zanda's shareholders for the purchase ofthe Ming Fung Street property. Of the $6 million, $3 million went to Asean, $2.4 million to O.T.B. and $0.6 million to Northbourne,that is to say, in proportion to their shareholdings in Zanda.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> Of considerable relevance for the purpose of the present case is the way the $6 million from Daiwa Overseas Finance was distributedto Zanda's shareholders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho was the one who, on behalf of Zanda, liaised with Daiwa Overseas Finance's solicitor over the mechanics of the actualpayment of the $6 million mortgage monies to Zanda. After instructing the solicitor to make the cheque for the $6 million payableto Asean, Mr S.Y. Ho, by a letter dated 3rd September 1980 to Asean, requested Mr Alexis Chan to arrange for Asean to issue its chequefor $3 million, made up, in effect, of the $2.4 million due to O.C.I.L. and the $0.6 million due Northbourne under the re-financingarrangement already described. Asean was to keep $3 million of the $6 million mortgage monies for itself. Without wishing to overloadan already complicated narrative with unnecessary detail, I merely note that the vehicle nominated by Mr S.Y. Ho to receive Asean'scheque for $3 million was Kang Sun Enterprises Ltd, a subsidiary of O.C.I.L. which accounted to O.C.I.L. for its $2.4 million shareand to Northboume for its $0.6 million share of the Daiwa Overseas Finance mortgage monies. (See Trial Bundle A, pages 264/1 to 10).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Thus, from a relatively early stage in the relationship between Zanda and Asean, one finds Asean, with the full concurrence of O.C.IL.via Mr S. Y. Ho, being used as a repository for and distributor of Zanda's funds amongst Zanda's shareholders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Chronologically, the next milestone of significance in the affairs of Zanda was the decision by Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez atits board meeting of 3rd October 1980 to exercise the power in Article 48 of Zanda's Articles of Association to appoint alternatedirectors. I now set out the relevant parts of that Article : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"48. A Director may at any time appoint any other person (whether a Director or Member of the Company or not) to act as AlternateDirector at any Meeting of the Board at which the Director is not present, and may at any time revoke any such appointment. An AlternateDirector so appointed shall not be entitled as such to receive any remuneration from the Company, but shall otherwise be subjectto the provisions of Table A and of these presents with regard to Directors. An Alternate Director shall be entitled to receive noticesof all Meetings of the Board and to attend and vote as a Director at any such Meeting at which the Director appointing him is notpersonally present, and generally to perform all the functions, rights, powers and duties of the Director by whom he was appointedin his capacity as a Director but not in his capacity as a manager or working Director. An Alternate Director shall ipso facto ceaseto be an Alternate Director if his appointor ceases for any reason to be a Director: Provided that if a Director retires by rotationand is .... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The resolution passed at the board meeting was as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"ALTERNA TE DIRECTORS</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">It was suggested to appoint two alternate directors to Messrs. J. Perez and S.Y. Ho who would carry out the Company affairs in theirabsence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">It was resolved that Miss Carmencita Cheng and Mr Eddie Leung Sze Shing be and are hereby appointed alternate directors to Mr J. Perezand Mr S.Y. Ho respectively and that their appointment be made effective with retrospect on 15th August, 1980."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> The Miss Carmencita C. Cheng there referred to as the alternate director to Mr Jesse Perez was his half-sister, both of them havingMr Johnny Cheng as their father but different mothers. She worked as the cashier in Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> Mr Eddie Leung, Mr S.Y. Ho's alternate director was, like Mr S Y Ho, one of O.C.I.L.'s paid staff unconnected to the families ofthe major shareholders in O.C.I.L. In O.C.I.L., as assistant manager, he was subordinate to Mr S.Y. Ho, the general manager.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> In due course, it will be necessary to look at some of the other Articles of Zanda, including those brought in by Table A of the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, in the context of whether an alternate director of Zanda could be empowered to indorse away a cheque made payable to the company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> A follow-up to the resolution at the board meeting of 3rd October 1980 was a document dated 4th December 1980, signed by Mr JessePerez and Mr S.Y. Ho, as well as by Miss Carmencita Cheng and Mr Eddie Leung, in the following form:</p>    <p style="text-align:center">âSPECIAL RESOLUTION</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Passed on the 3rd day of October 980</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center">---------------</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">At a Meeting .of the Board of Directors of the Company duly convened and held at Room 2608, New World Tower, Central, Hong Kong on3rd day of October, 1980, it was resolved THAT:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">'Miss Carmencita C.

Impressionsof their specimen signatures are shown hereunder.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> That foreshadows the time when, on 1st May 1983, Ms Stephenie Chan would be substituted for Miss Carmencita Cheng as alternate directorto Mr Jesse Perez in Zanda, and Zanda's board would resolve that, with effect from the same date, Miss Carmencita Cheng would bereplaced by Ms Stephenie Chan as Zanda's authorised signatory (Trial Bundle A, p.67).</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> After becoming alternate directors, Miss Carmencita Cheng and Mr Eddie Leung became signatories for Zanda's current account withO.T.B. and its loan account with Daiwa Overseas Finance on the basis of Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung comprising an "A" group, andMr Jesse Perez and Ms Carmencita Cheng comprising a "B" group. Those accounts could be operated on the joint signatures of one personfrom the "A" group, and one from the "B".</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Messrs Leung and Wong, the architects retained by Zanda, got their plans and specifications for the proposed development of the MingFung Street property approved by the Building Authority on 5th November 1980. The approved plan was for a 23-storeyed building consistingof shops on the ground floor, offices on the first floor and flats on the remaining floors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> All that Zanda needed now was a buyer for the proposed development.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> This it got after an uneventful phase of clearing the site when, in about the third quarter of 1981, Mr Alexis Chan, prominent asever in the affairs of Zanda, found a purchaser through his brother-in-law, Mr John Chau, a partner in Messrs Tsang, Chau and Shuen,a firm of solicitors which also became Zanda's solicitors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> That purchaser was Tai Ting Estates, a public company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> Because of the work already done by Zanda in planning a development, and clearing the site, Zanda was able to sell the Ming FungStreet property to Tai Ting for $41 million (of which $4.1 million was to be paid as a deposit) on the basis the price was to includea 23-storeyed building to be erected by Zanda in accordance with the plans approved by the Building Authority on 5th November 1980.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> Although there was no reference to this in the Agreement, the contractor to erect the building was Ray On Limited, a company substantiallyowned by Mr Johnny Cheng, Asean's largest shareholder. Mr Alexis Chan was instrumental in getting that contractor for this Zandadevelopment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> The written Agreement concerning this transaction between Zanda and Tai Ting Estates was made on 3rd September 1981. It providedthat Zanda must erect the building within 660 working days, which meant by the 25th June 1983.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Payment of the purchase price by Tai Ting Estates to Zanda was to be in accordance with a Schedule to the Agreement. I now set outthe content of that Schedule:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"1. A sum of $4,100,000.00 shall be paid as deposit and part payment of the purchase price on the signing of this Agreement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">2.

The cheque payable to Zanda for the $4.1 million deposit had also taken the same form.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Payment on behalf of Tai Ting Estates was made by Messrs Tsang, Chau and Shuen sending the cheques and cashier orders I have justdescribed to Zanda at its registered office which was the same place where Asean had its actual office.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Each and every one of those cheques, starting with the cheque for the deposit, was indorsed in blank on its back by at least onedirector or alternate director of Zanda, with his or her signature on the dotted line left by the Zanda chop under the words "ZandaInvestment Ltd" and above the words "Authorized Signature".</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> The cheque for the deposit of $4.1 million was endorsed by a director or alternate director from the O.C.I.L. side in Zanda, andlikewise from the Asean side. The proceeds from that cheque, less some agent's commission, were placed on deposit with Asean to earninterest initially, but later were uplifted to help, inter alia, payoff the Daiwa loan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> The cheque for the first stage payment was dated the 12th July 1982, and sent to Zanda's office on the same day. The second stagepayment was made in the same way by a cheque dated and sent to Zanda's office on 2nd September 1982. The cheque for the deposit andthe cheques for the first two stage payments had been treated in the same way, by being indorsed in blank on behalf of Zanda by MrJesse Perez or his alternate Miss Carmencita Cheng for the Asean side, and Mr S.Y. Ho or his alternate Mr Eddie Leung for the O.C.I.L.side. Such indorsements had the effect of making the cheques bearer cheques. With the full concurrence of Mr S.Y. Ho, and Mr EddieLeung, those cheques were left with Asean so that Asean could pay them into any of its own bank accounts. It would have been MissStephenie Chan, under the direction of either Mr Alexis Chan or Mr Jesse Perez, who set about arranging the indorsements by Mr S.Y.Ho or Mr Eddie Leung on those cheques.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> The processing of the cheque for the third stage payment, made on the 28th October 1982, did not follow the same course as the chequesfor the earlier stage payments. This time, an indorsement on behalf of Zanda was made by Mr Jesse Perez alone, without any signatureof Mr S.Y. Ho or Mr Eddie Leung representing the O.C.I.L. side. That cheque was collected for Asean's current account by the Bankof America. There was no protest either from Mr S. Y. Ho or Mr Eddie Leung at what Asean had done in receiving the proceeds of thatcheque made payable to Zanda without securing a joint signature by way of indorsement from the O.C.I.L. side. It is quite possiblethat at the time it simply escaped the attention of Mr S.Y. Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung that the third stage payment must have beencollected by Asean without Asean first of all seeking a signature from the O.C.I.L. side to acknowledge it was in order for Aseanto collect the money. I have no doubt, based on the evidence in this case as a whole, that, if at the time Asean collected paymenton that cheque, Mr S.Y. Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung had known what Asean was doing, there would have been no objection from either ofthem since they regarded it as Asean's role to collect all payments in favour of Zanda. This collection for Asean of a cheque madepayable to Zanda on the strength of an indorsement from the Asean side only foreshadows what was to happen on the 7th September 1983when the disputed cheques in Zanda's favour were collected by Bank of America and Barclays on the basis of an indorsement of MissStephenie Chan alone as alternate director on behalf of Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> The last of the four stage payments was made by a cheque in Zanda's favour on the 14th December 1982. No doubt, it would have beensigned by either Mr Jesse Perez or his alternate Miss Carmencita Cheng on behalf of the Asean element of Zanda, but whether it wasalso endorsed by Mr S.Y. Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung cannot be deduced from the evidence. The cheque itself is missing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> Each and everyone of the first five cheques payable to Zanda under the agreement with Tai Ting, namely, in respect of the depositand the four stage payments, can be seen to have been indorsed in blank, with the result that they could be paid into one of Asean'sbank accounts. That was the result Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung wanted since they had, in effect, left it to Mr Alexis Chan andMr Jesse Perez to administer the building project, which of course, included the payment of all the expenses incurred in building.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> The four cheques (including the two in issue collected by Bank of America and Barclays) and two cashier-orders making up the $28.7million balance on completion carried the single signature of either Mr Jesse Perez or his then alternate, Ms Stephenie Chan, incombination with Zanda's chop, as purported indorsement. Those appearing for Zanda dispute that a single signature could be a validindorsement for Zanda : there had to be joint signatures of one director or alternate director from the O.C.I.L. "A" group, and onefrom the Asean "B" group, they argue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> The individual cheques by which the various payments under the Schedule to the Sale and Purchase Agreement between Zanda and TaiTing Estates were made, will be looked at again in more detail as the narrative unfolds.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> Returning to September 1981 when Zanda and Tai Ting Estates made their Agreement, one can see it roughly marked a watershed in Zanda'shistory.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> Up until then, Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung on the O.C.I.L. side had been relatively involved in Zanda's financial affairs by signinga cheque from time to time drawn on its O.T.B. current account, and making sure that O.C.I.L. provided its 40% share of paymentsinto that account by Zanda's shareholders. Once the Agreement with Tai Ting Estates was signed, however, that account became moreor less dormant. The last time any funds were paid into that account was 10th October 1981when $200,00 was deposited. That broughtthe accounts credit balance up to $248,367. Apart from debit items for $132,000 on 10th December 1981 and $114,750 on 7th December1982, the account was virtually inactive, although it remained open. Without having to do as much as sign cheques even, Mr S. Y.Ho and Mr Eddie Leung, took even more of a back-seat in the running of Zanda's affairs. Once in a while, they might go to have alook from the outside at the progress being made on the development at the Ming Fat Street property, but otherwise, the people atAsean were left to get on with the running of Zanda's affairs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> From the time of Zanda's Agreement with Tai Ting Estates, Asean took over both the administering of Zanda's finances in relationto the erection of the building, and the provision of funds for Zanda, insofar as the stage payments under the Agreement proved insufficientto pay the building contractor. Asean furnished loans to Zanda to make up the deficiency. In the fullness of time, Zanda would haveto pay them back, thereby making it not unnatural for Asean to be receiving money from Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> September 1981 was very close to the edge of the watershed between the boom in Hong Kong's real estate market, and the collapse whichsupervened. No doubt, the shareholders in Zanda at the time of making the sale to Tai Ting Estates were very pleased with themselvesat their profitable exploitation of the opportunities available in a rising real estate market. Little did they realize the rudeawakening they were to receive when the market turned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">I. <u>PERIOD FROM 3rd SEPTEMBER 1981 UP TO 7th SEPTEMBER 1983</u></p>    <p class="heading">A. <u>ECONOMITC BACKGROUND</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> The Agreement between Zanda and Tai Ting Estates must have been amongst the last of the profitable real estate transactions in HongKong before land prices started to suffer steep declines as boom turned to slump. When entering into that Agreement, Zanda had hopesof a profit in the vicinity of $14 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> The first indicators that all was not well in Hong Kong's real estate market occurred towards the end of 1981. By that stage, banksand D.T.C.s, through their lending policies, had created a vast balloon of credit which at some point was bound to burst. Between1978 and 1982, loans granted by banks to the property sector had jumped from $10,228 million to $47,578 million, that is to say,a more than four-fold increase. Lending by D.T.C.s over that period for real estate deals had increased nine-fold, from $2,48 millionto $21,064 million. Such a situation could only end in tears. During the year 1982, real estate prices tumbled by something like60 to 90 per cent from what, looking back, was the peak period of 1980 to 1981.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> Adding to the discomfiture of anyone who had borrowed to speculate on land was the phenomenon of record high interest rates in theearly 1980s. Anyone owing money to banks in respect of real estate dealings at a time of softening prices accompanied by rising interestrates is likely to find himself caught in a credit squeeze. That is what happened to Asean, as well as to many other D.T.C.s.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> As time was to show, many D.T.C.s, including Asean, had, by committing too high a proportion of their borrowings to real estate transactions,been guilty of the folly of having, in effect, too many eggs in one basket.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> The first publicly revealed casualty arising from Hong Kong's credit excesses of the previous four or five years was Tse Lee YuenJewellery Group, which went into liquidation in early September 1982 when it was no longer able to honour so-called "gold certificates",issued to many small investors who found out, too late, that there was nothing to back up the pieces of paper they were left holding.Soon after that, there was a run on one of the branches of Hang Lung Bank as the result of rumours that Hang Lung Bank had closeconnections with Tse Lee Yuen Jewellery Group. Because of the close connections between Hang Lung Bank, via Mr Johnny Cheng, andAsean, I think it safe to infer that at least a tiny amount of confidence in Asean must have been sapped on account of its majorHang Lung Bank connections.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> That all was far from well with registered D.T.C.s became manifest on the 15th November 1982 when Dollar Credit and Financing Limited("Dollar Credit"), one of the larger registered D.T.C.s, announced it could no longer meet its liabilities. From that time onwards,the writing was on the wall for D.T.C.s such as Asean which, as time would show, had played fast and loose with the money of thosefrom whom they had borrowed. A domino effect then set in with six more registered D.T.C. collapsing in the 4 months following theDollar Credit debacle. From late 1982 onwards, a whole host of highly leveraged companies which had dabbled in real estate startedgoing to the wall. Amongst the more notorious were Eda Investments and the Carrian Group.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> When Dollar Credit went under, doubts about the stability of Hang Lung Bank started to re-surface, because Hang Lung Bank had twodirectors who also served on the board of Dollar Credit. The resignation of those two directors from Hang Lung Bank must have gonesome way to restoring public confidence in Hang Lung Bank, but there must have been at least a modicum of damage done to Hang LungBank's reputation, and there would have been a ripple effect on Asean in which the ubiquitous Mr Johnny Cheng featured.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> To add to Hong Kong's economic woes, the question of what was to happen to Hong Kong when the lease of the New Territories ran outin 1997 started to obtrude in the public consciousness due to wide coverage of that issue in the media. Public concern on the topicof Hong Kong's future intensified throughout 1983, with a low point arriving in late September 1983 when there were wild currencygyrations. Confidence in Hong Kong's currency was restored by government's introduction of a currency "peg" linking the Hong Kongdollar to the United States dollar.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> On 30th June 1983 a two year breathing-space elapsed for registered D.T.C.s which, by amendments to the Deposit Taking <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> in mid-1981, had been required to increase their capital from the minimum $2.5 million allowed up until then to $10 million immediatelyafter June 30th 1983. Six registered D.T.C.s, failing to meet this $10 million capital requirement, automatically had their registrationsuspended on 1st July 1983. This, yet again, exposed the vulnerability of non-bank-owned-D.T.C.s. In July 1983 yet further adversepublicity for D.T.C.s arose when two more underwent de-registration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> By mid 1983, Hong Kong's land market had reached a chronically depressed condition, with unrelieved gloom about land prices havingexisted for over 18 months by then. A bright spot, at a time of many companies being driven into liquidation and many individualsfalling into bankruptcy because of their greed over former speculation in land, was Tai Ting Estates which, so the evidence beforeme suggested, never looked as if it would be in any difficulty when it came to the point of completion of its Agreement with Zanda.</p>    <p class="heading">B. <u>ACTIVITIES OF ZANDA, ASEAN, BANK OF AMERICA AND BARCLAYS</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> For the purposes of exposition, it is convenient to break up the period from 3rd September 1981 up to 7th September 1983 into twoparts - one up to and including 30th June 1983, and the other, from 1st July to 7th September 1983.</p>    <p class="heading">1. <u>Phase from 3rd September 1981 to 30th June 1983</u></p>    <p class="heading">i) <u>Zanda</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a> Looked at from Zanda's point of view, the period I am now considering was relatively uneventful. Work progressed on the buildingit was putting up for Tai Ting Estates. The reinforced concrete flooring of the 1st floor was completed by July 1982, triggeringthe first stage payment of $2.05 million. The cheque for that sum was indorsed over to Asean by the joint signatures of Mr JessePerez and Mr Eddie Leung on behalf of Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> By the 2nd September 1982, the 8th floor must have been completed, since, on that date, Zanda received a cheque for $2.05 million,being the second stage payment. That was indorsed to Asean by Mr S Y Ho, and Miss Carmencita Cheng.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> The 16th floor having been built, Zanda on 28th October 1982, received the third stage payment of $2.05 million. For the first time,a cheque was negotiated to Asean by Zanda on the signature of a sole director on behalf of Zanda, that director being Mr Jesse Perez.The proceeds of that cheque were collected for Asean by Bank of America. The officer in Bank of America who approved that collectionwas Mr Arthur Lee. It was he who, approximately ten months later, was to approve the collection of the fateful cheque for $5 million,dated 7th September 1983, in issue in the present proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> The flooring of the roof must have been finished by December 1982, since Zanda received the fourth stage payment that month. Thereis no dispute that cheque was indorsed over to Asean. Whether that indorsement was on the signature of Jesse Perez alone, or jointlywith Mr S.Y. Ho or Mr Eddie Leung from the O.C.I.L. side, is an area of penumbra, since none of the parties in the case has beenable to find a copy of the cheque. On the view I take, it is just as likely that the cheque was indorsed by Jesse Perez alone asit is that he indorsed it jointly with Mr S.Y. Ho or Mr Eddie Leung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> By March 1983, Zanda must have felt it was falling behind in the building work: it decided to offer the contractor, Ray-On Limited,("Ray-On"), an inducement to get the building finished before the 25th June 1983, when the 660 working days provided for under theAgreement between Zanda and Tai Ting Estates expired. The inducement took the form of paying Ray-On an extra $3,000 a day, so thatRay-On could pass that on to its workforce by way of overtime. As always, it was Mr Alexis Chan who arranged that. There was somedegree of involvement by Mr S.Y. Ho, too, since he joined with Mr Jesse Perez in passing a Zanda board resolution approving the extrapayment. At the same time, Zanda, with Mr S.Y. Ho's participation, approved guaranteeing a loan to Ray-On of $1 million from KinFung Hong, the family company of Mr Alexis Chan. Another similar loan of $1 million, with the same arrangements and parties, wasmade on 20th June 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> By late May 1983, one finds Mr S.Y. Ho, reasonably, expecting that the building will by then have been finished. On that day he wroteto Mr Alexis Chan at Asean in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Dear Alexis,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">I refer to our joint venture projects in Ming Fung Street, Kowloon and in Keelung, Taiwan.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">In the Ming Fung Street development, Ray On Construction Co.

At that time, a long list of different banks were only toohappy to lend Asean money for its business. Largest of all the lender-banks was Barclays, which extended facilities of US$22 millionto Asean. Some of that was secured, some not. The next biggest lender, Bank of America, granted Asean a lending-facility of approximatelyUS$8 million. Much of that was secured. There were at least ten other banks lending money to Asean. Much of that lending was doneon the basis of personal guarantees from Mr Johnny Cheng and Mr Alexis Chan, the two most influential figures in Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> The impression I get from the evidence as a whole is that, from the time Asean started business in 1979, right through until aboutthe last quarter of 1983, the major figures in Asean, namely, Mr Johnny Cheng, Mr Alexis Chan, and Mr Jesse Perez, (in descendingorder of importance), were regarded as men of complete probity, and so wealthy that any reasonable person would assume there wouldnever be any temptation for them to do anything dishonest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> Even as real estate prices dived sharply in 1982, Asean was still outwardly perceived by the financial community in Hong Kong asa stable, well-run company, the wealth of Mr Johnny Cheng, in particular, being a source of comfort to those lending to Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a> As early as April 1982, however, Mr Arthur Lee, the Account Officer handling Asean's account in Bank of America, did dimly perceivethat trouble could lie ahead for Asean because of its exposure to a softening real estate market, and a harsher regulatory climatefor registered D.T.C.s as the result of amendments made to the Ordinance in 1981.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a> Throughout 1982, I think that, in all probability, Mr Alexis Chan had no problem in raising finance for the Zanda development. Besidesthe money indorsed over to Asean from the $4.1 million deposit and the four stage payments of$2.05 million each from Tai Ting Estates,it is obvious, from the evidence as a whole, that Asean had to come up with additional money to finance the building for Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a> As a D.T.C., Asean infringed the Ordinance whenever it lent more than 25% of its own capital and reserves to anyone borrower. A provisionto that effect was in the Ordinance when first enacted in 1976, and, with increasing refinements introduced by way of legislativeamendment, has remained a part of the legislation to this day. Asean, through its Managing Director, Mr Alexis Chan, had lent Zandasums of money considerably in excess of 25% of Asean's capital and reserves. Mr Alexis Chan evaded the D.T.C. legislation by thesimple expedient of having a dummy company appear to lend money to Zanda. The dummy company brought into being by Mr Alexis Chanfor this purpose was Clyde Investments Ltd ("Clyde Investments").</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a> Clyde Investments features as an indorsee on the three cheques for stage payments of $2.05 million each, regarding which the courthas copies. As likely as not, Clyde Investments was also an indorsee on the missing cheque for $2.05millibn relating to the fourthstage payment. Nothing turns on whether Clyde was shown as an indorsee on that fourth stage-payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="pseudopara" id="p129">129.</a> Besides Clyde, the other indorsee on the stage-payment cheques was Asean. As far as I can make out from the photostat copies of thethree cheques for stage payments put in evidence, each indorsement on behalf of either Clyde Investments or Asean is on the strengthof a single signature.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="pseudopara" id="p130">130.</a> Arthur Lee was the Account Officer who approved the collection by Bank of America of two of the three stage payments in relationto which the court has copies. I have previously mentioned how it was Mr Arthur Lee who approved the collection by Bank of Americaon the 7th September 1983 of the $5 million cheque in issue. I have also mentioned how he had at least once previously approved thecollection for Asean of a Zanda cheque where Mr Jesse Perez was the sole indorsee on behalf of Zanda. That was the cheque for thethird stage payment of$2.05 million, dated 28th, October, 1982. That cheque, too, had an indorsement by way of a single signatureon behalf of Asean. Thus, when Mr Arthur Lee, on the 7th September 1983, approved collection of the $5 million cheque in issue, hewas no stranger to cheques made payable to Zanda being indorsed over on the strength of a single signature on behalf of Zanda, andanother single signature on behalf of Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="pseudopara" id="p131">131.</a> Although there is nothing to indicate Asean experienced any difficulty in 1982 in raising finance for the Zanda, building, I do notdoubt that the suspension of-Dollar Credit as a registered D.T.C. on 15th November 1982 must have sent a shiver through Mr JohnnyCheng, Mr Alexis Chan, Mr Jesse Perez and anyone else privy to the dishonest way in which Asean ran its business. I think that, inall probability, some of the overseas banks lending to Asean would immediately have terminated their facility as soon as the newsof the Dollar Credit suspension broke. Asean, like Dollar Credit, fell into the category of non-bank owned registered D.T.C.s lackingthe depths of reserves associated with bank-owned registered D.T.C.s. Those running Asean must have felt that the credit-owned registeredD.T.C.s. Those running Asean must have felt that the credit-corset was tightening on them as banks withdrew lending facilities, andwhile borrowing prospects for Asean could not have looked good from the point of view of those running Asean as at the end of 1982,the situation was not yet critical.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="pseudopara" id="p132">132.</a> With each item of bad news in the first half of 1983, such as for example, the suspension of yet another registered D.T.C. or thecalling in of receivers for a land development company, say, the liquidity crisis for Asean and those running it must have becomemore acute.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="pseudopara" id="p133">133.</a> One bright spot for Asean as June 1983 drew to a close must have been the prospect of its share of the profit from the Zanda developmentit was soon due to garner.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">iii) <u>Bank of America</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="pseudopara" id="p134">134.</a> It is difficult to determine precisely how much credit Bank of America granted to Asean in the period from 3<sup>rd</sup> September 1981 up until November 1982 when the news of Dollar Creditsâs collapse broke. A bewildering array of different figuresrelating to the grant of credit-lines to Asean from Bank of America are dotted around in a variety of material emanating from Bankof America in respect of the period I am now considering. A further complication is introduced by the fact that Bank of Americaâscredit lines to Asean are shown in at least three different currencies, namely, HK dollars, US dollars and Singapore dollars, allof which, at that time, were freely floating in relation to each other. The value of any security from Asean at any particular timewas far from clear to the Court. The general impression I get in respect of this period from September 1981 up until November 1982is that Bank of Americaâs unsecured loan facilities to Asean were of the order of from HK$20 million to HK$30 million. Nothingturns on knowing the precise amount of Bank of Americaâs unsecured exposure to Asean during that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="pseudopara" id="p135">135.</a> Already I have noted how, as early as April 1982, on the occasion of making a routine annual assessment of its customer, Bank ofAmerica had slight reservations about Asean's financial prospects. In that annual assessment, it was noted that amendments to theOrdinance requiring that registered D.T.C.s after June 1983 would no longer be allowed to accept loans from the public of a maturityof less than 3 months, would make the business climate less favourable for such D.T.C.s. Also, reference was made to declining realestate values which might cause problems for Asean. Bank of America knew Asean to have advanced money for real estate transactions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="pseudopara" id="p136">136.</a> From at least July 1982, Bank of America knew the shareholders and officers of Zanda from a search it caused to be conducted againstthat company at the Companies' Registry. This was done to follow up a reference in Asean's annual audited financial statements whichshowed that, besides its interest in Zanda, Asean was also involved in a real estate development in Taiwan. While knowing that Aseanowned no more than 50% of the shares in Zanda, Bank of America's officers saw that, in fact, it was Asean, the largest shareholder,which, through Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez, was actively managing the Zanda development. Bank of America knew, too, that Aseanwas financing the development by loans as a shareholder. Bank of America, undoubtedly, would also have known that O.C.I.L. and Northbournehad made shareholder-loans to Zanda, but their loans remained at the same level as they had been at the time when Zanda purchasedthe Ming Fung Street property, whereas the loans made by Asean, either directly or indirectly, had increased as the Zanda developmentprogressed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a> As soon as Bank of America learnt about the Dollar Credit collapse on 15th November 1982, it reacted swiftly and decisively. Bankof America realized that Asean was basically in the same boat as Dollar Credit in that neither of them was bank-owned and both ofthem had lent to the high risk end of the market.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a> Mr Hemholz, Bank of America's Vice-President in Hong Kong in charge of credit policy, consistently adopted the stance that no newcredit was to be extended to Asean, and any existing credit lines were to be cut off unless Asean could come up with adequate security.At the time of the Dollar Credit collapse, Asean's borrowing from Bank of America, not backed by adequate security, was in the $20to $30 million range.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a> The impression I get from the somewhat confusing Bank of America documentation is that Bank of America terminated one line of creditfor about $14 million before the end of December 1982.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a> Despite Mr Hemholz's declared policy of more or less immediately terminating any credit line for Asean which lacked adequate collateralbacking, Bank of America, in practice, did not act as drastically against Asean as one might have expected from the way Mr Hemholzwas writing. Part of the explanation for why Bank of America's deeds did not match Mr Hemholz's word is probably that Bank of Americawas impressed by the efforts Mr Alexis Chan made to co-operate with Bank of America in reducing Asean's debt to Bank of America inan orderly way. By drawing on the resources of his family's company, Kin Fung Hong, Mr Alexis Chan was, in December 982; able tohand over to Bank of America a time deposit of about $15 million in favour of Kin Fung Hong. That time deposit was not actually pledgedto Bank of America, but it gave Bank of America comfort to know that Mr Alexis Chan's family still had substantial assets, the certificateof deposit being an example.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="pseudopara" id="p141">141.</a> During the first quarter of 1983, continuous but polite pressure was exerted by Bank of America on Asean to reduce its outstandingborrowings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="pseudopara" id="p142">142.</a> For reasons not entirely clear, Bank of America, in practice, allowed Asean to drift on until June 1983 with part of its outstandingloan from Bank of America still unsecured. In early January 1983, one sees Mr Hemhplz continuing his refrain that unless securitywas provided by Asean, Bank of America should cancel any uncovered loan. As late as April 1983, Mr Arthur Lee was proposing to hissuperiors that Asean's revolving-credit for $27 million should be renewed, provided sufficient security was forthcoming. However,an event had occurred shortly before that which brought home to those responsible for supervising Asean's account with Bank of Americathat the time had arrived to discontinue credit to Asean. That event was Asean, on 31st March 1983, for the first time, defaultingon an obligation to Bank of America by failing to meet a deadline for the repayment of $2 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="pseudopara" id="p143">143.</a> Mr Arthur Lee's suggestion to his superiors in mid-April 1983 that there should be a renewal of the revolving-credit for Asean wasswept aside, in favour of a policy requiring Asean to repay all its debts to Bank of America within a period of a few months.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="pseudopara" id="p144">144.</a> Although it was undoubtly serious for a financial institution in the nature of a secondary bank such as Asean to default over a payment,I accepted the evidence of Mr Arthur Lee that the circumstances surrounding this default did not point to the possibilty Asean mightbe insolvent, and even less did it suggest that there might be something dishonourable about those running Asean. As Bank of Americaperceived the position at the time, Asean was experiencing a liquidity problem brought about by having assets such as land whichcould not be disposed of quickly enough to settle its debts on time. On the other hand, though, there can be no doubt that from theend of March 1983 onwards, Bank of America regarded Asean's business as highly risky, and was anxious to get repayment as soon aspossible. Certainly, from about the end of April or the beginning of May 1983, it is clear that the Bank of America had firmly madeup its mind to cut off Asean's credit, after allowing Asean a few months grace to make repayment in full. The actual mechanics involvedin Bank of America's cutting off credit to Asean was to cancel Asean's revolving-credit, and replace it with a short term advancewhich Asean was required to pay by instalments.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="pseudopara" id="p145">145.</a> Looking at Aseanâs position on the 18<sup>th</sup> June 1983, it owed Bank of America approximately $27 million, of which approximately $11 million was secured by certificates of deposit,leaving an unsecured balance of approximately HK$16 million. To eliminate that debt, Bank of America required Asean to sign promissorynotes for the following amounts and maturities:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">$8.25 million 14<sup>th</sup> July 1983</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">$5,714,514 on 29<sup>th</sup> July 1983</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">$5 million on 30<sup>th</sup> August 1983</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">$5 million on 30<sup>th</sup> September 1983.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="pseudopara" id="p146">146.</a> Part of the monies comprised within those promissory notes was secured by certificates of deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="pseudopara" id="p147">147.</a> Bank of America, somewhat euphemistically, described this process as a "re-scheduling" of its loans to Asean, but there can be nodoubt, as those appearing for Zanda asserted, that the exercise embarked upon by Bank of America was its requiring Asean to liquidateall its borrowings within a period of approximately three month, expiring at the end of September 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="pseudopara" id="p148">148.</a> Viewed at the end of June 1983, relations between Bank of America and Asean remained amicable. Mr Alexis Chan continued to co-operatefully with Bank of America, and showed that he was doing his level best to see that Bank of America got paid. Neither he nor Mr JessePerez had, at that stage, done anything to Bank of America's knowledge which might have led Bank of America to regard them as trickyor unreliable. At worst, Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez could have been regarded as a little foolish by Bank of America for overstretchingthemselves financially, but, in this, they were no worse, to outward appearances, than a whole bevy of other Hong Kong businessmen,assisted by banks, who had forgotten that booms are invariably followed by slumps. Illiquidity was no indicator of illegality.</p>    <p>(iv) <u>Barclays</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="pseudopara" id="p149">149.</a> No one was available on Barclays' behalf to speak about what was happening between Barclays and Asean during the period from 3rdSeptember 1981 up until the Dollar Credit bombshell on 15th November 1982. Judging from the absence of panic on the part of Barclayswhen the news of Dollar Credit's demise broke, I regard it as reasonable to assume that Barclays must have been happy with the wayAsean had conducted its account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p150" class="pseudopara" id="p150">150.</a> Whereas Mr Helmholzl, on behalf of Bank of America, unswervingly pursued a policy aimed at cancelling Asean's credit-lines, Barclaystook a comparatively casual approach. It is not easy to tell from the documentary evidence how much Asean owed Barclays without security.I gather from the evidence generally that it must have been in the $50 million region.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p151" class="pseudopara" id="p151">151.</a> Some pressure was brought to bear by Barclays on Asean to reduce one credit line from approximately $33 million to $27 million inNovember/December 1982, the effect being that Asean towards the end of December 1982 did pay down its debts to Barclays by over $5million, but, generally, Barclays' staff in Hong Kong give the impression, from what they were committing to paper at the time, thatthey were not unduly worried about Asean's debts to their bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p152" class="pseudopara" id="p152">152.</a> What comes across when reading reports from Barclays' Hong Kong staff is that, in their eyes, Asean was a well-run company, headedup by able and honest people.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p153" class="pseudopara" id="p153">153.</a> Barclays' head office in London did not share the equanimity of those running the Hong Kong operation. It is quite extraordinaryhow the Barclays' people in London, eight thousand miles away, as early as the 14th January 1983, woke up to what Asean's problemsprobably were, whereas the Hong Kong staff, on the spot, appeared blissfully unaware of what might ail their customer. I set outLondon's prescient letter of 14th January 1983 to the Hong Kong manager of Barclays:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"The General Manager in Hong Kong</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Hong Kong</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><u>ASEAN MERCHANT CREDIT AND INVESTMENT HOUSE LTD</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Thank you for your letter of 16th December 1982 with which you enclosed Balance Sheets and Accounts for the above Company.

All that Zanda needed do now to become entitled to receive the $28.7 million balanceof the purchase money from Tai Ting Estates was to have the Building Authority issue the Occupation Permit for the building.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p155" class="pseudopara" id="p155">155.</a> The Building Authority issued the Occupation Permit on 6th August 1983. Both Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez knew that straightaway, but refrained from passing on that information to Mr S Y Ho or Mr Eddie Leung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p156" class="pseudopara" id="p156">156.</a> Mr Alexis Chan and/or Mr Jesse Perez straight away informed Tai Ting Estates that the Occupation Permit had been issued. Mr AlexisChan and/or Mr Jesse Perez let Tai Ting Estates know they would like to complete as soon as possible. Tai Ting Estates, which alreadyhad the funds available, indicated its willingness to go along with their wishes. Tai Ting Estates then caused its solicitors, MessrsTsang, Chow &amp; Shuen, which were also Zanda's solicitors, to release the completion monies to Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p157" class="pseudopara" id="p157">157.</a> On behalf of Tai Ting Estates, Messrs Tsang, Chau &amp; Shuen had placed the funds for completing the purchase on deposit with variousbanks. One such deposit was for $10 million with Citibank. On 9th August 1983, Messrs Tsang, Chau &amp; Shuen sent Zanda, at itsregistered office, which was, of course, Asean's actual office, a cheque of that date, drawn on Citibank, for $10 million, made payableto Zanda. As I described earlier, that cheque bore the crossing on its face, "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only" and the printed words"or bearer" were deleted after the payee's name. On receipt of that cheque at Zanda's/Asean's office that same day, Mr Jesse Perezsigned the back of the cheque where the Zanda chop was applied. As I have previously explained, that chop reproduced a dotted linewith the words, "Zanda Investments Ltd." above, and the words, "Authorized Signature", below. Assuming for the time being that thesole signature of a director or alternate director was sufficient to constitute a valid indorsement on behalf of Zanda, the indorsementin the form I have just described would amount to an indorsement in blank. The chop of Asean was also stamped on the back of thecheque. That had a single signature, namely, that of Mr Titus Lee, the Chief Assistant Manager of Asean. That cheque was, the sameday, paid into Asean's account with Hang Lung Bank which collected the proceeds for Asean from Citibank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p158" class="pseudopara" id="p158">158.</a> Since more than $10 million was due from Zanda to Asean, Zanda now makes no complaint about Asean receiving that particular sum,though Zanda, nonetheless, contends that a purported indorsement by a single director of Zanda was ineffectual, legally.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p159" class="pseudopara" id="p159">159.</a> Still unbeknown to Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung at the time, Messrs Tsang, Chau &amp; Shuen sent a further $4.5 million to Zanda/Aseanon 24th August 1983. That took the form of one cashier-order for $2 million and another for $2.5 million in favour of Zanda as payee.There is no need to go into the details of those two cashier-orders, other than to note that each of them was indorsed in blank byMr Jesse Perez who had Zanda's chop applied, and then they were indorsed by Mr Alexis Chan who had them paid into his own personalaccount with Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. (ABN).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p160" class="pseudopara" id="p160">160.</a> There still remained $14.2 million of the purchase money outstanding. Three cheques in respect of that amount were sent by MessrsTsang, Chau &amp; Shuen to ZandalAsean on 7th September 1983. Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung were still in the dark then about whatwas happening in relation to the Zanda completion. Each of those three cheques followed the familiar pattern of being crossed "NotNegotiable A/C Payee Only" and the printed words "or bearer" were deleted after Zanda's name as payee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p161" class="pseudopara" id="p161">161.</a> One cheque was for $8.2 million drawn on O.T.B. Again, there was a purported indorsement in blank on behalf of Zanda, the signatorythis time being Ms. Stephenie Chan, at that time alternate director to Mr Jesse Perez. Mr Jesse Perez was out of the office whenthe cheque arrived. Mr Alexis Chan was there, though. On his instructions, she indorsed the cheque by signing where the Zanda chopwas stamped on the bank. Mr Alexis Chan then paid the cheque into his own personal current account with A.B.N. which collected the$8.2 million proceeds for him. (At this point it is convenient to note that Zanda sued A.B.N. in respect of its collecting the $4.5million in respect of the two cashier orders of 23rd August 1983 and the cheque for $8.2 million of 7th September 1983 for Mr AlexisChan's personal account. Unsurprisingly, that claim was settled by ABN which had fallen into the classic negligence trap of collectinga cheque payable to a corporation for a private individual, the actual settlement figure paid to Zanda being $12 million, which includedZanda's costs.)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p162" class="pseudopara" id="p162">162.</a> Attention can now be focused on the other two cheques dated 7th September 1983 and received by Zanda/Asean on that day. The largerof the two cheques was for $5 million drawn on American Express Bank. That cheque's number was 269602. That is the cheque which wascollected by Bank of America, and gives rise to the present action against that bank. It was crossed "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only",with the printed words "or bearerâ deleted, and was indorsed by Ms Stephenie Chan, on behalf of Zanda, on the direction of Mr AlexisChan. The cheque also was indorsed on behalf of Asean by Mr Titus Lee, the Chief Assistant Manager of Asean. How Bank of Americadealt with that cheque when it was presented for collection that same day is a topic I will explore later under sub-heading (iii),â Bank of Americaâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a> The other cheque, being No. 016871, was drawn on Barclaysâ Causeway Bay Branch in favour of Zanda, and had the same crossings,deletions and indorsments as the $5 million cheque I have just described. This $1 million cheque was presented on behalf of Aseanto Barclaysâ Gloucester Tower Branch for collection on behalf of Asean that same day. I will consider how Barclays dealt with thatcheque when I come to subheading (iv), âBarclaysâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a> As at the 7<sup>th</sup> September 1983, I am satisfied that Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung still did not know that the Occupation Permit had been issued forthe Ming Fat Street premises, and, therefore, did not at the time know that completion took place between the 9<sup>th</sup> August 1983 and 7<sup>th</sup> September 1983 by Tai Ting Estates paying Zanda the full balance of the purchase money.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p165" class="pseudopara" id="p165">165.</a> With some audacity, Mr Alexis Chan, on the 6<sup>th</sup> September 1983, got Mr S.Y. Ho, as a director of Zanda, to sign a power of attorney from Zanda to Tai Ting Estates for the purposeof endabling Tai Ting Estates to make sub-sales. That must have been an indication to Mr S.Y. Ho that completion of the sale fromZanda to Tai Ting Estates was imminent, but I accept that Mr Alexis Chan must have fobbed him off with a story about government delayshoding up the Occupation Permit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a> I have no doubt that, as at the 7<sup>th</sup> September, 1983, Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung intended that any cheque or cheques payable to Zanda in respect of the completionmonies would be indorsed over to Asean for collection through an Asean bank account, after which Asean would in due course accountto O.C.I.L and Northbourne by paying O.C.I.L. and Northbourne their share of the profits. If Mr S.Y. Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung hadbeen contacted by either Bank of America and/or of Barclays on the 7th September 1983, asking if it was alright to collect the Zandacheques of that date for the $5 million and $1 million, respectively, for Asean, I do not doubt that both would have agreed withalacrity. They would have assumed that, at long last, the Occupation Permit had been issued, and that the balance of the purchasemonies was being paid in more than one lot. If Mr S.Y. Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung had contacted either Mr Alexis Chan or Mr Jesse Perez,in both of whom they obviously had great faith, Mr Alexis Chan and/or Mr Jesse Perez would, no doubt, have lied, making out thatthe two cheques in issue, received on the 7th September 1983, were the first payments of the $28.7 million balance of the purchasemoney, rather than the last.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii) <u>ASEAN</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a> On 1st July 1983, the first day of the period I am now considering, the law changed so that a registered D.T.C., such as Asean, couldreceive deposits only if they were for a minimum period of three months. That change had been in the pipe-line since mid-1981.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a> By the beginning of July 1983, Asean was in a desperate plight, financially. For over seven and a half months by then â ever sincethe Dollar Credit crisis the previous November - creditor banks had been forcing Asean to reduce, or wholly pay off, its borrowings.In a badly depressed land market, Asean was holding substantial loans in respect of real estate. In particular, there was the sumof $63 million advanced to a Mr Henry Hung for land speculation. At about this time, one can see, from the evidence which emergedabout the situations with Bank of America arid Barclays, how Mr Alexis Chan had to juggle with his few sound assets to keep Asean'screditors at bay. The lies told by Mr Alexis Chan and/or Mr Jesse Perez to Mr S.Y.Ho and/or Mr Eddie Leung after the 6th August 1983about the Occupation Permit still not having been issued were part of a dangerous game played by Mr Alexis Chan and/or Mr Jesse Perezin the nature of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Obviously, the truth about when completion in fact took place was bound in due courseto become known by Mr S. Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung, but, by then, Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez were, no doubt, hoping that somethingwould have turned up, so that they could repay O.C.I.L.'s and Northbourne's loans as well as paying their share of the profit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a> The deception practised by Mr Alexis Chan on the Bank of America was basically the same as the one he used in relation to Mr S.Y.Ho, except that in addition to the part about waiting for the Occupation Permit, he concocted a variation about a "Letter of Compliance",which was supposed to be holding up receipt of purchase monies for Asean arising from the Zanda development.</p>    <p class="heading">(iii) <u>Bank of America</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a> Bank of America's concerned staff generally, and Mr Arthur Lee, its Account Officer for Asean, in particular, had known from at leastJuly 1982 that Asean was managing the development of Zanda's Ming Fung Street property, and was furnishing loans to Zanda for thatpurpose. Because of the way in which Bank of America's Account Officers closely monitored customers owing money to their bank, Iam sure that Mr Arthur Lee and his superiors had a good idea of the progress being made on the erection by Zanda of the buildingfor Tai Ting Estates.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a> Throughout July 1983, Mr Arthur Lee, who, at that time, was keeping a very close eye on Asean, must have been aware that the buildingwas more or less finished, and that payment for it would be coming up soon.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p172" class="pseudopara" id="p172">172.</a> On the 29th July, 1983 Asean was supposed to repay Bank of America $5,714,514 under the second of the promissory notes signed byAsean towards the end of June 1983, but defaulted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p173" class="pseudopara" id="p173">173.</a> No doubt to placate Bank of America, which was clamouring for payment under that second promissory note, Mr Alexis Chan informedMr Arthur Lee on the 5th August, 1983 that the Occupation Permit for Zanda's building would be issued on the 10th August, with theresult that $10 million from the completion monies would become available to pay Bank of America by the 17th August 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p174" class="pseudopara" id="p174">174.</a> It might well be that, at the moment of informing Mr Arthur Lee about that, Mr Alexis Chan really did intend to pass on $10 millionof the completion money to Bank of America on or about the 17th August. However, the 17th August came and went without Mr AlexisChan choosing to pay $10 million to Bank of America, despite Asean's having collected that amount from the cheque in Zanda's favourof 9th August 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p175" class="pseudopara" id="p175">175.</a> It would have been on or shortly after the 17th August 1983 that Mr Alexis Chan dreamt up the idea of fobbing off Bank of Americawith the story about completion now being delayed pending the issue of a Letter of Compliance by government in respect of the Zandabuilding.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p176" class="pseudopara" id="p176">176.</a> At the same time as telling Bank of America the story about the Letter of Compliance on or about 17th August 1983, Mr Alexis Chanalso promised it that Asean would, in any event, pay in $2 to $3 million before the end of August 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p177" class="pseudopara" id="p177">177.</a> Not only did Mr Alexis Chan fail to pay any $2 to $3 million to Bank of America before the end of August 1983, but also Asean defaultedon the third of the promissory notes when it failed to pay the $5 million due under it to Bank of America on 30th August. By thattime, therefore, Asean had defaulted on the promissory note for $5,714,514 due on the 29th July, the $5 million due on the 30th August,and the $2 - $3 million which Mr Alexis Chan had promised before the end of August. These defaults were occurring at a time whenthe Hong Kong economy was looking more sick than ever.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p178" class="pseudopara" id="p178">178.</a> In late August, early September 1983, Mr Alexis Chan promised Mr Arthur Lee that a payment of $5 million in favour of Asean wouldbe shortly made to Asean from a source other than Zanda. That $5 million was due to arrive before the 15th September, according toMr Alexis Chan. At the same time, he also repeated his assertion that Bank of America would be paid $10 million from the Zanda completionmonies which would be released as soon as the Letter of Compliance was issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p179" class="pseudopara" id="p179">179.</a> Obviously, Mr Arthur Lee, for Bank of America, was anxious to receive payments from Asean in reduction of the outstanding loans,but I am satisfied that he still thought that Asean's problem was merely one of liquidity, and he was confident that the Bank ofAmerica would in due course make full recovery from Asean. He still had great faith in the value of the personal guarantee for $26.5million from Mr Johnny Cheng.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p180" class="pseudopara" id="p180">180.</a> Under sub-heading (i) above relating to Zanda I have already described how Mr Alexis Chan directed Ms Stephenie Chan on behalf ofZanda to indorse the cheque for $5 million received for Zanda on 7th September 1983. The cheque was also indorsed on behalf of Aseanby Mr Titus Lee, Asean's assistant general manager.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p181" class="pseudopara" id="p181">181.</a> That cheque, with the indorsement I have described, was presented on 7th September at Bank of America's counter to a teller who referredit to Mr Arthur Lee for approval. As I have mentioned, Mr Arthur Lee had been told by Mr Alexis Chan a few days earlier, in effect,to expect a cheque for $5 million from a source other than Zanda, and a cheque for $10 million from Zanda. Instead of either of those,Mr Arthur Lee now found this cheque for $5 million from Zanda being presented. Without making any reference to Asean or Zanda, MrArthur Lee went straight ahead and approved the collection of that cheque for Asean, immediately crediting Asean's current accountwith the $5 million, thereby reducing Asean's overdraft from $6,259,079 to $1,259,079.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p182" class="pseudopara" id="p182">182.</a> I am satisfied that, as at the moment when Mr Arthur Lee. approved the collection of that cheque on 7th September 1983, he genuinelybelieved it was part of the proceeds arising from the sale by Zanda of the Ming Fung Street property, and I regard it, in the lightof the circumsances known to Mr Arthur Lee at the 7th September, as reasonable for Mr Arthur Lee to have held that belief then.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p183" class="pseudopara" id="p183">183.</a> True, the Zanda cheque he was now approving was for $5 million only, whereas Mr Alexis Chan had promised $10 million from that source.Just because Asean, through the action of Mr Alexis Chan, was trying to pay in only $5 million from Zanda when $10 million had beenpromised, was not an indicator, in my view, that Mr Alexis Chan was untrustworthy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p184" class="pseudopara" id="p184">184.</a> Mr Arthur Lee was only too aware of Asean's chronic liquidity problem, which made it reasonable for Mr Arthur Lee to believe, ineffect, that Asean could only come up with this smaller amount because of its need to keep other, equally pressing, creditors happy.There was also the point that Mr Arthur Lee did not know as at the 7th September 1983 whether Tai Ting Estates would pay the balanceof the purchase money in one lot or several lots. In fact, Tai Ting Estates had paid the balance of the purchase money on three differentoccasions, employing six different cheques or money-orders, as I have already described.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p185" class="pseudopara" id="p185">185.</a> When he approved collection of the cheque, Mr Arthur Lee noticed the signature purporting to be that of Miss Stephenie Chan, a womanwhom he knew to be the personal secretary to Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez. He did not know her signature, since he had neverseen anything signed by her before, and he did not know that she was an alternate director and/or a signatory for Zanda. From thelittle he knew of her, he had no reason to doubt her honesty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p186" class="pseudopara" id="p186">186.</a> Another factor operating on Mr Arthur Lee's mind on that occasion on 7th September 1983 was his recognition of the signature of MrTitus Lee by way of indorsement on behalf of Asean. As he trusted those running Asean at that time, it was reasonable for him tothink that Asean would not be a party to any dishonest conduct by way of wrongfully diverting money from Zarida so that Asean couldmisuse the proceeds.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p187" class="pseudopara" id="p187">187.</a> For the purpose of considering whether Bank of America was negligent in collecting that $5 million for Asean on 7th September 1983,it is not permissible to be wise after the event by looking at what happend later.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p188" class="pseudopara" id="p188">188.</a> On or about the 13th September 1983, information came Mr Arthur Lee's way from Mr Alexis Chan indicating that none of the completionmonies would have been paid yet, since the Letter of Compliance was still awaited and had to be issued before Tai Ting Estates couldbe required to pay. If Mr Arthur Lee had had the mentality of a detective, Mr Alexis Chan's line of talk on the 13th September 1983would have alerted him to their being something suspicious about the Zanda $5 million cheque of the 7th September. However, a carefulbanker, a category in which I include Mr Arthur Lee, would not, on 13th September 1983, have started thinking in terms of his customerbeing a thief. More likely, he would probably have rationalized that Zanda had somehow managed to get Tai Ting Estates to pay upsome of the completion monies early. Although, as at 13th September 1983, there did emerge this evidence that in some puzzling wayAsean had been able to receive Zanda's cheque arising from the completion monies at a time when Zanda was not entitled to such moniesbecause of the outstanding Letter of Compliance, there was, however, nothing odd about Zanda's and/or Asean's position, as it hadbeen reasonably perceived by Mr Arthur Lee, as at 7th September 1983.</p>    <p class="heading">(iv) <u>Barclays Bank</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p189" class="pseudopara" id="p189">189.</a> Although the manager of the Causeway Bay Branch of Barclays where Asean had an account probably knew from Asean's financial statementsfor 1981/82 that Zanda was. a company in which Asean had a 50% stake, there is nothing, however, on the evidence to show that MrAlexis Chan or anyone else in Asean laid any ground work before 7th September 1983 which might have made it reasonable for Barclaysto expect that Asean would be receiving a legitimate payment from Zanda on or around that date, stemming from Asean's financing abuilding sold by Zanda. No one actually handling Asean's accounts for Barclays during this period was available as a witness; aswith the earlier and later phases, the court had only the contemporary letters and memoranda from Barclays' staff, plus the evidenceof Mr Stephen Leung, a senior manager in Barclays, who was able to tell the court about Barclays' normal practices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p190" class="pseudopara" id="p190">190.</a> It is clear that during the phase now under consideration, Barclays was applying some pressure on Mr Alexis Chan to reduce the unsecuredborrowings of Asean, but this pressure was relatively mild and intermittent. One way in which Barclays reduced the credit-facilitiesavailable to Asean was by Barclays declining to allow itself to be used as a clearing bank for third party cheques indorsed overto Asean. A totally fair question asked by those appearing on behalf of Zanda has been, "Why should Barclays have made an exceptionfor the third party cheque for $1 million payable to Zanda it collected on 7th September 1983?"</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p191" class="pseudopara" id="p191">191.</a> The general impression given me by the evidence is that Barclays Hong Kong, without feeling any great anxiety about their customer,allowed Asean to coast along with unsecured indebtedness of about $50 million during the phase I am now considering.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p192" class="pseudopara" id="p192">192.</a> On or about the 14th July 1983, Mr Peart, a Barclays manager, had been promised by Mr Alexis Chan that Asean would reduce its borrowingsby $3 million before the end of that month, and a further $5 million before the end of the following month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p193" class="pseudopara" id="p193">193.</a> The $3 million reduction in July was supposed to occur on the 25th of that month when a borrowing facility of $15 million fell duefor renewal. Mr Alexis Chan had indicated that Asean would pay in $3 million to Barclays, so that only $12 million by way of loanwould need to be rolled-over on the 25th July. The 25th of July came and went without any $3 million, or any lesser sum, being paidin by Asean. Mr Peart got Mr Alexis Chan to call at the manager's office for a talking-to on the 5th August 1983 when Mr Alexis Chanpromised to pay $2 million by the end of the following week, and a further $2 million before the end of August. The first $2 millionwas in fact paid-in on or about the 11th August, and on that occasion Mr Alexis Chan informed Mr Peart that over the following twelvemonths Asean expected to reduce its indebtedness to Barclays at the rate of $2 million per month. Instead of paying the further $2million promised before the end of August. Asean paid in $1 million on the 26th August, accompanied by Mr Alexis Chan's promise ofthe payment of another $1 million before the end of August. Mr Alexis Chan's promise of the 14th July 1983 to reduce Asean's indebtednessby a payment of $5 million before the end of August seems to have been forgotten by Barclays.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p194" class="pseudopara" id="p194">194.</a> After the payment of the $1 million on 26th August 1983, the next money Barclays received from Asean was the $1 million collectedby it on the 7th September 1983 in respect of the cheque made payable to Zanda, and purportedly indorsed over to Asean by Ms StephenieChan's sole signature on behalf of Zanda, and Mr Titus Lee's indorsement for Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p195" class="pseudopara" id="p195">195.</a> Although Asean kept failing to fulfill the promises of payment made by Mr Alexis Chan to Barclays, the evidence, as a whole, showsclearly that Barclays continued to trust Mr Alexis Chan and Asean by rolling-over loans to Asean as they fell due. Had Barclays nottrusted Asean and Mr Alexis Chan, it would, presumably, not have hesitated to call in its loans. In all probability, Barclays, likeBank of America, did not feel that the honour and integrity of Mr Alexis Chan and those running Asean were put in question simplybecause Asean failed, at a time when its liquidity was tight, to meet promises of payment. From the contemporary written materialof Barclays' officers in Hong Kong, it is clear they thought Asean had a viable business which was likely to weather the financialcrisis engulfing D.T.C.s at the time I am now considering. There is nothing in any of the material before me to suggest that anyof the Barclays officers in Hong Kong concerned with Asean's account had the slightest suspicion that any of those running Aseanwere in any way dishonest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p196" class="pseudopara" id="p196">196.</a> As previously indicated, the $1 million cheque now being considered was paid into the Gloucester Tower Branch of Barclays. I thinkit reasonable to assume that the Gloucester Tower Branch would have contacted the Causeway Bay Branch where Asean had its accountto find out whether the Causeway Bay Branch regarded the proposed collection of this cheque for Asean as a reasonable step to take.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p197" class="pseudopara" id="p197">197.</a> Barclays' decision to approve this collection of $1 million is in some ways harder to defend than Bank of America's decision thesame day to collect the larger amount of $5 million on a Zanda cheque. Bank of America had extensive knowledge of the underlyingtransaction, whereas there is nothing to show that Barclays knew anything about how Asean had come by this $1 million cheque fromZanda. On the other hand, however, the amount Barclays was being asked to collect was rather small in comparison with the creditBarclays was willing to continue for Asean, and also small in relation to the massive turnover of Asean's business.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p198" class="pseudopara" id="p198">198.</a> There is the point, of course, that Barclays had generally stopped collecting third party cheques for Asean, making it legitimateto wonder if Barclays, by 7th September 983, had decided to throw caution to the wind because of the intensifying financial crisisin Hong Kong at the time, and took an unreasonable risk at Zanda's expense.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p199" class="pseudopara" id="p199">199.</a> On balance, I think that what Barclays did was just about reasonable. I have more reservations about the way it acted than I do aboutBank of America in relation to the cheque the latter collected that day. A point, though, that swings the balance entirely in Barclays'favour is that if it had phoned up any of Mr S.Y. Ho, Mr Eddie Leung, Mr Jesse Perez, Ms Stephenie Chan, or Mr Alexis Chan on thatday to enquire about the cheque, I do not doubt that each and every one of them would have said it was in order for Asean to collectthe proceeds of that $1 million cheque on behalf of Zanda. This is a point on which I will comment further when I come to deal withcausation in the context of how negligence affects a collecting banker seeking to avoid liability for wrongful conversation of acheque by resort to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">II. <u>PERIOD 8TH SEPTEMBER 1983 ONWARDS.</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">A. <u>Economic Background</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p200" class="pseudopara" id="p200">200.</a> Hong Kong's economy, and, with it, the land market, remained in the doldrums until at least 1985.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p201" class="pseudopara" id="p201">201.</a> One of the severest tests to which the Hong Kong economy has ever been subjected took place in September 1983 when the Hong Kongdollar went into a tailspin brought on by doubts about Hong Kong's political future. On September 23rd and 24th, 1983, the exchangerate of the HK$ in terms of the US$ fell some 15%. That particular crisis was kept at bay, and then overcome by a technically cleverpegging of the Hong Kong dollar to the United States dollar at a rate between 7.78 and HK$7.82 to US$1 on 17th October 1983. That"peg" has survived, unscathed, to this day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p202" class="pseudopara" id="p202">202.</a> Another potential crisis arose when Hang Lung Bank, unable to meet its commitments, was poised to crash on the 27th September 1983.The Hong Kong government averted a crisis in financial markets by stepping in immediately, and taking over the bank in a way thatensured the bank's customers and creditors got paid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p203" class="pseudopara" id="p203">203.</a> Another salient occurrence during the phase at which I am now looking was the suspension of Asean by the Commissioner of D.T.C.son 9th March 1984. Provisional liquidators and Special Managers were appointed for Asean on 13th November 1984. Northboume, too,went into compulsory liquidation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p204" class="pseudopara" id="p204">204.</a> O.T.B. was taken over by the Hong Kong government in March 1985 when a routine inspection of its books by officers from the BankingCommissioner discovered that it had concealed huge bad debts owing to it, thereby calling in question its solvency. As the resultof the fraudulent way in which O.T.B. had been run, its managing director, Mr Patrick Chang, who owned half the shares in Northbourne,went to prison.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">B. <u>ACTIVITIES OF ZANDA, ASEAN, BANK OF AMERICA AND BARCLAYS</u></p>    <p class="heading">(i) <u>Zanda</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p205" class="pseudopara" id="p205">205.</a> By the middle of November 1983 at the very latest, Mr S.Y.

There would have been no incentive for either of them to try to continue with their game of robbing Peter to payPaul, since their creditors would, by then, have had a good idea they were dealing with crooks, and would not have allowed them anyfurther scope for such games.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p301" class="pseudopara" id="p301">301.</a> Neither Mr S.Y. Ho nor Mr Eddie Leung at any stage reported the patently fraudulent behaviour of Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perezto the police or to I.C.A.C. Instead, Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung conducted themselves in such a way, on behalf of O.C.I.L., thatthey gave Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez ample time and opportunity to try to pay O.C.I.L. and Northbourne their share of themoney from the Zanda development.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p302" class="pseudopara" id="p302">302.</a> There is a letter dated the 13<sup>th</sup> December 1983 from Mr S.Y.

He knew full well that Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez had stolen the money, but he did notwant to accuse them openly of it. His motive in behaving in the way he did - giving Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez a long graceperiod to put the money back - , was, I think, based on the inference I draw from the evidence as a whole, a mixture of friendshipwith Mr Alexis Chan and unwillingness to offend powerful people like Mr Patrick Chang, his managing director, who was involved withMr Jesse Perez in Northbourne.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p306" class="pseudopara" id="p306">306.</a> Precisely who the people were whom Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung did not want to offend are impossible to identify from the evidenceavailable to me, and I cannot gauage how close his friendship was with Mr Alexis Chan, but I regard it as reasonable to infer thatsome such combination must have been at work, for, otherwise, his unwillingness to unmask Mr Alexis Cahn and Mr Jesse Perez wouldbe strange, indeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p307" class="pseudopara" id="p307">307.</a> In relation to Mr SY Hoâs letter of 13<sup>th</sup> December 1983 to Ms Stephenie Chan, she was asked under cross-examination which was âthe account of Zandaâ to which he was referringin the second sentence of the first paragraph. She replied she thoughthe was referring to Zandaâs current account with O.T.B.

Neither did Bank of America nor Barclays payZanda anything, since both banks denied the validity of its claim. I have previously mentioned how Zanda recovered $12 million fromABN in respect of cheques or cashier-orders for a total of$12.7 million payable to Zanda in August and September 1983, but collectedfor the personal account ofMr Alexis Chan at that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p314" class="pseudopara" id="p314">314.</a> Apart from O.C.I.L. and Northbourne, all of Zanda's creditors have been paid.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii) <u>ASEAN</u></p>    <p><a name="p315" class="pseudopara" id="p315">315.</a> Things went from bad to worse for Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p316" class="pseudopara" id="p316">316.</a> Government's' takeover of Hang Lung Bank on 27th September 1983 was like a death-knell for Asean which owed that bank $59 million.Without the friendly Mr Johnny Cheng at the helm any more, Asean could expect swift action from the new management at Hang Lung Bankto call in that massive loan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p317" class="pseudopara" id="p317">317.</a> In the period up until the end of 1983, so we learnt from Ms Stephenie Chan, Asean's creditors clamoured for payment. Before theend of that year, Mr Jesse Perez, with good reason, felt that Hong Kong was no longer a safe place for him to be, and departed forTaiwan where he has been based ever since.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p318" class="pseudopara" id="p318">318.</a> Towards the end of 1983 and in early 1984, Mr Alexis Chan was called in by the Commissioner of D.T.C.s for questioning about theaffairs of Asean. Mr Alexis Chan, who, apparently, had been planning to emigrate from Hong Kong in .any event, departed these shoresbefore the end of February 1984, and has not been back since.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p319" class="pseudopara" id="p319">319.</a> From Ms Stephenie Chan's evidence, it appears that Asean ceased to conduct business from the beginning of 1984, but its registrationas a deposit taking company was not formally suspended until the 9th March 1984. Special Manager was appointed for Asean on 13thNovember 1984 by order of the Court following appointment of the Official Receiver as provisional liquidator on the same day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p320" class="pseudopara" id="p320">320.</a> By his report dated the 28th November 1984, the Special Manager disclosed that Asean, theoretically, had so-called "receivables"of approximately $147 million, but of that amount, a mere $7 million looked to be actually collectable. Included in the balance ofapproximately $140 million in bad debts was approximately $63 million owed by the one debtor, Mr Henry Hung. As a D.T.C. with issuedcapital never exceeding $15 million, Asean can be seen to have been well and truly in breach of the provisions in the Ordinance aboutnot more than one quarter of a D.T.C.'s issued capital being lent to the one debtor. Mr Henry Hung in due course went to prison for4 years after pleading guilty to innumerable charges of having conspired with Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez to defraud Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p321" class="pseudopara" id="p321">321.</a> From the Special Manager's report, it has clearly emerged that not only were Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez totally lacking inintegrity, but, also, they had been extremely slapdash in the way they had managed Asean's affairs. Before granting loans to customers,they did not bother to seek any background information concerning the borrower's financial history. In some instances, loans weregranted to borrowers a few days after commencing business. No security, or inadequate security was obtained from borrowers. Onceloans had been granted, little, if anything, was done to follow them up. Periodic accounts were not demanded from borrowers to seewhether they were still credit-worthy. There were occasions when Asean did go as far as getting a judgment against a debtor, butthen nothing was done to enforce it.</p>    <p class="heading">(iii) <u>BANK OF AMERICA</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p322" class="pseudopara" id="p322">322.</a> Up until the end of October 1983, and perhaps even beyond, Mr Alexis Chan kept repeating his promise to Bank of America that as soonas Zanda received a Letter of Compliance, the sale to Tai Ting Estates would be completed, and Bank of America would be paid fromthe part of the proceeds due to Asean as a shareholder in and lender to Zanda. Throughout, I am satisfied, Mr Alexis Chan successfullypulled the wool over the eyes of those in Bank of America whose task it was to see Asean repaid its borrowings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p323" class="pseudopara" id="p323">323.</a> Towards the end of September 1983, Mr Alexis Chan actually gave Mr Arthur Lee of Bank of America a copy of the Agreement dated 3rdSeptember 1981 between Zanda and Tai Ting Estates, from which Bank of America could have gleaned that there never was any provisionfor the payment of any specific sum of $5 million, the sum Bank of America received on 7th September 1983 by means of the chequein dispute made payable to Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p324" class="pseudopara" id="p324">324.</a> I have little doubt that, if Mr Arthur Lee, or anyone else in Bank of America, had pointed that out to Mr Alexis Chan, he would havecome up with some plausible explanation of how the $5 million cheque came into being. In any event, the new information which cameinto Bank of America's possession after 7th September 1983 which might, with hindsight, have led Bank of America to suspect thatMr Alexis Chan had not told them the truth concerning delays over completion, and raising doubts over the origins of the $5 millioncheque are, to my mind, irrelevant on the all-important question of the state of Bank of America's knowledge as at 7th September1983, the date at which it collected the proceeds of the cheque.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p325" class="pseudopara" id="p325">325.</a> Hang Lung Bank's failure and takeover by government on 27th September 1983 quickly prompted Mr Arthur Lee, and his superior, Mr PeterLo, to make a call on Mr Alexis Chan to weigh the implications for Asean of Mr Johnny Cheng no longer having the resources of HangLung Bank at his disposal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p326" class="pseudopara" id="p326">326.</a> As at the 27th September 1983, Asean owed Bank of America $14,918,500. By the 29th September 1983 the outstanding loan had been reducedto $11.3 million. The evidence is not clear on how that reduction came about, but I do not think anything turns on that.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p327" class="pseudopara" id="p327">327.</a> On 30th September 1983, the fourth and final promissory note for $5 million in Bank of America's favour fell due. Asean defaultedon that, but, with the prospect of money via the Zanda completion being dangled in front of Bank of America, Bank of America agreedto a re-scheduling of all its outstanding loans to Asean, amounting to about $11 million, on the basis that it would all be paidby the one "balloon" payment on the 30th October 1983. At or about the end of September-or early October 1983, there had also beena promise from Mr Alexis Chan that Asean would pay at least $3 million to Bank of America before 19th October 1983. Nothing cameof that. Around the 27th October 1983, Mr Alexis Chan again promised further payment of $2 to $3 million from a source other thanthe Zanda completion. Nothing materialized.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p328" class="pseudopara" id="p328">328.</a> Although no further payment was forthcoming from Asean in October 1983, I am satisfied, from a memorandum dated 31st October 1983,from Mr Franklin Lam, the Account Officer in Bank of America who took over from Mr Arthur Lee in early October 1983, that Bank ofAmerica was at the time of that memorandum still confident of recovering its loans to Asean. Mr Franklin Lam thought that Asean'sbusiness operations were still profitable, and he regarded the risk of default as low. He also recognized, however, that other shareholdersor creditors of Zanda, in addition to Asean, might have claims on the Zanda completion monies.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p329" class="pseudopara" id="p329">329.</a> By the end of the first week in November 1983, Bank of America must have been losing patience with Asean, since it instructed solicitorsto write a letter of demand to Asean in respect of the sum of $11,412,845 still owing. Bank of America's solicitors duly wrote toAsean, demanding that amount on the 11th November 1983. That letter must have had a salutary effect in that Asean paid Bank of America$5 million on 23rd November 1983. That money came from Mr Alexis Chan's family company, Kin Fung Hong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p330" class="pseudopara" id="p330">330.</a> Further money must have come in from Asean before the end of that month since on 30th November 1983 Asean's outstanding debt to Bankof America was by then down to $2.92 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p331" class="pseudopara" id="p331">331.</a> Bank of America started taking a tougher line to recover the debt when it caused its solicitors on 20th December 1983 to send a letterof demand for the outstanding $2.932987 not only to Asean but also to its guarantors, Mr Alexis Chan, Mr Johnny Cheng and Mr JessePerez.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p332" class="pseudopara" id="p332">332.</a> Further dribs and drabs of money trickled in from Asean so that the debt was down to $1.6 million by the 24th January 1984.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p333" class="pseudopara" id="p333">333.</a> Mr Alexis Chan gave Bank of America a cheque postdated to the 31st January 1984 to discharge the outstanding balance. That chequewas dishonoured. Bank of America's immediate response was to issue a writ against Asean, Mr Alexis Chan, Mr Johnny Cheng and Mr JessePerez in respect of the remaining debt.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p334" class="pseudopara" id="p334">334.</a> Bank of America stayed its hand in the litigation when Mr Johnny Cheng agreed to pay Bank of America $0.7 million before the 17thFebruary 1984, and the remaining balance of $1 million before 15th March 1984. The bank accepted his proposal, and he duly paid themoney, so that Bank of America recovered everything owing to it by Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p335" class="pseudopara" id="p335">335.</a> Under sub-heading (i) of this section, I have already mentioned how Mr S. Y. Ho, on behalf of Zanda, wrote to Bank of America on12th March 1984, enquiring on behalf of whom Bank of America had collected the cheque for $5 million dated 7th September 1983 infavour of Zanda. I accept what Mr Franklin Lam told the Court about how he contacted those working for Asean at the time he receivedthat letter, and was assured that there had been an internal dispute amongst the shareholders of Zanda concerning the $5 million,but it was something they would sort out amongst themselves. He also received Zanda's letter of 17th March 1984, telling him therewere discussions with other parties which meant Bank of America was no longer required to investigate its records. The letter of7th May from Zanda to Bank of America was also dealt with by Mr Franklin Lam, and once again he contacted the Bank's customer, Asean,whose staff told Mr Franklin Lam that the dispute over the $5 million cheque was an internal matter for the shareholders in Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p336" class="pseudopara" id="p336">336.</a> Despite Bank of America's prodigious debt-collecting skills, as evidenced by their making full recovery from Asean in difficult circumstances,I regard it as unlikely in the extreme that Bank of America would have been able to collect a further $5 million, even if they hadbeen told as early as the 8th September 1983 that they were not entitled to retain the $5 million they had collected the previousday on the cheque made payable to Zanda. I have already expressed my opinion that none of the creditor-banks would have been likelyto recover anything from Asean had the truth come out at an early stage that Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez had helped themselvesto the Asean funds which should have been held for Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p337" class="pseudopara" id="p337">337.</a> Bank of America were affected by the same illusions as everyone else concerning the integrity, wealth and efficiency of Mr AlexisChan, Mr Jesse Perez and Mr Johnny Cheng. I do not think I have to labour the point about the reality of the supposed integrity ofthat trio. No doubt, up until the end of 1982 and probably also for a considerable time after that, all three of them were wealthy,Mr Johnny Cheng being exceedingly so. However, from about the middle of 1983, much of their wealth looks to have been exhausted,and as the end of 1983 approached, they were obviously finding it difficult to raise even the odd million dollars or two. By early1984 all three of them were obviously in poor shape, financially. There was no hope of getting anything out of Mr Jesse Perez sincehe had taken himself out of the jurisdiction. Mr Alexis Chan suffered the humiliation of not being able to honour a cheque for $1.6million which was a comparatively small amount for one coming from a family which had been hugely rich. Mr Johnny Cheng, whose sharesin Hang Lung Bank alone were thought to be worth over $250 million at the end of 1982, needed, in effect, six weeks to pay Bank ofAmerica the final $1.6 million outstanding to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p338" class="pseudopara" id="p338">338.</a> On the view I take, even assuming that the type of estoppel claimed by Bank of America can exist as a matter of law (and I stronglydoubt that it does), I am satisfied, on the facts, that Bank of America suffered no prejudice as the result of any inaction by Zandaafter 7th September 1983, because there was no realistic prospect of Bank of America extracting a further $5 million, or any othersum of that order of magnitude, from Asean, Mr Johnny Cheng, Mr Alexis Chan or Mr Jesse Perez, either singly or collectively.</p>    <p class="heading">(iv) <u>BARCLAYS</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p339" class="pseudopara" id="p339">339.</a> Mr Stephen Leung, the Senior Manager of Barclays who gave evidence on Barclays' procedures, described how, in the run-up to the 7thSeptember 1983, Barclays must have felt comfortable with its client, Asean, for otherwise Barclays would not have allowed Asean toroll-over credits as they expired. He pointed out how, for example, on the 2nd September 1983, Barclays gave its approval to extendits loan of $3.5 million to Asean for three more months, from 6th September 1983, the date the lending facility would otherwise haveexpired.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p400" class="pseudopara" id="p400">400.</a> Despite its feelings of comfort at the beginning of September 1983, Barclays had good cause to feel extremely uncomfortable aboutAsean and its managing director, Mr Alexis Chan, before that month expired:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p401" class="pseudopara" id="p401">401.</a> On 27th September 1983 - the very day on which the Hong Kong government took over the Hang Lung Bank - Asean bluntly announced toBarclays that it could no longer repay its borrowings from any of the banks which had lent to it. As Mr Mills-Owen so rightly putit, matters must have become calamitous in Asean for any of those managing it to make a statement like that.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p402" class="pseudopara" id="p402">402.</a> On the 29th September 1983, the management of Bar clays got the opportunity to see Mr Alexis Chan, at last, in his true colours:that day he denied knowing anything about the promise he had given Mr Peart of Barclays on 11th August 1983 to reduce Asean's outstandingloans to Barclays by the mount of $2 million per month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p403" class="pseudopara" id="p403">403.</a> One can immediately detect a change in Barclays' attitude towards its customer from the 29th September, 1983, onwards. From internalcorrespondence of Barclays of 29th September 1983, one sees the management in Hong Kong informing the London Headoffice that Barclaysin Hong Kong was not only unwilling to consider increasing borrowing facilities to Asean, but was in fact looking for further deductionsin the amount outstanding, with the ultimate aim of having the Asean account fully secured or otherwise repaid in full.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p404" class="pseudopara" id="p404">404.</a> Barclays' new-found disenchantment with its customer can be discerned in the letter sent from the manager of the Causeway Bay Branchof Barclays to Asean, for the attention of Mr Alexis Chan, on 3rd October 1983. No longer is the tone of the correspondence deferential,but, instead, Barclays asked Mr Alexis Chan straight questions about Asean's affairs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p405" class="pseudopara" id="p405">405.</a> Barclays' attempt in the present proceedings to blame Zanda for not letting Barclays know earlier about Asean's fraudulent dealingswith the $1 million from the cheque in dispute has a hollow ring to it when one sees how ineffective Barclays' own efforts at recoverywere from the beginning of October 1983 onwards, by which time it had been unmistakably revealed to Barclays that not only was Aseaninsolvent, but, also, its managing director was a liar, and hence, not to be trusted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p406" class="pseudopara" id="p406">406.</a> The suggestion that Barclays might have been galvanised into action if only Zanda had informed them earlier about Asean's misdeedsin relation to the $1 million in dispute flies in the face of the evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p407" class="pseudopara" id="p407">407.</a> No formal letter of demand went out to Asean, seeking recovery of the monies owed to Barclays until 4th January 1984. That letterwas from the manager at the Causeway Bay Branch. On 1st February 1984, another formal letter of demand went out from Barclays, thistime, not only addressed to Asean, but also to Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Johnny Cheng who were jointly and severally liable under a guaranteefor US$3 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p408" class="pseudopara" id="p408">408.</a> Barclays did not get round to issuing a writ against Asean, and the guarantors, until 14th July 1984. That was for $26,636,183. Judgmentwas obtained on that on 28th August, 1984. That judgment remains unsatisfied. A letter from Barclays' solicitors dated 11th October1984 showed that besides the judgment in Barclays favour, 11 other banks were engaged in proceedings against Asean for a total of$124 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p409" class="pseudopara" id="p409">409.</a> Perhaps, theoretically, Barclays might have been able to recover a further $1 million before the flood of legal proceedings takenagainst Asean by its various creditor-banks in early 1984 - Bank of America had been successful and so had the Bank of Malaysia whichrecovered $1 million from Asean in January 1984 - but, in practice, I regard it as highly unlikely that Barclays would have succeededin recovering an additonal $1 million, since the evidence indicates that Barclays' tactics were insufficiently aggressive to makeAsean or its guarantors pay much heed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p410" class="pseudopara" id="p410">410.</a> In relation to Bank of America under sub-heading (iii) above, I have already set out the correspondence nom Zanda to Bank of Americain early 1984, and having already explained that mutatis mutandis Barclays received the same letters, need say nothing further onthat.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>CREDIBILITY</u></p>    <p class="heading">1.  <u>Oral Witnesses</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p411" class="pseudopara" id="p411">411.</a> Only three witnesses who gave oral testimony in the case had possible purposes of their own to serve. That trio comprised Mr S. Y.Ho, Mr Eddie Leung, and Ms Stephenie Chan. The remaining witnesses were staff from the Defendant banks, Mr Gary Wong then of theaccountancy firm, Ernst &amp; Whimey, who conducted the special audit on Zanda in early 1984, and Mr Etches, an accountant who wasthe liquidator and Special Manager of Asean. All of the bank and accountancy witnesses impressed me as honest and accurate, tellingthe truth to the best of their ability.</p>    <p class="heading">A. <u>Mr S.Y. Ho</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p412" class="pseudopara" id="p412">412.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho had the following possible purposes of his own to serve: -</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(i) To divert all possible suspicion nom himself that he might have been implicated in the wrongful disposal of money which shouldhave found its way to Zanda;</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(ii) To forestall any possible suggestion he might have been involved in evading provisions of the D.T.C. Ordinance by Asean's lendingmoney to Zanda, indirectly via Clyde, in excess of the maximum a D.T.C. was permitted to lend to anyone customer;</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(iii) To explain away his dilatoriness in requiring Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez to explain what had happened to the balanceof the completion monies paid to Asean.</p>    <p><a name="p413" class="pseudopara" id="p413">413.</a> I will now deal with each of those apparent purposes in turn.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p414" class="pseudopara" id="p414">414.</a> (i) Although I was wholly satisfied that Mr S.Y. Ho had absolutely nothing to do with any misappropriation of Zanda's money, I, nonetheless,formed the view that he probably tailored his evidence in a way he thought most likely to minimize the risk of his being wrongfullyaccused of acting in concert with Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez to steal Zanda's money.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p415" class="pseudopara" id="p415">415.</a> Endeavouring to put distance between himself and anything to do with Asean's activity, I think there were two ways in which he probablytried to mislead the Court. Firstly, I think he was less than frank over his knowledge of Zanda's account with Asean, and, secondly,I did not believe I what I came to regard as his self-serving evidence about O.C.I.L. invariably requiring two signatures in relationto all operations of any sort of account involving one of its subsidiaries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p416" class="pseudopara" id="p416">416.</a> If Mr S.Y. Ho knew nothing about the Zanda account with Asean, he could not be faulted for any money of Zanda's disappearing fromthat account. Zanda, so I am satisfied, had had an account with Asean since 1980. There was nothing secret about the loan accountZanda had with Asean. Zanda's auditors, Ernst Whinney, knew about it all along (See Trial Bundle A, pages 158 and 172). Mr S.Y. Ho'sanswers under cross-examination that he never asked Mr Alexis Chan what was being done with Zanda's money, and his constant refrainof having left everything concerning the financing of Zanda to Mr Johnny Cheng stretched credulity too far. His claimed lack of curiosityconcerning Zanda's finances, and his "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" - performance in the witness box did not ring true.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p417" class="pseudopara" id="p417">417.</a> If, as Mr S.Y. Ho claimed, O.C.I.L. had this iron rule to the effect that any account for one of its subsidiaries could only be operatedwith two signatures, one of which had to be from the O.C.I.L. side, it followed, of course, that Mr S.Y. Ho had to be exoneratedfor the payment-in on the 7th September 1983 of the two disputed cheques endorsed by         Ms Stephenie' Chan alone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p418" class="pseudopara" id="p418">418.</a> In support of his contention that the O.C.I.L. rule of two signatures applied to Zanda in the same way as to any other O.C.I.L. subsidiary,he identified documents in Bundle A at pp.256 and 394/7 which purported to show that steps had been taken in pursuit of the objectiveof furnishing O.T.B. with a mandate only to accept cheques requiring indorsement paid into the Zanda account if the endorsement wasmade by one signature from the so-called "A" group and the other from the so-called "B" group. Those documents in Bundle A at pp.256and 397/7 were put forward on behalf of Zanda as vindication of Mr Ho's evidence on how any dealing with a Zanda cheque requiredtwo signatures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p419" class="pseudopara" id="p419">419.</a> Far from vindicating Mr S.Y. Ho, that evidence, in my view, seriously undermined his credibility. Those documents from Trial BundleA at pages 256 and 394/7 apparently supporting Mr S.Y. Ho's evidence that any dealing with a Zanda cheque, including indorsement,required two signatures were simply too good to be true. To my mind, it is virtually unthinkable that any bank would choose to burdenitself with a requirement that it was only empowered to treat cheques as properly endorsed if they carry two signatures. A bankerwould, in effect, be shooting himself in the foot if he did that, since he would then be throwing away the protection banks managedto gain for themselves when section 60, and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 82</a> to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19">Cap .19</a>, were passed, affording banks a measure of relief from liability in relation to endorsements on cheques.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p420" class="pseudopara" id="p420">420.</a> Besides the exceedingly strange coincidence that D.T.B. Bank, for reasons impossible to fathom, should have wanted to burden itselfwith this unusual mandate for endorsed cheques in relation to its current account with Zanda, there are other oddities about thedocuments from Trial Bundle A at pages A256 and 394/7 which call in question their authenticity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p421" class="pseudopara" id="p421">421.</a> A circular resolution under Zanda's articles requires the signature of all directors to be effective. However, the purported resolutionwhich found its way into O.T.B. archives happens to bear the signature of Mr S.Y. Ho alone. Were this a genuine document made contemporaneouslywith the date it bears, there should have been no difficulty in securing Mr Jesse Perez's signature on it then. If, however, thedocument was brought into existence after Mr Jesse Perez disappeared from Hong Kong, the absence of his signatures becomes no causefor surprise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p422" class="pseudopara" id="p422">422.</a> Under Zanda's Article 46, it was permissible for a circular resolution to become effective by each director signing a separate document.If that course had been adopted in the present instance, there would then be the strange circumstance that the part supposedly signedby Mr Jesse Perez was not returned to O.T.B., and kept with the part signed by Mr S.Y. Ho.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p423" class="pseudopara" id="p423">423.</a> Another strange feature of the purported O.T.B. indorsement mandate documents for Zanda is that there are two versions, which, byitself shows this was no standard-form O.T.B. documentation, but something being specially crafted for the occasion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p424" class="pseudopara" id="p424">424.</a> The combination of Mr S.Y. Ho's intrinsically unlikely evidence about O.C.I.L. having given special thought to indorsements on cheques,resulting in its always requiring two, and the strange documents in Trial Bundle A at pages 256 and 394/7 centring on the indorsementposition between OT.B. and Zanda made me doubt Mr S.Y. Ho's evidence on the topic of indorsement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p425" class="pseudopara" id="p425">425.</a> In fact, the simple truth was all that was needed to exonorate Mr S.Y. Ho from any suggestion of peculation, but, to be on the safeside, he appears to have thought he had better try to improve upon it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p426" class="pseudopara" id="p426">426.</a> I think that more likely than not the documents A 256 and 394/7 were devised by Mr S.Y. Ho, and planted either by him, or at hisdirection, in the O.T.B. archives to lay the ground-work in case he were ever called upon to explain how Zanda's money could havedisappeared while he was a director of that company. Mr S.Y. Ho had plenty of time to do that in the interval between his learningthat Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez had tricked him, and Mr S.Y. Ho being ousted from O.C.I.L. when O.T.B. was taken over by thegovernment in 1985.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p427" class="pseudopara" id="p427">427.</a> The fact that the document from bundle A p.394/7 bean; the chop number 30098556, which is the same as that on other Zanda documentsin the O.T.B. archive, does nothing to increase the likelihood that the document is genuine, rather than concocted. A simple adjustmentto a chop can produce any number at any time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p428" class="pseudopara" id="p428">428.</a> The witness who produced these documents from the O.T.B. archive was, obviously, in no way involved in tampering with any documentsthere. She did not commence working for O.T.B. until 1988, and would have known nothing of the history of the document from BundleA at p.394/7. She simply produced to the court the documents that had been in the archive.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p429" class="pseudopara" id="p429">429.</a> (ii) If Mr S. Y. Ho were to be believed, he knew next to nothing about Asean, and even less about Clyde. His anxiety to' distancehimself from Clyde is understandable. Clearly, that company was used by those running Asean to avoid the provisions of the D.T.C.Ordinance designed to prevent a D.T.C. lending more than 25% of its paid up capital and reserves to anyone borrower. While I findit difficult to accept that Mr S.Y. Ho never knew about Clyde until receiving Ernst and Whinney management accounts in February orMarch 1984, I, nonetheless, do not think he was in any way responsible for any of the stratagems devised by Mr Alexis Chan and MrJesse Perez to evade the D.T.C. Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p430" class="pseudopara" id="p430">430.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho's claim to total ignorance on how Zanda was to pay the building contractors, and his insistence on how he left everythingconcerned with financing to Mr Johnny Cheng struck me as somewhat unlikely, bearing in mind that Mr S.Y. Ho was one of only two substantivedirectors of Zanda. He could have saved himself the trouble of distorting the truth about his state of knowledge concerning the sourcesof Zanda's funding, because the way Asean and Clyde were run was outside of his control, but he gave his evidence in the way he didto forestall any possibility of his being linked to either Asean or Clyde, companies which were operated in reckless disregard ofthe law.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p431" class="pseudopara" id="p431">431.</a> (iii) I found it difficult to believe Mr S. Y. Ho's contention that he did not know about Asean receiving the balance 'of the completionmoney from the Zanda/Tai Ting Estates transaction until mid-November 1983. I regard it as more likely that he knew about that sometime in or about the second half of September 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p432" class="pseudopara" id="p432">432.</a> He knew that the building was physically completed by the end of June 1983, and I regard it as unlikely that he would have kept onbelieving Mr Alexis Chan until mid-November on the point about the Occupation Permit not having been granted by the government untilthen.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p433" class="pseudopara" id="p433">433.</a> Mr S.Y. Ho was not limited to Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez for information concerning the Occupation Permit, and the receiptof the balance of the completion money. There was nothing to prevent Mr S.Y. Ho asking either the architect, Mr Edmond Wong, or thesolicitor, Mr Chau about the status of the new building. Bearing in mind that Mr S. Y. Ho was the secretary of O.C.I.L. and I.C.I.L.,through which O.T.B. was owned, Mr S.Y. Ho's evidence on how Messrs Tsang, Chau &amp; Shuen, solicitors with a practise which includedconveyancing, did not return his phone call, is simply unbelievable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p434" class="pseudopara" id="p434">434.</a> The letters which Mr S.Y. Ho sent to Mr Alexis Chan from and including the one of 31st October 1983 (Trial Bundle "A" page 303) donot necessarily preclude his already knowing by then that Mr Alexis Chan had misappropriated Zanda's money. From a not wholly dishonourablesense of loyalty, Mr S.Y. Ho, looks, from the evidence, to have tried to give Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez time to put the moneyback. Even from the time that Mr S.Y. Ho himself admits that he became aware of Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez having taken Zanda'smoney, Mr S.Y. Ho can be seen to have refrained taking any really drastic action against either of that pair. The impression I gotfrom the evidence was that, to avoid trouble for himself as much as anything, Mr S.Y. Ho applied some pressure on Mr Alexis Chanand Mr Jesse Perez to get them to put the money back, but always stopped short of any measure which might have resulted in policeaction against them. Mr S.Y. Ho's letters of the 31st October 1983 (Trial Bundle "A" page 303), and 13th December 1983 (Trial Bundle"A" page 305) went as far as Mr S.Y. Ho was prepared to go in putting pressure Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez under pressure withoutcrossing the threshhold of openly accusing them of the theft of Zanda's money.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p435" class="pseudopara" id="p435">435.</a> At no stage does one see Mr S.Y. Ho going all out against Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez: he always held back when it came tothe point of grasping the nettle of accusing them of what must have become unmistakably clear to him from at the very latest, mid-November1983, namely, that they were thieves.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p436" class="pseudopara" id="p436">436.</a> In a misguided effort aimed at deflecting suspicion from himself, I think Mr S.Y. Ho came up with a version of the facts which, incidentally,might assist Zanda in the present claim against Asean. In particular, I disbelieve his evidence about cheques payable to Zanda alwaysrequiring two signatures for a valid indorsement, and, despite his prevarication, I was, ultimately, left in no doubt that his intentionas a director of Zanda had consistently been that the completion monies from the sale to Tai Ting Estates were all to be depositedwith Asean for the purposes of paying creditors and distributing profits to the shareholders. In the end, under cross-examination,he himself had to admit that the intention of Zandaâs directors was to deposit the completion monies with Asean. I have the followingpassages from the courtâs record in mind:-</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p437" class="pseudopara" id="p437">437.</a> â(Mr Barlowâs cross-examination)</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">P.248   Q.

Ho. Most of his evidence consisted of denials of knowinganything. I think he knew more than he cared to let on, but failed to tell the whole truth for the same reasons as those I have identifiedas leading Mr S.Y. Ho to tell less than the truth.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Ms Stephenie Chan</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p439" class="pseudopara" id="p439">439.</a> The possible purpose of her own she had to serve was avoiding the prospect of finding herself liable in third party proceedings broughtby Bank of America and Barclays if Zanda's present action against them on the disputed cheques were to succeed. Despite the temptationto give her evidence in a way which would support the defence of the Defendant-banks that her signature alone on cheques made payableto Zanda was sufficient to constitute a valid indorsement, I was satisfied she resisted it, and told the truth to the best of herrecollection.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>2. The Witness Beyond the Seas</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p440" class="pseudopara" id="p440">440.</a> The witness falling into this category was Mr Jesse Perez whose sworn statements made specially for use in the present trial wereworthless, bearing in mind the character of the maker, except insofar as the content was either inherently probable, or corroboratedby independent credible evidence. On that basis, I rule those statements as admissible and they become Exhibits - BA20 and BB4.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>LAW</u></p>    <p class="heading"><u>1. Delegation of Authority by Zanda</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p441" class="pseudopara" id="p441">441.</a> A company as an artificial legal entity must of necessity act through the medium of its human officers or agents. But not every actof theirs will bind the company. Whether the company is bound will depend, first, on whethe the act is within the capacity of thecompany, and secondly on whether they have acted within the scope of their employment or authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p442" class="pseudopara" id="p442">442.</a> Can Ms Stephenie Chan be treated as having been authorised by Zanda to indorse the two cheques, the subject of the present proceedings?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p443" class="pseudopara" id="p443">443.</a> It will be recalled that by a Zanda board resolution dated 30th April 1983, Ms Stephenie Chan, with effect from 1<sup>st</sup> May 1983 became an alternate director of Zanda in substitution for Ms Carmencita Cheng and had also replaced Ms Cheng as an authorisedsignatory for Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p444" class="pseudopara" id="p444">444.</a> The first and last documents Ms Stephenie Chan purported to sign on behalf of Zanda were the three cheques she indorsed on 7th September1983 under the direction of Mr Alexis Chan in the absence of Mr Jesse Perez. Shortly afterwards - probably later the same day orthe next day - Mr Jesse Perez gave her to understand he approved what she had done.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p445" class="pseudopara" id="p445">445.</a> The impression I got from the evidence as a whole was that Ms Stephenie Chan, who was young and inexperienced in the ways of businessat the time, had no idea then of the duties and powers of a director, whether alternate or otherwise, and simply did whatever MrAlexis Chan or Mr Jesse Perez told her to do, without exercising any independent judgment of her own.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p446" class="pseudopara" id="p446">446.</a> There is nothing specific in Zanda's articles on the topic of who in the company was empowered to sign cheques.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p447" class="pseudopara" id="p447">447.</a> Under the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> in force at that time a single signatory could, as a matter of law, be endowed by a company with capacity to endorse cheques. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>, in force on 7th September 1983, provided as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"33. A bill of exchange or promissory note shall be deemed to have been made, accepted, or endorsed on behalf of a company if made,accepted, or endorsed in the name of, or by or on behalf or on account of, the company by any person acting under its authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p448" class="pseudopara" id="p448">448.</a> That has since been changed so that, to make a valid endorsement nowadays, at least two persons have to be authorised by the companyto sign on its behalf, a change which, however, makes no difference to the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p449" class="pseudopara" id="p449">449.</a> Despite there being no objection in principle at the material time to one person enjoying capacity by his or her sole signature validlyto indorse a cheque on behalf of a company, it was, of course, still crucial to look at the company's articles and to consider theposition of the purported signatory within the company in order to arrive at a decision in a particular case whether a particularindividual should be treated as authorised by the company to endorse.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p450" class="pseudopara" id="p450">450.</a> The extent of Ms Stephenie Chan's power to endorse on behalf of Zanda can conveniently be considered from the point of view of thetwo capacities in which she served, namely, first, as an alternate director, and, secondly, as a personal secretary to Mr AlexisChan and Mr Jesse Perez.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p451" class="pseudopara" id="p451">451.</a> To find out Ms Stephenie Chan's powers as an alternate director, recourse has to be made to Zanda's' articles including (insofaras not inconsistent) those brought in pursuant to Article 2 from Table A in the First Schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> then in force.</p>    <p><a name="p452" class="pseudopara" id="p452">452.</a> The following articles govern the position:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"1. In these Articles, unless there is something in the subject or context inconsisted therewith :- â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">'Manager' means the Managing Director and any other Manager or Managers for the time being of the company â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">'Working Director' means the Managing Director and any other Director holding an office or place of profit as provided in Article38(d) hereof â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">38(d). A Director may hold any other office or place of profit other than that of Auditor under the Company in conjunction with hisdirectorship. Any such director and any manager may be appointed to office upon such terms as to remuneration, tenure of office orotherwise as may be arranged by the Directors. Such remuneration may either be in addition to or in substitution for his share inthe remuneration hereinbefore provided for the other Directors.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">48. A Director may at any time appoint any other person (whether a Director or Member of the Company or not) to act as Alternate Directorat any Meeting of the Board at which the Director is not present, and may at any time revoke any such appointment. An Alternate Directorso appointed shall not be entitled as such to receive any remuneration from the Company, but shall otherwise be subject to the provisionsof Table A and of these presents with regard to Directors. An Alternate Director shall be entitled to receive notices of all Meetingsof the Board and to attend and vote as a Director at any such Meeting at which the Director appointing him is not personally present,and generally to perform all the functions, rights, powers and duties of the Director by whom he was appointed in his capacity asa Director but not in his capacity as a manager or working Director"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The following are from Table A</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"67. The business of the company shall be managed by the directors, who may pay all expenses incurred in getting up and registeringthe company, and may exercise all such powers of the company, as are not, by the Ordinance, or by these articles, required to beexercised by the company in general meeting, subject, nevertheless, to any regulation of these articles, to the provisions of theOrdinance, and to such regulations, being not inconsistent with the aforesaid regulations or provsions, as may be, prescribed bythe company in general meeting; but no regulation made by the company in general meeting shall invalidate any prior act of the directorswhich would have been valid if that regulation had not been made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">68.

The directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they thinkfit; any committee so formed shall in the exercise of the powers so delegated conform to any regulations that may be imposed on itby the directors."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p453" class="pseudopara" id="p453">453.</a> It can be seen that the scheme of Zanda's articles is for its business to be managed by its directors, that is to say, the boardas a whole (Article 67). The directors can delegate their powers to committees consisting of such directors as they think fit. AsZanda had only two directors at all material times - Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez - it meant that, in practice, Mr S.Y. Ho coulddelegate his powers to Mr Jesse Perez and vice-versa (Article 85). One of the directors could be appointed by the other or othersas managing director or manager but such appointment would automatically terminate if he ceased to be a director (Article 68). Theeffect of that was Zanda's manager had to be a serving director.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p454" class="pseudopara" id="p454">454.</a> Turning now to alternate directors, it is clear from Article 48 and the definitions of "Manager" and "Working Director" that, atboard meetings, they had the same powers as the substantive director to whom they were alternate, but had none of his powers outsideboard meetings to perform managerial functions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p455" class="pseudopara" id="p455">455.</a> Almost certainly, I would have thought, the endorsing of cheques in Zanda has to be regarded as a managerial function. Hence, MsStephenie Chan's position as alternate director could not endow her with the capacity to endorse away cheques on Zanda's behalf.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p456" class="pseudopara" id="p456">456.</a> Under the doctrine of constructive notice, any outsiders dealing with Zanda are deemed to know the limitations imposed on Zanda'sofficers by the articles. Thus, neither Bank of America, nor Barclays can treat Ms Stephenie Chan's purported indorsement in hercapacity of alternate Director as authorised by Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p457" class="pseudopara" id="p457">457.</a> How about in her position as personal secretary to Mr Alexis Chan and/or Mr Jesse Perez?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p458" class="pseudopara" id="p458">458.</a> Based on a whole raft of cases, Diplock L.J., in <i>Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 480</a>, 506 propounded a test for determining whether a party, who deals with an agent purporting to act on behalf of a company but lackingactual authority, can, nonetheless, treat the company as bound in contract on the basis of ostensible authority. The test embodiesfour conditions, failure to meet any one of which on the part of a claimant seeing to enforce the contract will result in the companynot being bound. Those four conditions require the claimant ("contractor" in Lord Diplock's word) to show:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) that a representation that the agent had authority to enter on behalf of the company into a contract of the kind sought to beenforced was made to the contractor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) that such representation was made by a person or persons who had "actual" authority to manage the business of the company eithergenerally or in respect of those matters to which the contract relates;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) that he (the contractor).was induced by such representation to enter into the contract, that is, that he in fact relied upon it;and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) that under its memorandum or articles of association the company was not deprived of the capacity either to enter into a contractof the kind sought to be enforced or to delegate authority to enter into a contract of that kind to the agent.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p459" class="pseudopara" id="p459">459.</a> For convenience, I will consider Condition 4 first. Bearing in mind the specific articles to which I have already made reference,one quickly sees that not only does Condition 4 disqualify any claim Zanda might have delegated power to Miss Stephenie Chan to endorsecheques qua personal secretary, but it could, also, have been used to defeat the suggestion I have already dealt with that she mighthave enjoyed power to endorse qua alternate director. Condition 4 merely embodies the constructive notice doctrine. The same Zandaarticles which demolish the claim that Ms Stephenie Chan, as alternate director, might have been authorised to endorse cheques onbehalf of the company apply with equal force to dispel any notion that as a personal secretary such authority might have been delegatedto her.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p460" class="pseudopara" id="p460">460.</a> At the risk of over-kill, I will briefly say why I think the claim that she, as a personal secretary, should be treated as clothedwith authority from Zanda to endorse away cheques fails to satisfy any of Diplock L.J.'s other three conditions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p461" class="pseudopara" id="p461">461.</a> Condition (1) embodies the agency principle found in a long line of cases to the effect that if a company holds out one of its staffas a particular kind of employee - In our case, Ms Stephenie Chan was held out as a personal secretary - the company will be liablefor her acts if they result from her exercising a power that sort of employee would usually have, regardless of whether the companyhas conferred such actual authority on her or not. Cases illustrating that concept are <i>Royal British Bank v Turquand</i> (1856) 6 E. &amp; B.327; <i>Mahony v East Holyford Mining Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%20LR%207%20HL%20869" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875), L.R. 7 H.L. 869</a>; <i>Biggerstaff v.

A case subsequent to <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</i>, illustrating its principles is <i>Hely-Hutchison v Brayhead Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20QB%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 Q.B. 549.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p462" class="pseudopara" id="p462">462.</a> In my view it would be far from usual for a company in Zanda's line of business, namely, property development, to permit a personalsecretary, whether alone, or even with any other officer of the company, to indorse away cheques.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p463" class="pseudopara" id="p463">463.</a> Insofar as Condition (2) is concerned, the simple fact is that those who had actual authority to manage Zanda's business, namely,Mr SY Ho and Mr Jesse Perez, neither jointly nor separately represented that Ms Stephenie Chan as a private secretary had authorityto indorse cheques ; nor was it within their power to delegate such authority to her.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p464" class="pseudopara" id="p464">464.</a> Mr Alexis Chan had no actual authority to manage Zanda's business, since he was not a director.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p465" class="pseudopara" id="p465">465.</a> For the purposes of Condition 3, there is not even a scintilla of evidence to suggest that any representation was made to eitherBank of America nor Barclays suggesting that Ms Stephenie Chan might be authorised to indorse away cheques, so the question of theirbeing induced by such a representation simply does not arise. Insofar as Bank of America is concerned, there was positive evidencefrom Mr Arthur Lee that his bank did not rely on Miss Stephenie Chan's purported indorsement on behalf of Zanda. What he relied on,for Bank of America, was the indorsement of Mr Titus Lee, the Assistant General Manager of Asean on behalf of Asean, Mr Arthur Lee'scustomer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p466" class="pseudopara" id="p466">466.</a> In the context of authorisation, it was argued on behalf of Zanda that Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Eddie Leung would never have authorisedpaying the balance of the completion monies to Asean, since, from 1st July 1983 onwards, it had become illegal for a registered D.T.C.to accept money on deposit for a period of less than three months; and, since O.C.I.L. would have wanted access to its share of theprofits straight away, therefore neither Mr S.Y. Ho nor Mr Eddie Leung for O.C.I.L. would have pennitted Asean to hold money forZanda on deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p467" class="pseudopara" id="p467">467.</a> In fact, there was no evidence that the prohibition against registered D.T.C.s accepting deposits for a shorter duration than threemonths played any part in the thinking of either Mr S.Y. Ho or Mr Eddie Leung. Neither of them made any reference to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p468" class="pseudopara" id="p468">468.</a> I am far from persuaded that the evidence shows O.C.I.L. expected its share of the profits immediately. I regard it as equally likelythat O.C.I.L. would have been content to wait for its share of the profits until Asean had paid off all Zanda's creditors. Meanwhile,whatever money was to go to O.C.I.L. by way of its share of profit would have been earning interest from Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p469" class="pseudopara" id="p469">469.</a> Strictly speaking, Zanda could only make a distribution of profits to shareholders if a resolution to that effect was passed by thecompany in general meeting, and previously, Zanda had held general meetings in December each year. If Zanda followed the same patternas previous years, by the time the annual general meeting came round in December 1983, three months would have elapsed, assumingZanda received the balance of the completion monies in August, September 1983. Of course, Zanda could have held its general meetingearlier if that was what the shareholders wanted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p470" class="pseudopara" id="p470">470.</a> Moreover, there would have been nothing illegal about paying Zanda's money into Asean in September 1983. Illegality would only ariseif the deposit were uplifted before three months elapsed, and Mr Ho and Mr Eddie Leung could have avoided being implicated in thatin the same way they had avoided involving themselves in Asean's other breaches of the D.T.C. Ordinance when it lent Zanda more than25% of Asean's capital and reserves via Clyde Investment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p471" class="pseudopara" id="p471">471.</a> Since neither Mr S.Y. Ho nor Mr Eddie Leung was a signatory of Zanda's account with Asean, each of them was in the happy positionof being able to blame others if Asean in any way inftinged the D.T.C. Ordinance in relation to the way in which it dealt with moneyit was holding for Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p472" class="pseudopara" id="p472">472.</a> Prominent in the opening address on behalf of Zanda was the argument that as Zanda could only draw on its accounts with O.T.B. andDaiwa Overseas Finance if there were joint signatures from the "A" (O.C.I.L.) and "B" (Asean) groups, the court should infer thatindorsement away of cheques payable to Zanda should only be treated as authorised by Zanda if there were, likewise, a joint indorsementof such cheques from the "A" and "B" groups. That argument is clearly fallacious since Zanda's authorisation to O.T.B. and DaiwaOverseas Finance to recognize only joint signatures for drawings stemmed from the specific written mandates Zanda gave O.T.B. andDaiwa Overseas Finance in relation to the drawing of cheques. Those mandates did not even cover the position where O.T.B. or DaiwaOverseas Finance collected third party cheques for Zanda, let alone the postiion where strangers to those mandates such as Bank ofAmerica and Barclays were concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p473" class="pseudopara" id="p473">473.</a> By the time of the closing arguments those appearing for Zanda while not abandoning the point about the analogy between the numberof signatures Zanda required for drawing cheques and indorsing them placed little emphasis on the point and instead concentratedon the far more effective argument concerning the lack of authorisation for an alternate director to indorse in the light of Zanda'sArticles, a point I do not recall being even touched upon in Zanda's opening.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p474" class="pseudopara" id="p474">474.</a> On the view I take, the argument on Zanda's behalf by way of analogy with the bank mandates was thoroughly bad, whilst its argumentbased on Zanda's argument was good insofar as it went, but did not carry the day because of the way s.86 of the Bills of ExchangeOridnance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19">Cap. 19</a> and other defences operated in relation to the facts of the present case. Section 86 is my next topic.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>2. Section 86 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a></u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p475" class="pseudopara" id="p475">475.</a> If I am correct in regarding Ms Stephenie Chan as unauthorised to indporse away cheques made payable to Zanda because of the limitingprovisions of Zanda's Articles, the consequence would normally follow that her purported indorsements on behalf of Zanda would beineffective for the purpose of entitling the Defendant-banks to retain the proceeds of the cheques in dispute against the claimsof the true owner, Zanda. That result would flow from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 24</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19">Cap. 19</a>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"24.

In view of thatconcession, there is no scope for Zanda to rely on the part of its Reply alleging the Defendant-banks had actual or constructiveknowledge of defects in title to the disputed cheques. Moreover, I am satisfied, on the facts, that there was nothing by way of knowingassistance or turning a blind eye on the part of either Defendant-bank to the dishonest way in which Mr Alexis Chan andMr Jesse Perezran Asean : see <i>Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All E.R. 393:</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p482" class="pseudopara" id="p482">482.</a> If either Defendant-bank could bring itself within subsection (3) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 86</a>, by showing that its only negligence was failure to concern itself with "absence of, or irregularity in, indorsement", it would havea cut-and- dried defence. On the view I take, however, the operation of sub-section (3) is confined to the situation where the absentor irregular indorsement is that of the collecting banker's customer (in the present case, Asean), and not some earlier indorsement,(Zanda's), along the chain. I think the following passage from Goode's Commercial Law, page 504 correctly summarises the position:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"Since it is no longer necessary to indorse a cheque purely for collection, the collecting banker has no duty to call for his customer'sindorsement, nor to examine such an indorsement if made, given that the customer is the ostensible payee or indorsee. On the otherhand, the banker is still obliged to ensure that the cheque carries all indorsements necessary to establish its customer's titleto the cheque. Accordingly, if the customer is not the original payee the banker must examine the back of the cheque for the indorsementsof the payee arid of any intervening special indorsee."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p483" class="pseudopara" id="p483">483.</a> At first blush, it might appear that Ms Stephenie Chan's signature fell within the ambit of "irregularity", since, in layman's parlance,an unauthorised signature could be described as irregular. However, in this branch of the law, âirregularityâ is a term art,confined to such minor matters as discrepancies in the name of the payee of a cheque and the indorser, e.g., the payee being shownas "John A Smith", but the indorsee signing "John B. Smith": see Cowen on The Law of Negotiable Instruments in South Africa (whichalso deals with the situation in England from which Hong Kong borrowed its bills of exchange legislation), page 120.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p484" class="pseudopara" id="p484">484.</a> The language of sub-section (3) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a> was never intended, in my view, to deal with cheques suffering from the fundamental defect of an indorsement, other than that ofthe banker's customer, being either forged or unauthorised. Where such an earlier indorsement is forged or unauthorised, the collectingbanker, instead of enjoying the special exoneration afforded by sub-section (3), is thrown back on the general defence afforded himby sub-section (1) if he can show he acted without negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p485" class="pseudopara" id="p485">485.</a> It cannot be doubted that where, as in the present case, cheques are crossed "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only", and the collectingbank is not collecting for the original payee but an indorsee, the collecting bank owes a duty of care to the true owner to takesuch steps as may be reasonable to satisfy himself that the payee has authorized receipt of the money for the bank's customer. Thestandard of care required of a banker is the ordinary prudence expected of those carrying on a banking business in accordance withnormal and proper banking practice : see <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1929%5d%201%20KB%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1929] 1 K.B. 40.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p486" class="pseudopara" id="p486">486.</a> The approach the court should adopt for the purpose of determining whether a banker has been negligent is explained by Diplock, L.J.(as he then was) in <i>Marfani &amp; Co.

The following passages from his judgment showthe duty of care required of a banker:-</p>    <p>Page 972A-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA purist might also comment (and some have) on the use of the expression 'negligence,' a term of art appropriate to a cause ofaction different in its legal characteristics from that of conversion or money had and received in respect of which the qualifiedimmunity is conferred. It is, however, in my view, clear that the intention of the subsection and its statutory predecessors is tosubstitute for the absolute duty owed at common law by a banker to the true owner of a cheque not to take any steps in the ordinarycourse of business leading up to and including the receipt of payment of the cheque, and the crediting of the amount of the chequeto the account of his customer, in usurpation of the true owner's title thereto a qualified duty to take resonable care to refrainfrom taking any such step which he foresees is, or ought reasonably to have foreseen was, likely to cause loss or damage to the trueowner.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The only respect in which this substituted statutory duty differs from a common law cause of action in negligence is that, since ittakes the form of a qualified immunity from a strict liability at common law, the onus of showing that he did take such reasonablecare lies upon the defendant banker. Granted good faith in the banker (the other condition of the immunity), the usual matter withrespect to which the banker must take reasonable care is to satisfy himself that his own customer's title to the cheque deliveredto him for collection is not defective, i.e., that no other person is the true owner of it. Where the customer is in possession ofthe cheque at the time of delivery for collection and appears upon the face of it to be the 'holder,' i.e., the payee or indorseeor the bearer, the banker is, in my view: entitled to assume that the customer is the owner of the cheque unless there are factswhich are, or ought to be, known to him which would cause a reasonable banker to suspect that the customer was not the true owner.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Page 973B â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhat the court has to do is to look at all the circumstances at the time of the acts complained of and to ask itself: were thosecircumstances such as would cause a reasonable banker possessed of such information about his customer as a reasonable banker wouldpossess, to suspect that his customer was not the true owner of the cheque?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Page 975H â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"It is to be borne in mind that, whatever inquiries it might be prudent for the bank to make for their own purposes, the only inquirieswhich they were under any duty to the plaintiff to make were inquiries directed to discovering whether their new (or, in the presentcase "old", my parenthesis) customer might use the account for the fraudulent purpose of cashing cheques belonging to other people."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p487" class="pseudopara" id="p487">487.</a> Various authorities emphasize how the courts should adopt a practical, commercial view in detennining whether a banker has actedreasonably. Diplock L.J. in <i>Marfani</i> at page 973H emphasizes that the Bills of Exchange legislation "was intended to apply to business transactions as they are carriedout in real life". Observations to similar effect are to be found in <i>Australia and</i> <i>New Zealand Bank Limited v Ateliers De Construction Electriques De Charleroi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20AC%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] AC, 86</a>, 113, and <i>Souhrada v Bank of New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20444" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 444.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p488" class="pseudopara" id="p488">488.</a> A suggestion from those appearing for Zanda that'Mr Arthur Lee should have insisted on a copy resolution from Zanda authorizing MsStephenie Chan to indorse away cheques payable to Zanda on her sole signature were, I feel, ignoring commercial reality.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p489" class="pseudopara" id="p489">489.</a> Although the Marfani case was concerned with the liability of a collecting banker to the drawer of a crossed cheque without any specialmarkings in a situation where a dishonest employee had opened a new bank account for the purpose of paying in the cheque made payableto a customer of his employer, the duty of the collecting banker there to take reasonable care in the light of all the surrounditigcircumstances is no different, in principle, from that applicable to the present case before me where the Defendant collecting bankscollected cheques crossed "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only" for other than the true owner.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p490" class="pseudopara" id="p490">490.</a> Crossed cheques marked ''Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only" are transferable by indorsement to a third party, but the collecting bankerhas to exercise the reasonable care of a prudent banker to satisfy himself that the named payee has authorised collection for theindorsee. The burden of proving the absence of negligence is on the banker, <i>Midland Bank v Reckitt</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1933%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1933] A.C. 1</a>, 14, and is, "no doubt heavy", per Cairns L,J. in <i>Marfani</i>, 980D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p491" class="pseudopara" id="p491">491.</a> In the context of cases involving the collection of third party cheques with markings, "A/C Payee Only" (or words to the like effectsuch as "Payee Account Only", which featured in the Hong Kong case I am about to cite), those appearing for Zanda were correct topray in aid the observation of Rigby, J. in <i>Asiatic European Corporation Ltd v. Overseas Trust Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20HKLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] HKLR 1</a> at p.3 "that a collecting banker which ignores a cheque endorsed 'Payee Account Only' does so at his peril," but that does not takereally the matter very far, since it does not define what the "peril" is to which the collecting bank is exposed in such circumstances.The peril faced is not that of an absolute duty, but, rather, the qualified duty owed by the collecting bank to the true owner, unders.86, of exercising-reasonable care in all the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p492" class="pseudopara" id="p492">492.</a> Needless to say, one of the salient circumstances to which the collecting banker must pay heed in his endeavour to discharge theonus on him of satisfying a court that he acted without negligence is the fact of a crossing such as "Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only".A crossing like that puts a careful banker on enquiry. The actual enquiries the banker will need to make if he is to be absolvedrrom negligence must depend on the actual circumstances of the case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p493" class="pseudopara" id="p493">493.</a> The collecting banker is entitled, in an appropriate case, to rely on information he has gathered from past enquiries. The significanceof past enquiries is dealt with by Diplock L J in <i>Marfani</i>, p.972H:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">" Any antecedent inquiries which he may have made are relevant only in so far as they have already brought to his knowledge factswhich a careful banker ought to ascertain about his customers before accepting for collection the cheque which is the subject-matterof the action and so relieved him of any need to ascertain them again when the cheque which is the subject-matter of the action isdelivered to him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p494" class="pseudopara" id="p494">494.</a> So far as Bank of America is concerned, judged by the standard of a careful banker I would not have expected it to make any furtherenquiries in relation to the disputed cheque for $5 million presented to it on 7th September 1983. Mr Arthur Lee already had deepknowledge, gleaned over an eighteen month period, about his customer, and he also knew all he could reasonably have been expectedto know about Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p495" class="pseudopara" id="p495">495.</a> He knew that Asean owned 50% of Zanda, and that Asean had helped finance Zanda's building project, so there was nothing unnaturalor unusual about Zanda indorsing over the proceeds .of the cheque to Asean.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p496" class="pseudopara" id="p496">496.</a> There was also the circumstance that Asean was a D.T.C., a type of financial institution likely to have money placed with it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p497" class="pseudopara" id="p497">497.</a> Moreover, Mr Arthur Lee, at the time, was actually expecting a cheque for the Zanda sale proceeds from Tai Ting Estates to be depositedby Asean with Bank of America. Mr Alexis Chan had laid the groundwork for Asean to be in possession of this cheque, with a crediblestory about paying Bank of America $10 million of the Zanda proceeds as soon as the sale went through on the issue of a Letter ofCompliance to Zanda. I have explained earlier how, in my view, the circumstance that Asean paid in a cheque for $5 million, ratherthan the $10 million Mr Alexis Chan had spoken of earlier, was not such as reasonably to raise any suspicion on Bank of America'spart that Asean might be stealing Zanda's money.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p498" class="pseudopara" id="p498">498.</a> Nor do I think the circumstance that the cheque was indorsed over to Asean by Ms Stephenie Chan alone, purportedly on behalf of Zanda,should have raised doubt in his mind over what Asean was doing. He knew Ms Stephenie Chan was personal secretary to Mr Alexis Chanand Mr Jesse Perez. What Ms Stephenie Chan was doing was obviously all right with both Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez: it wastotally consistent with what the latter pair had led Bank of America to believe was going to happen with some of the proceeds fromthe Zanda completion. The matter would have been very different, of course; if Ms Stephenie Chan had tried to pay the proceeds ofthe $5 million cheque into her own personal account, but her part in paying Zanda money into an Asean account was in no way suspicious.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p499" class="pseudopara" id="p499">499.</a> True, Asean, to Bank of America's knowledge, held only a 50% stake in Zanda, and Bank of America must have known that Zanda wouldin all probability have had other creditors besides Asean. Should that knowledge have made a prudent banker wary of collecting a"Not Negotiable A/C Payee Only" cheque for Asean? I do not think so, in the light of Bank of America's overall knowledge of Aseanand Zanda generally, and in relation to the information it had, in particular, about the disputed cheque.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p500" class="pseudopara" id="p500">500.</a> It was only if Bank of America might reasonably have had some inkling that Asean might be.trying to cheat Zanda's other creditorsand shareholders that Bank of America's knowledge of the existence of those other shareholders and creditors would assume some significancein the context of the issue whether Bank of America had acted in the manner of a prudent banker in collecting this cheque.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p501" class="pseudopara" id="p501">501.</a> Is the fact that Bank of America failed to direct any fresh enquiries to Asean or Zanda before collecting the cheque indicative ofnegligence on the banks' part? I think not for two reasons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p502" class="pseudopara" id="p502">502.</a> Firstly, depending on the circumstances, it does not necessarily constitute lack of reasonable care on the part of a banker to refrainfrom making enquiries which it is improbable would lead to detection of the customer's dishonest purpose, if he is dishonest, andwhich are likely to offend him, and may be drive him away, if he is honest. To use Diplock L.J.'s precise words from <i>Marfani</i>, p.977B &amp; C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt does not constitute any lack of reasonable care to refrain from making inquiries which it is improbable will lead to detectionof the potential customers dishonest purpose if he is dishonest, and which are calcuated to offend him and maybe drive away his customif he is honest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p503" class="pseudopara" id="p503">503.</a> I think it reasonable for Bank of America to suppose that Mr Alexis Chan, and Mr Jesse Perez would be likely to take umbrage if Bankof America's staff had phoned them up enquiring whether Asean was really entitled to the proceeds of the $5 million where Zanda wasshown as the payee cheque. At that stage, there was nothing to suggest that Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez were dishonest. Infact, all the information available to Bank of America pointed the other way. Any honest man who had been dealing with a bank aslong as Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez, on behalf of Asean, had been dealing with Bank of America would have resented any enquiryinsinuating he might be trying to get money to which his company might not be entitled.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p504" class="pseudopara" id="p504">504.</a> An honest man would be even more indignant if his bank went behind his back making enquiries of the payee of a cheque to see whetherthe bank's customer was acting honestly. Once news of that got back to the customer (who, I am assuming, is honest), he would beoutraged. Like Diplock L.J. in <i>Marfani</i> at p.974B, I think a banker is entitled to presume his customer is in all probability honest unless and until there are indicationsto the contrary. In the present case, there was a mountain of information leading Bank of America, as at 7th September 1983, to believeMr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez were men of integrity, and not even a molehill suggesting otherwise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p505" class="pseudopara" id="p505">505.</a> Over forty years before the 1968 - <i>Marfani</i> decision, Scrutton L.J. in A.L. <i>Underwood Ltd v Bank of Liverpool</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%201%20KB%20775" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] 1 KB 775</a>, expressed the view that, if bankers wanted the luxury of not offending their customers in connection with the collection of thirdparty cheques by enquiring into any unusual circumstances; they must pay the price for that in the form of being liable to the trueowner if it turned out the bank's customer was dishonest. Mr Richard Mills-Owen, Q.C., for Zanda, relied on that authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p506" class="pseudopara" id="p506">506.</a> I think <i>Marfani</i> represents the modem law on the consequences of not offending a customer whose honesty is not in question, and I am following it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p507" class="pseudopara" id="p507">507.</a> The second of my reasons why I do not think Bank of America's failure to make enquiries of Asean and/or Zanda about the cheque indispute points towards negligence is that even if they had made enquiries, it is improbable they would have exposed Asean's dishonesty.This is really a causation point. The principle to be applied is found in the following passage from Diplock L.J., in <i>Marfani</i> at p.976H :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"Failure to make the inquiries was not causative of the loss. There are dicta, which can be found collected in <i>Baker v. BarcIays Bank Ltd</i>, which suggest that, even if it could be proved that a failure to make a particular inquiry which a prudent banker would have madehad had no causative effect upon the loss substained by the true owner, the banker would nevertheless be disentitled to the protectionof section 4 of the Cheques Act, 1957. For my part, I think that those dicta are wrong.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p508" class="pseudopara" id="p508">508.</a> Cairns L.J. in the same case, at p.980C expressed the same idea as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"In my opinion, if the bank can show that in all probability a particular precaution would have been unavailing, the failure to takethat precaution is not such negligence as deprives them of the protection."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p509" class="pseudopara" id="p509">509.</a> Applying that approach to the present case, from the point of view of trying to get at the truth, it would, obviously, have beenpointless on 7th September 1983 for Bank of America to address inquiries to either Mr Alexis Chan or Mr Jesse Perez about the chequein dispute. They would simply have told Bank of America plausible lies consistent with the major substratum of truth about Aseailhaving helped financed the development, about how the completion monies were being paid in different tranches, how, commencing withthe payment by cheque of the initial deposit of $4.1 million by Tai Ting Estates on 3rd September 1981, all the cheques had beenin the same form and endorsed over by Zanda in blank, and how it was the wish of all shareholders in Zanda that all monies due fromTai Ting Estates to Zanda, including the completion monies, were to be deposited with Asean to payoff creditors and then distributethe balance to shareholders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p510" class="pseudopara" id="p510">510.</a> If Bank of America had, on 7th September 1983, contacted either Mr S.Y. Ho or Mr S.Y. Leung, enquiring whether it was all right tocollect the $5 million cheque for Asean, I am satisfied, for reasons I expressed earlier in this judgment, that both of them wouldhave said it was all right, being what Zanda wanted. All along, Mr S.Y. Ho and Mr Jesse Perez, the directors of Zanda, contemplatedand intended that all payments from Tai Ting Estates for Zanda should be channelled through Asean. Zanda's alternate directors, insofaras they thought about it at all, wanted the same thing. It is difficult to see how Bank of America can be regarded as having failedin its duty of care towards Zanda, when it was doing the very thing Zanda wanted, namely, collecting Zanda's cheque for Asean. Thisfeature of the case will be highly relevant when I come to consider contributmy negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p511" class="pseudopara" id="p511">511.</a> In my view, failure by Bank of America to raise enquiries with Asean and/or Zanda would have made no difference to the course Bankof America took in collecting this cheque, so cannot be regarded as causative of Zanda's loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p512" class="pseudopara" id="p512">512.</a> A point was made for Zanda against Bank of America in the context of negligence that it lacked guidelines for its staff on how todeal with third party cheques. As will be seen, the point was taken against Barclays, which did have guidelines, that it did notfollow them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p513" class="pseudopara" id="p513">513.</a> It was suggested on behalf of Zanda that, bearing in mind that Bank of America is a United States bank, and that in the United States,crossings never feature on cheques, there might, therefore, be grounds for supposing that officers in the Hong Kong branches of Bankof America did not fully understand the significance of crossings on cheques, and were in no position to reach the standard expectedof careful bankers in Hong Kong when it came to dealing with third party cheques. The impression I gained from the evidence of MrArthur Lee, the Bank of America Account Officer who approved the collection of the disputed cheque by Bank of America, was that hehad a good working-knowledge of third party cheques, and knew as much about them as one would expect of officers of equivalent rankin banks of English origin. None of his former colleagues who gave evidence left me with the impression of being handicapped in hislevel of understanding of good practice in processing third party cheques, compared with his opposite numbers in banks in Hong Kongwhich have a predominantly English background.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p514" class="pseudopara" id="p514">514.</a> My conclusion in relation to the defence raised by Bank of America in reliance on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a> is that it succeeds, smce there was nothing to arouse suspicion on the part of Bank of America's staff that Asean was not the trueowner of the cheque for $5 million being tendered for collection on 7th September 1983, and I am satisfied that Bank of America hasdischarged the onus it bore of showing the collection was without negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p515" class="pseudopara" id="p515">515.</a> Turning now to the position of Barclays under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a>, there was a total lack of positive evidence adduced by it to support its plea of absence of negligence in the way it collected thedisputed cheque for $1 million presented by its customer, Asean, on 7th September 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p516" class="pseudopara" id="p516">516.</a> There was nothing to show Barclays had taken any steps to familiarize itself with the underlying real estate transaction giving riseto this cheque, and with the state of the relationship between Zanda and Asean as at 7th September, 1983.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p517" class="pseudopara" id="p517">517.</a> There can be no doubt that the Hong Kong staff of Barclays trusted Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez at that date - too much so -but that by itself would not absolve Barclays from the duties expected of a careful banker towards the payee when collecting a thirdparty cheque for a customer. Although the amount of the cheque was small in the context of the long-standing relationship betweenBarclays and its customer, it was, all the same, not negligible, and the onus was on Barclays to show that, in the difficult financialconditions obtaining in Hong Kong at that time, it did not, in its anxiety to reduce Asean's overdraft, fall short of the standardexpected of careful bankers in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p518" class="pseudopara" id="p518">518.</a> It so happened that Barclays had guidelines to try to live up to.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p519" class="pseudopara" id="p519">519.</a> One guideline issued to Barclays staff provided (Trial Bundle B, pp.102 and 104) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"Circumstances in which a Bank may be held negligent as a collecting bank â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(h) collecting, without enquiry, a cheque for the account of a company, the cheque being payable to another company. In this caseif the Bank is aware of circumstances which indicate that the transaction is bona fide, enquiry might not be essential; but otherwiseit is advisable to obtain the authority of the payee company independently given."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(As p.1 02 is missing from my Trial Bundle B, I have had to recreate this guideline, as best I can, from p.1587 of my record.).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p520" class="pseudopara" id="p520">520.</a> Bank guidelines are in the nature of counsels of perfection, and failure to live up to them is not necessarily fatal to a bank'saverment it has not been negligent (see <i>Motor Traders Guarantee Corporation Ltd v. Midland Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%204%20All%20ER%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 4 All ER 90</a>, 96). That said, deviation by a bank from the practice embodied in a guideline it has laid down for itself will be strong prima facieevidence of negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p521" class="pseudopara" id="p521">521.</a> On the evidence as it stands, I cannot be satisfied that Barclays' personnel conformed with the practice described in the guidelineI have just set out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p522" class="pseudopara" id="p522">522.</a> There are other Barclays' guidelines which Barclays' staff might, or might not, have followed on 7th September 1983 in relation tothe cheque in dispute. I now set them out (Trial Bundle B, pp.102, 104 &amp; 107):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"Circumstances in which a Bank may be held negligent as a collecting bank â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c) collecting a cheque crossed 'Account Payee' for an account other than that of payee."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Account Payee' Crossing</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Some years before 1876 drawers of cheques, on their own initiative, had devised another method of making cheques secure from theftand fraud. They began to cross their cheques with the words 'For the account of â¦' or 'Account payee'. When the Crossed ChequesBill, 1876, was being debated in Parliament, an amendment was moved which provided that where a cheque was crossed generally or specially,a lawful holder might add to the crossing the words âfor account ofâ, or any abbreviation thereof, followed by the names of thepersons or company to whose account he wished the cheque to be credited. The amendement was withdrawn, and to this day there is noreference to that crossing or to the 'account payee' crossing in any Act of Parliament.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">This does not mean, however, that the crossings are without legal significance. The relevant decisions of the courts in regard tothe collection of cheques so crossed are examined elsewhere. The position may be summarised by stating that bankers will not usuallycollect cheques so crossed for someone other than the payee or the person designated in the crossing, though exceptions are occasionallymade, particularly if the cheque is for a small amount and the customer is one of long standing. The paying banker, however, is notconcerned with these crossings; for, as Bigham, J., once observed, the words 'account A. B.' are a mere direction to the receivingbank as to how the money is to be dealt with after receipt.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The 'Safest' Crossing</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">On 3rd October, 1957, the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales issues a statement recommending thatcheques be crossed 'Not negotiable. Account payee only'. This combination of the 'not negotiable' crossing with the words 'accountpayee only' is clearly prudent. The two crossings serve different purposes. The 'not negotiable' crossing takes the cheque out ofthe category of negotiable instruments with the advantage to the drawer which has already been explained. The 'account payee' crossingdoes not take the cheque out of the category of negotiable instruments. This crossing is addressed to the collecting banker and ineffect it warns the collecting banker that if he collects the cheque for someone other than the payee and that person is not entitledto it, the banker may be liable in damages to the person who was entitled to it. The 'not negotiable' crossing does not imply anysuch warning. Thus, by combining the 'not negotiable' crossing with the words 'account payee', the drawer enjoys a two-fold advantage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p523" class="pseudopara" id="p523">523.</a> A point with which one could take issue is the assertion in the 'guideline that, ''Not negotiable, A/C Payee only" is the safestcrossing. An even safer crossing on a cheque would be âNot transferableâ. A similar result can be brought about by adding theword âonlyâ after the payeeâs name. See Asia Business law Review, 1993, No.1 at pp57 to 60. Banks do not, however, like thehighly effective, âNot Transferableâ crossing, nor the insertion of, âonlyâ after the payeeâs name on a cheque, since theywill then almost certainly lose the protection of s.86 if they make a collection for other than the true owner.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p524" class="pseudopara" id="p524">524.</a> As many a litigant has found out, too late, to his cost, the so-called âsafest crossingâ, âNot Negotiable A/C Payee Onlyâ,is not really all that safe, since the cheque still remains transferable, and a bank which collects for a party, other than the namedpayee, can escape liability to the true owner under s.86 if it can prove it acted in good faith and without negligence. Paying banksenjoy similar avenues of escape: (See <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.60</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">80</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s83.html" class="autolink_findacts">83</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a>).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p525" class="pseudopara" id="p525">525.</a> Small comfort accrues to Zanda from Barclaysâ failure, as collecting bank in the present case, to establish it acted without negligencesince, on the view I take, Barclaysâ negligence was not the cause of Zandaâs loss. The cause was the arrangement assented toby all those involved in directing Zanda that Asean should collect and hold, pending distribution, all the proceeds arising fromthe sale by Zanda to Tai Ting Estates. Such assent by Mr S.Y. Ho, and Mr Eddie Leung, as well as, of course, by Mr Jesse Perez isan inescapable inference from the evidence as a whole on how Zanda and Asean conducted their affairs. It must also be regarded asthe wish of Ms Stephenie Chan during the short time she was alternate director of Zanda. With no idependent view of her own, shedid whatever Mr Jesse Perez and Mr Alexis Chan, (Who were ad idem on the affairs of Zanda), asked her to do in connection with Zanda.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p526" class="pseudopara" id="p526">526.</a> On reading many of the reported cases where banks have won by resort to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a> (or Englandâs <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the cheques Act 1957), I get the feeling, at one level, the loser finished up at the receiving end of some rather rough justice.<i>Marfani</i> is a case in point. There the drawer, a comparatively small company, which had done all that might reasonably have been expectedof it to guard against loss, nonetheless finished up as an innocent victim of the banking system, while Midland Bank, which no doubt,is in part responsible for, and does very nicely out of that same banking system, got to keep the money. At another level, I canunderstand that, for reasons of high policy concerning allocation of risk, and commercial expediency, banks do need protection inview of the vast volume of cheques passing through their hands.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p527" class="pseudopara" id="p527">527.</a> No one need feel any qualms for Zanda on the facts of the present case. Both law and justice are on the side of the Defendant-banks.Zanda clearly intended that all the sale monies from Tai Ting Estates should be deposited with Asean, and that is what in fact happened.To have to hold against the Defendant-banks in favour of Zanda in the situation where the banks had conducted themselves in the veryway Zanda intended them to act would not be an attractive outcome.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>3.

Really, itis I a misuse of language to describe the conduct of Zanda's directors and alternate directors as "negligent" on the material mattersbringing about the state of affairs which led to the Defendant-banks being able to collect the proceeds of the cheques in disputefor Asean. What the directors and alternate directors of Zanda did was deliberately and intentionally to set up the arrangement toenable Asean's bankers to collect cheques made payable to Zanda arising from the land sale to Tai Ting Estates. The very result happenedwhich all the directors and alternate directors of Zanda wanted to happen: Asean's bankers collected the proceeds of the disputedcheques for Asean. In such circumstances, I regard Zanda as one hundred per cent contributorily negligent, so it gets nothing onits claim against either Defendant-bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p535" class="pseudopara" id="p535">355.</a> Of course, later, a further consequence ensued which neither Mr S.Y. Ho nor Mr Eddie Leung wanted to happen, namely, Mr Alexis Chanand Mr Jesse Perez running off with the money for which Asean should, in due course, have accounted to Zanda, but that was anotherevent for which neither of the Defendant-banks was in any way responsible in the eyes of the law. That was wholly the fault of Zandain the same way it was wholly Zanda's own fault (if fault it be) that the cheques payable to Zanda by Tai Ting Estates could be collectedfor Asean.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>4. Estoppel</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p354" class="pseudopara" id="p534">534.</a> Because of, firstly, Zanda's alleged slowness in alerting the Defendant-banks to the dishonest conduct of Mr Alexis Chan and Mr JessePerez in causing the Defendant-banks to collect the disputed cheques on 7th September 1983, and, secondly, Zanda's informing theDefendant-banks on 17th March 1984 they need not make enquiries concerning those same cheques but then saying they should on 12thMay 1984, it was contended, on behalf of the Defendant-banks, that Zanda was estopped from suing on the cheques, since Zanda's conductin effect amounted to a representation that it intended the proceeds of the cheques to be collected by Asean, and the Defendant-bankswere prejudiced by this since they lost the opportunity of taking early recovery action against Asean and its guarantors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p535" class="pseudopara" id="p535">535.</a> I have already dealt with this in my findings of fact in relation to Asean, Mr Alexis Chan, and Mr Jesse Perez, my conclusion beingthat if Zanda had allowed the truth concerning Asean, Mr Alexis Chan and Mr Jesse Perez to emerge earlier, it would have availedthe Defendant-banks nothing, since they then would have been no better off than the rest of the huge throng of Asean's creditorswhich would all have stampeded to get payment at the same time. Time was to show that Asean had liabilities of over $160 millionand assets in the $3 million region, so the prospect of any significant recovery by the Defendant-banks was somewhat less than roseate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p536" class="pseudopara" id="p536">536.</a> Insofar as Mr Johnny Cheng, as Asean's guarantor was concerned, I regard it as unlikely that any more money could have been extractedfrom him beyond what he paid Bank of America in January and February 1984. Once government took over Hang Lung Bank at the end ofSeptember 1983, the impression I get is he was strapped for cash. He looks to have been at his last gasp financially, paying Bankof America $1.7 million in January and February 1984 by post-dated cheques.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p537" class="pseudopara" id="p537">537.</a> The estoppel plea on behalf of the Defendant-banks struck me as somewhat contrived, and it is just as well for them they do not needto rely on it in the light of my findings against the plaintiff on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 86</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/19" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Ordinance</a>, and on contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>5. Equitable Defence</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p538" class="pseudopara" id="p538">538.</a> Those appearing for the Defendant-banks found themselves beset by the following conundrum which they thought would arise were thecourt to find against their clients. Asean would not only have wrongfully kept the proceeds it should have held trom the disputedcheques for Zanda, but, owning 50% of Zanda, would also stand to get the benefit of 50% of any judgment monies recovered by Zanda,a result at which Equity would stand aghast, so it was argued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p539" class="pseudopara" id="p539">539.</a> The problem I think is more imaginary than real. Those appearing for the Defendant-banks thought only of lifting the veil on Zandato reveal its shareholders amongst which is Asean, but, at the same time, wanted to keep Asean's veil firmly down, thus hiding fromview its creditors owed over $160 million. In such a situation Equity, even-handed as ever, requires either that both veils be liftedor both remain drawn. Then the problem disappears.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p540" class="pseudopara" id="p540">540.</a> In view of the foregoing, Zanda's claim against Bank of America and its claim against Barclays is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span>(J.J.
