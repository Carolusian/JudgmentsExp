Her case is that $9.5 million, comprising three separate payments of $1.5 million, $4 million and a further payment of $4 millionwere loans repayable on demand.  The balance of the claim, in the total sum of $8.3 million, was extorted out of her by means ofthreats that unless she paid what he asked for he would publish photographs and video of them having sexual intercourse which wouldbe brought to the attention of her wealthy boyfriend by whom she has two young children.  It is said by her that she felt obligedto pay him $8.3 million, paid in five separate payments.  These were one of $1.5 million, another of $2 million, a third of $2.5million, a fourth of $300,000 and finally one of $2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Before I set out the background to all of this, suffice it to say for the moment that the Defendantâs pleaded case is that allof these substantial payments were gifts to him, which are not repayable, arising out of their relationship, although he acceptsthat if he made any substantial profit out of the various amounts of money given to him by the Plaintiff, it was tacitly recognisedthat he might be expected to repay what she had given to him.  Nevertheless, that possibility was not one that would ever be expectedto give rise to any legal obligation on his part to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Defendant has a counterclaim against the Plaintiff for damages to be assessed for malicious prosecution.  The Plaintiff saysthat eventually she plucked up sufficient courage to report the Defendant to the police for blackmail.  She gave them a witness statementbased on which the Defendant was arrested and held in custody for 48 hours before being bailed.  Eventually, having taken legal advicethe police decided to withdraw the prosecution and the Defendant was unconditionally released.  The Defendant says that the Plaintifflied to the police who then arrested him based on completely false allegations.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defendant says that what caused the Plaintiff to turn against him in this way was that he decided to marry his girlfriend, amuch younger woman than the Plaintiff, and that these false allegations, now repeated at the trial, are motivated by the Plaintiffâsdesire to exact revenge because he had decided to terminate their relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In its briefest outline, this is what the action is all about.  Itâs outcome must largely depend on whose evidence I accept.</p>    <p class="heading">The Partiesâ Relationship</p>    <p><i>(i) The engagement of the defendant to investigate the Plaintiffâs boyfriend</i></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiffâs long-term boyfriend is a wealthy and well-known Hong Kong businessman.  He lives with his wife and children. ThePlaintiff, whose was born in 1962, came to Hong Kong from the Mainland, in 1979 when she was 17 years old.  Initially, she workedin a factory but then trained to become a beautician.  She found employment in a hotel and it was there that she met her boyfriend. She entered into a relationship with him and now has two children by him aged 13 and 10.  She lives alone with her children.  Since1996, she has acquired sufficient capital to make investments of her own on the Mainland.  These investments, which include an interestin a hotel, are operated by friends of herâs and she is able to get a return on the profits as a result which she has become independentlywealthy.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In 2005, she had reason to suspect that her boyfriend was having an affair with another woman.  She decided to have him investigatedto see if her suspicions were true.  A friend of herâs, a Miss Hui, introduced her to the Defendant who was working as a debt collectorand private investigator.  Miss Hui had used his services in the past and must have found him suitable to introduce to the Plaintiff. He met the Plaintiff and Miss Hui at a hotel in Tsimshatsui East and discussed her problem with her.  He gave her his business card[A1/112] which described him as a âLegal Consultantâ working with the Kam Ho Investigation Company.  She asked him about hischarges and he said it would cost her $70,000.  She gave him details of her boyfriendâs telephone number which he was then ableto monitor and pass on to her a log of his incoming and outgoing calls.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Later on as his investigation went further he showed her a video recording of the woman that she suspected was her boyfriendâsnew girlfriend.  This showed the woman naked in bed on various occasions with other men having sex with them.  The Defendant saidthat it would cost her a further $400,000 for him to provide video evidence of her boyfriend with this woman which he could obtainfor her.  He said that he was able to hide a camera and film them whilst they were having sex.  For this fee he could also put herboyfriend under pressure by releasing details of his extra-marital activities to the press.  She says that she was rather confusedabout what she really wanted from the Defendant but in the end she paid him the additional $400,000 for these further investigations. She could not remember if she paid $400,000 in one or two instalments but she did give him the additional $400,000.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  After she had made this payment, she became frightened by what the Defendant was capable of doing to her boyfriend.  She changedher mind because she did not want him to go that far and so instructed him to stop his investigation which he did.  She did not askfor the $400,000 to be repaid to her.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Although she had no further use for his professional services, she says that he continued to telephone her.  According to her, heshowed concern for her and was worried that she might become bored if her boyfriend was neglecting her.  He said she should go outa bit.  She says that she was unhappy at the time and started seeing the Defendant socially.  They would go for walks and for drivesin his motorcar.  He would call her frequently and they started a sexual relationship although their sexual encounters were far andfew between.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Defendantâs version as to the nature and intensity of their relationship differs markedly from herâs.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  He says that he was 24 or 25 years old when he first met the Plaintiff through the introduction of Miss Hui.  He was a debt collectorat the time.  He accepted the instruction to investigate her boyfriend in order to discover whether he had another girlfriend.  Hedid this for one or two months and would regularly report to the Plaintiff on what he had found out.  He says that she paid him $400,000for his services given in two instalments.  As a result of their frequent contact they became friendly. He would call her by herEnglish name and she called him Wai Chai.  They would meet on 4 or 5 occasions in the course of a week and he also provided her withreports over the telephone.  She had given him the name of the woman that she suspected her boyfriend to be having an affair with. He says that he took no photographs nor did he have any video recording of the woman concerned.  He says that he was not a professionalprivate investigator and the Plaintiff knew that when she engaged him.  After a while she told the Defendant that she had decidedto break-up with her boyfriend and asked the Defendant to stop his investigation which he did.</p>    <p>(ii) The Relationship After the Termination of the Investigation of the Boyfriend</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiffâs evidence is that after she started to go out with the Defendant, he began to call her repeatedly.  This was inabout August and September 2005.  She says that they had sex on about five or six occasions. They would usually go to a hotel forthat purpose.  She says that the last time that they had sex was at the end of 2005.  She also says that there were no feelings ofaffection between them and anyway, he already had a girlfriend which she knew about.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In about September and October 2005, he started to borrow money from her.  Firstly, he asked her to lend him $1.5 million to helphim register a company.  Her evidence is that he told her that he would repay her at the rate of $150,000 a month.  He told her thathe was going to establish a âfinancial companyâ.  She transferred the $1.5 million from her HSBC account to his account on 8October 2005.  After she had transferred the money she said that he would call her frequently and that they would go out from timeto time.  Despite his promise to repay her at the monthly rate of $150,000 he paid nothing.  He said that his new company was notmaking anything. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In late November or early December 2005, he told her that he was having family problems.  His brother-in-law in Australia had beenarrested for drug trafficking.  At the start of December, by which time he had repaid nothing of the first loan, he met her at HungHom and brought a young child with him who he said was his sisterâs son.  He told her that he wanted all the family to be togetherat Christmas and that he needed $4 million to use as bail money for his brother-in-law [the childâs father] in Australia.  Shesays that she was moved on seeing the child.  She has children of her own.  She told him that she would lend him the $4 million sothat his brother-in-law could be released from custody.  On 8 December 2005, she transferred this amount from her HSBC account tohis account.  She says that he took the money and went to Australia to arrange bail.  He told her that he needed to remain in Australiafor some time.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The way she described the Defendantâs absence in Australia was that he âneeded to guardâ his brother-in-law meaning, I presume,that as his surety he needed to see to it that he attended court when required to.  She said that he kept calling her for more money. At the beginning of January 2006, after she had told him that she now wanted the $4 million back, he said that his brother-in-lawhad absconded and he could not get the money back to her. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The following month, in February 2006, he told the Plaintiff that he was having problems with his company and was in no positionto return the money to her.  Shortly after that he telephoned her again to say that his partners were withdrawing from the businessand that he needed a further $4 million to buy them out.  In mid-February 2007, she did as he asked and transferred a further $4million to his account.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  That payment meant that in the course of just over four months, the Plaintiff had, on her account, lent the Defendant who she hadmet only a few months earlier, $9.5 million.  On his version, as I will relate in a moment, these were gifts stemming from theirsexual relationship, with a vague understanding that if he made any money out of these gifts, mostly used to fund business ventures,he might re-pay the capital to her.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The next phase, which lasted from 14 August 2006 until 11 October 2007, relates to five further payments made by the Plaintiff tothe Defendant totalling $8.3 million which the Plaintiff says were the result of blackmail by him.  These payments, all agreed bythe Defendant as having been received by him, were on 14 August 2006 for $1.5 million, the 25 September 2006 for $2 million, the28 December 2006 for $2.5 million, a payment in cash of $300,000,000 in either May or June 2007 and finally, a payment of $2 millionon 29 August 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Her evidence is that he telephoned her in June 2006, this being about four months after the previous payment to him of $4 million. She has described what followed as a nightmare.  They went out.  He told her that he had been having problems with his company. Earlier, she says in March or April 2006, she had tried to press him for repayment of what she had lent to him.  She telephonedhis office number.  She left a message and he called her back.  He was furious with her because she had telephoned and because shehad asked for repayment.  He threatened to make trouble for her with her boyfriend by telephoning him at the massage establishmentthat he used to go to.  He also told her that he had video evidence of them having sex and asked whether she wanted this materialreleased to her boyfriend for him to see.  When she heard these threats, she became frightened.  She dared not press him furtherfor repayment of what she had lent him.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In June or July 2006, he telephoned her again. He told her that he would repay her soon.  Shortly afterwards he drove her to anopen piece of land at Sham Tseng.  He said he wanted to buy it to operate as a car park.  In that way, he might be able to repayher.  In order to purchase the site, he said that he needed $1.5 million.  She told him that she had no more money â that she hadlent him all that she had.  He responded to this by reminding her that he had kept the video recordings of them together.  As shegave this evidence, she began to cry, about which I will have more to say when I assess the evidence of both of them.  Fearing thathe would show the video evidence to her boyfriend, she transferred a further amount of $1.5 million to him.  This transfer, it isagreed, took place on 14 August 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  She told me that a month later, he telephoned her again saying that he needed a further $2 million from her for work to be doneon the site at Sham Tseng.  She told him that she had no money but he persisted and threatened her again, using the same threat torelease the video to her boyfriend.  She became so frightened that she let him have the money which she transferred to him on 25September.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In December 2006, she said that he telephoned her, on this occasion from England.  He told that he had carried out some work inEngland for a criminal gang and that he was returning to Hong Kong by ship (I presume by cargo vessel) in order to avoid detection. He had alot of sterling with him and needed HK$2.5 million to exchange for the Sterling.  He told her that he would repay her indue course.  She tried to resist paying him but again he threatened her and fearing the worst, she felt compelled to transfer $2.5million to his account which she did on 28 December 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  After this payment, she lost contact with the Defendant for sometime after which he contacted her saying that he was encounteringproblems and could not repay her.  This was all at the beginning of 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In the middle of 2007, he telephoned her asking for more money.  On this occasion, he said that he needed $5 million.  The reasonwhy he needed it was that he had accepted a job to find who it was who had splashed red paint at the premises of Mr Cheng Yu Tong(the wealthy businessman) and that he needed to put up a very substantial reward to find out who had done this.  This incident hadbeen reported in the media so she knew about it.  She told him that there was no way by which she could come up with such money. A little later, in May or June 2007, by arrangement they met at Wylie Road, Kowloon.  He told her that he needed money to pay hisstaff their salaries.  She took $300,000 in cash from her safe at home and gave it to him.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The 8th and final payment was on 29 August 2007 which followed a trip that she had taken to Singapore between 1 and 7 August tolook for schools for her children.  She says that before she departed the defendant had approached her to lend him more money.  Shesaid that she needed to go to Singapore to find schools for her children.  He followed her there and on 6 August, they met at herhotel and had a meal at a restaurant across the road.  He told her that he needed $5 million.  She said that she had already raisedthat amount for him and that was all that she could do.  They met the following day.  He gave her the address of his hotel whereshe went to see him.  They had a meal together and did some shopping.  He said that he needed the money so as to raise the rewardin order to final out who had splashed paint at Mr Cheng Yu Tungâs premises.  Later that day, she returned to Hong Kong and threeweeks after that, on 29 August, again under the compulsion of his threats she provided him with a further $2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Matters turned more nasty when she says threatening posters appeared close to her childrenâs school in Hong Kong which she suspectedhad been done by him in order to dissuade from pressing him to repay her and in order to persuade her to give him more money.  Ataround this time, on 7 October, the Defendant came to see her and gave her a puppy which she paid him for.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  At about this time, she also began to receive threatening telephone calls and text messages.  This, combined with what she perceivedwere threats towards her children through the posters put up close to their school, she decided to see a solicitor.  She felt shenow needed to do something about what had been going on.  On 11 October, she reported the Defendant to the police for blackmail. She gave them witness statements on 11 and 15 October [B1/58 and 76].  On 22 October, the police arrested the Defendant at his homewhere he was living with his wife, he having married her on 20 June 2007, and searched the premises.  He was interviewed under cautionby the police at great length on the day of his arrest, the content which I need to consider in due course.  As a result of whatthe Defendant had said in his interview, the police took a further statement from the Plaintiff on the following day the 23 October[B1/97].</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  To complete the chronology, charges were laid against the Defendant on 23 October and the following day he appeared at the magistratescourt where he was bailed.  He had spent two nights in custody.  On 26 October, an <i>ex parte</i> <i>Mareva</i> injunction was obtained from Wright J which I continued on 2 November 2007 freezing such assets as the Defendant had.  On 29 Octoberand on 26 November, the police took a 4th and 5th witness statement from the Plaintiff whilst in the meantime seeking legal advice. As the evidence stood, in terms of any prosecution, the Defendant was denying all suggestions that this very considerable amountof money had been obtained by criminal conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On 18 December, the Defendant answered his bail at the magistrates court and the police told the magistrate that they were offeringno evidence against the Defendant as a result of which he was released unconditionally.  The officer-in-charge of the case has saidthat the charges were dropped following legal advice.  What I get from this is that, in the prosecutionâs view, the evidence wasnot sufficiently strong to secure a conviction.  The Plaintiff has said that it was as a result of threats by text and telephonethat she told the police that she was not prepared to come to court to give evidence.  The officer-in-charge, who gave evidence beforeme, said that he had heard of no report that the Plaintiff, the principal prosecution witness, had said that she was not preparedto come and give evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defence Case As Put to the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Plaintiff has been closely cross-examined by Mr Chu, on the Defendantâs behalf.  The main thrust of the cross-examinationwas that all of this enormous amount of money had been given to the Defendant by her because she wanted to.  These amounts were giftsand in order to keep him she was prepared to give him these amounts so that he might invest them in business ventures related tomoney lending and debt collecting.  It was only after she had returned from Singapore when she learnt that he had married and feelingbetrayed by this she plotted her revenge on him by falsely accusing him of blackmail.  She denied all of this and made the pointthat all along she knew that he had a girlfriend who he intended to marry.  It meant nothing to her that he had a girlfriend.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  She was also questioned on why, if the initial payments were only loans on her version, she did not get him to sign an IOU evidencingthe fact that these payments were loans and not gifts.  She said that it would be embarrassing to get him to sign and IOU.  She wasalso asked why, if these were loans, she did not charge him interest.  She said that she did not know much about such things.  Shewas also asked why there was no fixed time for the repayment of these loans.  She said that he had promised to repay after a month. It was also pointed out to her that she had taken no security for the loans.  She said that she trusted him to repay her.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Chu questioned her about their meetings in Singapore.  As will be seen presently when I consider the Defendantâs evidence,he said that they continued their physical relationship there, her evidence being that he had followed her to Singapore and was demandingmore money from her.  Mr Chu asked why she had failed to mention this Singapore visit to the police in the course of her first twowitness statements and only referred to it after the Defendant had mentioned this to the police in his recorded interview under caution,as a result of which the police asked her about it.  Her explanation for her failure to mention it was that she had forgotten aboutit.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Chu also pointed out to her that in her first affidavit in this action in support of the <i>Mareva</i> injunction, she neglected to mention the visit to Singapore.  She repeated that she had forgotten about it.  Mr Chu put it to herthat she had deliberately suppressed this evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The Defendant, as I will come to presently, told the police that he had in fact repaid the Plaintiff $3 to $4 million.  Mr Chu putthis to her which she said was not true.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As to when she first learnt that the Defendant had married, she said that she first came to know of this at the police station. It had played no part in her reasons for reporting him to the police.  The only reason was that he was blackmailing and threateningher.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As to the prosecution being withdrawn, she repeated in cross-examination that she had told the police that she was not preparedto give evidence which, presumably, was why the police had no option but to offer no evidence against the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendantâs Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The evidence about why and how the parties met, through the introduction of Miss Hui, is not in dispute.  He told me that at thetime he was a debt collector rather than a private investigator.  He says that after a two to three-hour discussion of her problemand suspicions about her boyfriend, he accepted the job of following him.  She paid him $400,000 for his services paid in two instalments. He followed the boyfriend for one or two months and would report back to her on what he had seen.  She had given him the name ofthe suspected girlfriend as well and he just followed and reported back.  When he saw the boyfriend and the girlfriend, he wouldreport this to the Plaintiff by telephone and then he would meet the Plaintiff at night and they would discuss what he had seen inthe course of the day.  As a result of these frequent meetings, four or five times a week, they came to be on friendly terms.  Shecalled him Wai Chai and he would call her by her English name. After about two months, she told him that she had decided to breakup with her boyfriend and called off the investigation, which is what happened.  He had taken no video or photographs of the boyfriendnor had he told her that he could put pressure on the boyfriend.  He says that during his two months investigation, the Plaintiffhad been very unhappy about her relationship with her boyfriend because he was being unfaithful.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  By the time that the investigation finished he and the Plaintiff were on good terms.  She would cook for him and prepare healthysoups.  This was in about July 2005.  He says, âshe was good to me and I treated her wellâ.  He would buy things for her andthey would frequently speak on the telephone.  They would go out for a drive and have drinks together.  He was 24 or 25 years oldand she was 43.  He says that their relationship together, his evidence of which I will relate more fully in a moment, was very goodfrom July 2005 until October 2007, he having married his wife in Australia in June 2007.  When she learnt of the marriage from oneof his colleagues at his office things turned sour.  She refused to speak to him.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  He says that they first had sex in about August 2005.  They would go to hotels.  He has lost count on how often they had a physicalrelationship.  They also had sex at Ocean Pointe, a flat that he had rented.  He first rented this in February 2006 and kept it forabout four or five months.  He told the Plaintiff that he was living with his family at Tuen Mun.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  He was asked in his evidence in chief about the $17.8 million.  He agrees that he accepted each of the payments comprising thistotal.  He says that she asked for his account number and she paid the amounts into it.  He says that she gave him this money todo what he wanted with it in business.  Any business that he wished to start up.  In relation to the first payment of $1.5 million,he says that he wanted to use it to start a debt collecting business.  They discussed it for about two weeks before she transferredthe money into his account on 8 October 2005.  He remembered that it was about the time of his birthday.  There was not much discussion. She said that she wanted to support him.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  As to the $4 million on 8 December 2005, she had told him that she would support him in any business that he wanted to start. Hesays that she gave him this money to do anything with it.  She did not want him to be badly dressed.  He says that using the money,he started to buy expensive clothes and accessories and to gamble heavily.  He bought clothes, watches and gambled in Macau.  Hedid not tell her about that because there was no need to do so.  For her part she never asked him about his business.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As to the second payment of $4 million on 17 February 2006, she told him that she wanted him to buy a flat close to herâs at Homantin. This is what she told him, but there was not much discussion about it.  Once he had the money, he did not buy a flat, instead hewent on a spending binge and gambled.  He bought between six and eight cars.  A Porsche, a BMW, a Mercedes-Benz and a VolkswagenTouareg amongst others.  He also became addicted to gambling.  This is not something that the Plaintiff knew about in the beginning. At this time, they were seeing each other three to four times a week.  They also spoke on the telephone daily.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As to repayment of these enormous amounts of money, he says that this was never spoken of.  There were no terms for repayment, althoughshe did say to him that if he flourished he ought to give her something back.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  One of the projects that he had looked at investing in was renting spaces for car trading.  He found a property at Sham Tseng andhe showed it to her.  He told her that this was what he was planning and she gave him the money.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  He was asked what he knew of her own financial position.  She had told him that her boyfriend had given her shares in an hotel onthe mainland and that she also had two factories on the mainland.  She had to pay $1 million each month in salaries for her employeeson the mainland.  He says that the flat where she was living was worth $30 million.  There was no doubting her wealth.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  He accepts that although she had encouraged him to use the money that she had given him wisely on business ventures, he had gotout of control with his gambling and excessive personal spending.  In the course of their talks, he had discussed with her the possibilityof renting an exhibition hall for motor trading, rather like the project a Sham Tseng that he had spoken of.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  At no time had he threatened her to get money from her.  She was showering him with these large amounts.  Then in August 2007, sheasked him to go to Singapore to keep her company there.  He had been married for two months by then.  He did not want to go withher.  He said it seemed that this would go on forever.  He wanted to break out of this.  He told her that he did not want to go toSingapore, but he used so much of her money that he could not get the upper hand and have his own way.  He had to do as she askedand so he went to Singapore.  Once he got there, they had a meal out together.  Then he went with her to her hotel room where thechildren were sleep.  He had booked another hotel for himself.  The next day, she went to his hotel.  They had some food and wentshopping.  She had told him that if he came to Singapore, there might be a business opportunity for him over there.  She told himthat she had friend who was bankrupt and that people in Singapore owed him money.  He could help and earn money for himself by lookingfor these people. In truth, there was no such person.  He felt that she had made this up to provide him with an incentive to joinher in Singapore.  In the event, they just had fun together and had sex in his hotel room in Singapore.  At this time, she had yetto find out that he was married.  They were still on very good terms.  He had not asked her for any money whilst they were in Singapore.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  When they got back to Hong Kong, she gave him a further $2 million.  He told her that he wanted to set up a company.  This was on29 August 2007. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  On 7 October, he bought her the puppy.  It was a gift.  He had paid for it himself.  It cost $3,800.  She did not reimburse himfor it.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  He explained how she had in addition been extremely generous to him with presents.  Louis Vuitton bags, Hugo Boss shirts, a mobiletelephone, expensive shoes, three Rolex watches.  In all he thinks that she gave him more than 200 gifts.  He sold most of them withina day or two and turned them into cash which he would use to gamble amongst other wasteful expenditure.</p>    <p class="heading">His Arrest</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  He described his arrest on 22 October 2007.  The police arrived at about 6 a.m.  His wife was there.  They searched the home. Theystayed for about 1Â½ hours.  About 10 police officers.  The neighbours saw them.  The police removed $300,000 in cash and his mobiletelephone.  They put him into the police vehicle.  He wore a black hood over his head, but the neighbours knew it was him.  He wasin the custody of the police for 48 hours. Two nights in custody.  He was bailed by the magistrate on 24 October.  Since his arresthe has lived off his savings and has had to work as a hawker in the New Territories.  The mortgage on their home is paid by his wife. She is an accounts clerk.  Since his arrest and the invasive and sensational publicity caused by this case, he has lost his friendsas he has lost his business associates.</p>    <p class="heading">How His Relationship With the Plaintiff Ended</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  He was shown the threatening messages which the Plaintiff has spoken of and had suspected had come from him and been posted closeto her childrenâs school by him or on his behalf.  He denied that he had done any of this.  As to the circumstances of her findingout that he had married his wife, he said that the Plaintiff had gone to his office and that he had been betrayed to her by one ofhis colleagues.  He heard that it was a colleague by the name of Lai Sze Miu.  Miss Hui told him that the Plaintiff had given Laimoney to tell her.  When she learnt of the marriage, the Plaintiff became furious.  He spoke to her to try and explain himself onMiss Huiâs telephone and told that he would return the money to her in order to try and placate her.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Finally, he was asked about his police interview which he accepts is an accurate account of what he told them and that what he toldthem was the truth. </p>    <p class="heading">The Defendantâs Cross-examination</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  A point was developed by Mr Fung, on the Plaintiffâs behalf, that the Defendant knew that he was going to be in trouble with thepolice before his arrest because he knew that he had committed the offences with which he was charged.  Mr Fung based this on thefact that he had consulted solicitors on 1 October and paid $25,000 on account of costs.  This suggestion came as a result of a receipt[B2/415] from those solicitors that he had paid this amount on 1 October.  He denied that this was the case and said that the receipthad been incorrectly dated.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On 1 October, he and his wife had flown to Tokyo and returned to Hong Kong on 5 October when he had to face the music, so to speak,with the Plaintiff who he spoke to from Miss Huiâs telephone.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  As to his relationship with the Plaintiff, he says that he had formed an emotional attachment to her because she was kind and generoustowards him but, he also agreed that the money was a factor.  He was disarmingly frank about what went on between him and the Plaintiff. He had never seen so much money before in his life.  He was worth no more than $400,000 to $500,000 and contemplating marrying hisgirlfriend when he first met the Plaintiff.  He said that he was greedy and liked to spend.  He also liked to gamble and he couldindulge himself with the millions of dollars that the Plaintiff had given him.  It was put to him that he spent these millions becausehe was confident of getting more from her.  He denied that this was so at the beginning but as time went on he felt that she wouldgive him money whatever business he suggested to her that he might wish to start up.  He said that if he did well it would be onlyright that he would return money to her. As things have turned out he has no money.  Whilst accepting that he has been greedy, hesays that he did not deserve to be treated in the way that he has been treated by the Plaintiff who has falsely accused him of seriouscriminal offences and put him through the mill.  Apart from the indignity of his arrest and appearance at the magistratesâ court,he has been hounded by the press.</p>    <p class="heading">The Police Interview</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  This is a lengthy interview which the Defendant stands by.  He was questioned by Mr Fung about certain questions and answers thathe gave to the police.  At Answer 575 [B2/409-410] he said this âI know that I owe her, but I did not borrow money from her formally,I mean I will pay her back.  But with our relationship at the time, there was nothing, that I can see to show that these (<i>sic</i>) money was borrowed from her.  She did not say that, she just said: âAh, take it for your use first, give me only when (you) areable to make moneyâ.  At B2/393-394, he told the police that he had repaid her some money totalling $3 to $4 million.  This hedid in cash.  He had no record of these repayments.  It was put to him by Mr Fung that these passages in particular demonstratedthat he saw an obligation to repay her.  He denied that there was any formal obligation to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">Discussion of the Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  This is a case where I need to proceed with the greatest of care.  On the one hand, it is inherently unlikely that any woman inher right mind would give away $17.8 million simply for the company of and any sexual pleasure that she might obtain from a youngman 20 years younger than her but, this having been said, human nature is such that the most improvident acts of generosity and badjudgment are capable of being committed by individuals when the vast majority of us would strongly counsel against such behaviourand characterise it as quite barmy when measured against ordinary good sense and rational behaviour.  This general view of thingsmust substantially militate against the Defendantâs case that these very large sums of money were gifted to him.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The other side of this, certainly in respect of the $8.3 million allegedly obtained by the Defendant by threats, is that such aserious allegation will require the person making it to provide proof of the most compelling kind.  The basis of this being thatthe more serious the allegation the less likely it is that it was committed, in consequence of which the court will require to bepersuaded by the evidence that what is alleged actually took place.  Whilst the civil standard of proof is applicable, the evidencerequired to satisfy that standard must measure up to the gravity of the allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Ultimately, it is the content of the evidence of the parties that must guide me to a conclusion as to what evidence I accept andwhat I reject.  Nevertheless, in all of this, demeanour must play its part, albeit to a lesser extent.  The court will judge theevidence of a witness based on what he or she has said but also on how the witness has given that evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I observed both of these witnesses with great care as they gave their evidence.  The plaintiff appeared in court wearing a baseballcap, the peak of which she had drawn down tightly across her forehead.  She also wore large very dark sunglasses.  I asked her whethershe wished to wear these whilst she gave her evidence and she said that she did. Understandably, given the nature of this case andthe publicity that it attracted (the press gallery was full), she wished to preserve her anonymity as best she could.  I had alreadydirected that her name on the pleadings and the cause list should be given as âTâ.  As a result of her facial features beingmostly covered up, I could only see her lips move as she spoke but little else of assistance. I did not have the full benefit ofbeing able to have a view of her facial expressions as she gave her evidence.  What she did on a number of occasions, as she gaveher evidence, was to become tearful for a short while before recovering her composure.  I am bound to say that I gained the distinctimpression that the tears were more for effect than a true reflection of any distress on her part as she recollected the events thatshe was speaking of at the time.  My judgment of her was that she was trying to underscore a particular incident by breaking downand crying and by doing so to persuade me that she was speaking the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Defendant on the other hand, who even on his version of events could never emerge with any credit for what he had done â hehad on his case after all made off with $17.8 million of the Plaintiffâs money presumably, because she had developed an extremeemotional and physical attraction for him and he was prepared over a two-year period to take advantage of that.  But on demeanouralone, he presented as a much more believable witness prepared to give a full and frank account of himself and of what he had done. He presented as an open witness who accepted that he was capable of taking and did take these enormous sums of money that he saysthis lady was prepared to ply him with on his say so to her that he wished to invest in vaguely hoped-for business projects whichhe then proceeded to lose on the gambling tables of Macau or on aimless luxury expenditure such as on expensive cars and clothing.His demeanour and body language, as he gave his evidence, carried far more conviction and an air of truthfulness which the Plaintifflacked and, in saying this, I make every allowance that she as I say, quite understandably, gave her evidence well-hidden under abaseball cap and behind large dark sunglasses.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I need to take this demeanour, in each case, into account as I judge the all-important content of their evidence which needs tobe understood against the whole of the relevant background of the case and the inherent likelihood of their conflicting accountsbeing true or otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  My analysis of the partiesâ evidence taken as a whole is that the Plaintiff undoubtedly had become besotted with this youngerhandsome man.  She was perhaps emotionally vulnerable at the time, having decided to break up with her boyfriend who was being unfaithfulto her.  I am satisfied that she was wealthy in her own right through her mainland business interests and decided to take on thisyoung man as a lover who she could indulge with money.  He says that he eventually felt that he became her pet. No doubt in givinghim money she did so for him to use and invest in his own business ventures, instead of which he squandered it aimlessly on gambling,fast cars and expensive clothes.  I am completely satisfied that she never expected that this relatively poor young man was goingto be able to repay her unless by some chance, so remote that I can exclude it, he became wealthy enough out of any business thathe might have ventured into which enabled him to repay her.  This I am satisfied is no basis for any legal obligation by him to repayher.  Whilst the payment of such large sums of money might be presumed to have been paid by her in the expectation that they wouldbe repaid, the evidence in this case has persuaded me that these were outright gifts so that the Plaintiff might indulge herselfin their relationship.  The Defendant told the police that he repaid $3 to $4 million.  On the evidence, I am not able to be sureabout that and I make no finding on this.  Nevertheless, in all the circumstances in which the $17.8 million was paid by the Plaintiffto the Defendant any such repayment would have been purely gratuitous and not indicative of any legal obligation by him to repaywhat she gave him.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Where the evidence of the Plaintiff and the Defendant conflicts, I prefer that of the Defendant.  I am certain that at no time didthe Defendant blackmail the Plaintiff in the way that she has suggested.  Other than her own word, there is no evidence of this. In this regard, the Defendant is entitled to point to the fact that he was closely investigated by the police on the Plaintiffâscomplaint of blackmail.  He was subjected to a comprehensive interview by the police and he denied all the allegations.  The policehave found no other evidence and I am satisfied, that having obtained legal advice, the police decided that they had no case againsthim and released him unconditionally.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  She has said that the reason why the police dropped the case is that she told them that she did not wish to give evidence. Thisin the context of threats that she says she continued to receive.  I reject this account.  The officer in the case, who gave evidencebefore me, has said that he was not told that the Plaintiff was not prepared to give evidence.  I am satisfied that if she reallyhad said so, this officer would have known about it and reported it to those from whom he was taking legal advice.  I am satisfiedthe case was dropped entirely based on the prosecutionâs assessment of its chance of securing a conviction.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  My conclusion is that after the final payment of $2 million, following the return from Singapore, their relationship was still asit had been for the previous two years, although the Defendant who had married by now was trying to break loose from the Plaintiff. It was only in October when she found out that he had married that she turned against him. She felt betrayed and having regard tothe amounts of money that she had plied him with she decided on a course of revenge by making up a false account of blackmail inher report to the police.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  It is significant that she failed to mention the visit to Singapore in her first two witness statements to the police.  This wasrecent and according to her, he had asked her for more money.  Her excuse that she forgot about it is unconvincing in the contextof her claim that the $2 million paid by her on 29 August was referable to his threats in Singapore.  The reason why she did notwant to tell the police is that she might then have to explain what they got up to when they were in Singapore.  The fact is thatshe had invited him to Singapore to keep her company and had sex with him whilst they were there.  His account is truthful and herâsis not.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In making these findings against the Plaintiff and in favour of the Defendant, I have paid great heed to the inherent probabilitiesthat I have already referred to and to the part played by the witnesses demeanour, having given this subsidiary weight as I havedescribed. The facts as they have unfolded have persuaded me of the Defendantâs truthfulness and the Plaintiffâs complete lackof frankness.  Accordingly, I find that the payments comprising the $17.8 million were unconditional gifts and that at no time didthe Defendant threaten the Plaintiff to obtain the latter payments totalling $8.3 million.  In such circumstances, the claim muststand dismissed and there must be judgment for the Defendant on the claim.</p>    <p class="heading">The Counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The simple fact is that on my finding, the Plaintiff gave the police an untruthful account in support of her allegations of blackmailas a result of which the police, who acted with complete propriety throughout, arrested, detained and charged the Defendant beforeoffering no evidence against him two months later.  The elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are described in <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</i> at 16-12:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>(1) The Defendant falsely and maliciously provided information about an alleged crime to a police officer stating willingness to testifyagainst the claimant and in such circumstances and in such a manner as makes it proper to infer that the Defendant desired and intendedthat a prosecution be brought against the claimant.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(2) The circumstances are such that the facts relating to the alleged crime are exclusively within the knowledge of the defendantso that it is virtually impossible for the police officer to exercise any independent discretion or judgment on the matter.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(3)  </i> <i>The conduct of the defendant must be shown to be such that he makes it virtually inevitable that a prosecution will result from thecomplaint.  His conduct is or a nature that ââ¦ if a prosecution is instituted by the police officer the proper view of the matteris that the prosecution has been procured by the complainantâ.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The way it has also been put is that if someone sets in motion the prosecution and misled the police officer, the informant himselfwould be treated as the prosecutor rather than the police.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  It seems to me that this is precisely what has happened here.  These were false witness statements by the Plaintiff causing theDefendantâs arrest, detention and charging by the police.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  All the ingredients of the tort of malicious prosecution have been proved and I will enter judgement for the Defendant on the counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The Defendant had to pay legal expenses in respect of the criminal proceedings laid against him and he must therefore have judgmentfor the amount that he paid those solicitors being the sum of $ 75,000.  This being by way of special damages.  Additionally, hemust be awarded general damages.  The correct approach is that set out by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Thompson v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i> [1998] QB498.  This is a case for a basic award of general damages of a compensatory nature.  In this case, I will have regard tothe humiliating circumstances of the Defendantâs arrest at his home which was seen by his neighbours.  Two nights spent by himin custody.  The worry of the prosecution hanging over his head for two months before he was unconditionally released and the distresscaused by the publicity in circumstances were he has had to endure the close attentions of the press.  He has also lost his previousemployment and is now in less well-paid employment.  Doing my best, I propose to award him general damages of $600,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Interest</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  On special damages interest will be at half the judgment rate from the date of payment of the solicitors fees to the date of judgmentand thereafter at the judgment rate until payment.  On general damages from the date of the writ until judgment at 2% per annum andthereafter at the judgment rate until payment.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  These must be to the Defendant on a party-and-party basis on the claim and on an indemnity basis on the counterclaim.  For the purposeof taxation, I will say that half the costs will relate to the claim and half to the counterclaim.
