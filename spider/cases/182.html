I limit my remarks to the process which led to this matterbeing heard in this Court, nearly 15 years after the 1995 authorization of the reclamation.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  I make my remarks in the light of this dominant fact: From beginning to end, the parties were unable to agree preliminary questionsof law for determination of the claim brought by Pennyâs Bay Investment Company Limited (âPBILâ) for compensation arising outof injurious affection caused by the reclamation. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The claim was lodged by PBIL with the Lands Tribunal back in November 1999.  An application was then made by PBIL to the Tribunalin July 2003 for the determination of preliminary issues arising from its claim.  This was refused.  PBIL then appealed against suchrefusal to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal, in November 2004.  The reason, as Rogers VP explained (see para.18 of hisjudgment in the present appeal) was to avoid unnecessary expense involved in preparing evidence on alternative bases of computation. So the matter went back to the Tribunal and Lam J, the Tribunal President, was constrained to formulate himself 4 preliminary questionsof law, in the absence of agreement between the parties: Questions which counsel on both sides in the appeal before us agreed werenot particularly illuminating or helpful.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The hearing of the âpreliminary issuesâ lasted 7 days, resulting in an order of Lam J dated 25 May 2007 which the Court of Appealset aside.  Paragraph 2 of the Court of Appealâs own order was a declaration as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.      the compensation payable to the Applicant be quantified by assessing and capitalising the diminution in value of Lot No.22 as at 05 May 1995, being the difference between the open market value of the Lot on that date with and without the marine rightsâ namely, the right of access to the sea which were extinguished;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Apart from the word âcapitalisingâ, para.2 is clear enough.  But the Court of Appeal went on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â3. the Lands Tribunal do consider and determine how the following subsequent events are relevant and may be taken into account:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) enjoyment of <i>de facto</i> access to the sea for 6 years and 1 month by the Applicantâs lessee;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) the Governmentâs acquisition of Lot 22 in 2001, by means of voluntary surrender from the Applicant, for a consideration whichreflected the fact that the land no longer enjoyed the right to access the sea;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) <i>ex gratia</i> payment for Lot 22 at the basic rate for building land within Zone A plus 20%;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) the partiesâ agreement that the surrender was made without prejudice to the Applicantâs claim for compensation under the FSROand that the payment <i>will not be taken into account in or prejudice the assessment of the Applicantâs claim under the FSRO.  That is to say, both issuesare delinked one from the other;</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As can be seen, the Court of Appeal determined nothing in para.3.  The question as to whether any of the matters set out in subparas(a) to (d) is ârelevantâ is left to the Tribunal.  So the whole process of determining preliminary questions was in vain.  Thematter might just as well have been left to the Tribunal back in 2003 to determine PBILâs claim for compensation, as best it could. At least an award would have been made, and the entire matter, including the basis for the award, would have had clear focus.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  This case illustrates yet once again the danger inherent in the trial of preliminary issues.  I had adverted to this in <i>Commissioner of Rating &amp; Valuation and Agrila Ltd &amp; Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%204%20HKCFAR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 4 HKCFAR 83</a> at 93.  There, at least, the parties had agreed on the approach. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In my judgment it is seldom if ever helpful to approach issues of law as an academic exercise.</p>    <p><b>Lord Hoffmann NPJ :</b></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Pennyâs Bay lies near the eastern end of Lantau Island.  It is now the site of Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005 andwas built on about 300 hectares of land that had been reclaimed from the waters of the bay.  It has its own MTR station and fastroad connections to Hong Kong Island and the airport.  In 1994, however, it was a remote corner of the coastline, inaccessible exceptfrom the sea or on foot.  The land around the bay was held on the usual New Territories lease, extended to 2047, by Pennyâs BayInvestment Company Limited (âPBILâ).  It was let to a subsidiary which carried on the business of shipbuilding and repairing.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In 1994 the Government produced a scheme for building two container terminals on a large area of land (some 1260 hectares) to bereclaimed from the bay.  It did not need to resume PBILâs land but the effect of the proposed reclamation would have been to preventaccess to sea and put an end to the ship building and repairing business.  In 1995 the Government took the necessary formal stepsto obtain statutory authorisation for the scheme.  As a result of the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127" class="autolink_findacts">Foreshore and Sea-bed (Reclamations) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/127">Cap. 127</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ), which I shall later have to examine in more detail, the authorisation entitled PBIL to make a claimfor compensation for the loss of its access to the sea.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Four years later the Government abandoned the container terminal scheme and decided to promote the Disneyland project instead. In 2000 the 1995 authorisation for reclamation was revoked and authorisation given for reclamation of the somewhat more modest arearequired for Disneyland.  This time PBILâs land was required and in 2001 the Government acquired it by purchasing a surrender ofthe lease.  The question in this appeal is how the compensation which had become payable by virtue of the 1995 authorisation shouldbe calculated and, in particular, the effect (if any) of the subsequent events.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Reclamation has been an important source of building land in crowded Hong Kong for more than 150 years.  Many of its busiest streetsonce lay under the waters of the Harbour.  It has always been recognised that landowners who are adversely affected by interferencewith their rights of access to the sea should be entitled to claim compensation.  Until the Public Reclamation Validation and ClausesOrdinance 1936, the practice appears to have been to include, in every Ordinance which authorised reclamation work, a specific provisionfor compensating owners whose marine rights had been injuriously affected.  So, for example, the Harbour of Refuge Ordinance, No.31 of 1909, which authorised the creation of a harbour of refuge at Yaumati, provided in s.12 that any person who was the owner ofa marine lot which he âdeemed would be injuriously affected by reason of its access to the sea being interfered withâ might makea claim and receive compensation in the discretion of the Governor, with an appeal to the Court.  This provision gave rise to litigationand a reported case (<i>In the matter of an Award of Compensation made by His Excellency the Governor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%207%20HKLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 7 HKLR 110)</a> which is an interesting example of how these matters were dealt with at the time and to which I shall later return.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 1936 Ordinance provided for standard clauses which were to be deemed to be incorporated into every Ordinance authorising a reclamation,rather like the clauses in the English Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 were deemed to be included in every Act authorising thecompulsory acquisition of land.  The current Ordinance, however, creates a procedure for authorising reclamations without the needfor a special Ordinance each time and contains general provisions about compensation.  Since the construction of the Ordinance isat the heart of this case, I must set out its provisions in some detail.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  By s.2 (the definition section) the term reclamation âincludes any work over and upon any foreshore and sea-bedâ.  Sections3 to 8 then deal with the procedure for obtaining authorisation.  The Director of Lands (âthe Directorâ) must prepare a planâdelineating and describing the proposed reclamation and the foreshore and sea-bed intended to be affected therebyâ (s.3) andpublish notice of it in various newspapers and public places (s.5(1)).  The notice must describe the foreshore and sea-bed affected,describe the manner in which it will be affected (s.5(2)(a)) and state that a person who has âan interest, right or easement inor over the foreshore so describedâ (which I shall compendiously call a âmarine rightâ) may object within a specified period,being at least 2 months: s.6(1).  Marine rights would include private easements or public rights of way giving access to the foreshoreor sea, or simply the right of an owner of land adjoining tidal water or the sea to go to and from the water as a public highway:see <i>Attorney-General of the Straits Settlements v. Wemyss</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2013%20AC%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 13 App Cas 192.</a></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  If there are no objections, the Chief Executive may authorise the reclamation: s.7.  If there are, the matter must go to the ChiefExecutive in Council, which must consider the objections and either decline to authorise the reclamation or authorise it in wholeor in part: s.8.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Sections 9 to 11 then deal with the legal consequences of authorisation.  Notice of authorisation must be published in the sameway as the notice of the proposed reclamation and must state that any person who considers that he has a marine right âthat willbe injuriously affected by the reclamationâ may claim compensation by notice in writing delivered before a specified date, beingnot less than 12 months after publication of the notice: s.9(2)(c).  Upon publication of the notice, all marine rights over the landdesignated for reclamation are extinguished (s.10(1)(a)) and no one has a right to restrain the Government from carrying out thescheme: s.10(1)(b).  Furthermore, âno action shall be brought or continued in respect of the extinguishment [of the marine rights]â:s.10(2).  The sole remedy of anyone injuriously affected is a claim for compensation: s.11.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Section 12 deals with the claim for compensation and I must set out the relevant parts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(1)    Any person who claims that his [marine right] will be injuriously affected by the reclamation may deliver to the Directora written claim stating the sum of money which he is willing to accept in full and final settlement of his claimâ¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)      A claim under subsection (1) shall be made before the expiry of the time specified in the notice served by the Director andpublished under section 9(1) in respect of the reclamationâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  When a claim has been served, the Director has 6 months in which to decide whether to admit or reject it: s.13(1).  If the claimis rejected or the amount of compensation has not been agreed within 7 months of service of the claim, the Director or the claimantmay refer the claim to the Lands Tribunal âto determine in accordance with this Ordinance and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Tribunal Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17">Cap. 17</a>) the amount of compensation to be paidâ.  The jurisdiction of the Lands Tribunal is then to â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âdetermine the amount of compensation payable by the Government to the claimant in respect of any [marine right] injuriously affectedby the reclamation in full and final settlement of the claim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  By <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.15(3)</a>, money payable as compensation bears interest as from the date of the publication of the notice of authorisation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9(1)(b)</a>, but the Government may make a provisional payment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/17/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.14</a> which will <i>pro tanto</i> stop the running of interest.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  So much for the statutory provisions.  The Director of Lands published notice of the proposed reclamation in the Gazette on 5 May1995.  He specified one year as the period within which claims for compensation for injurious affection had to be made.  PBIL lodgedits claim on 3 May 1996, stating that it would accept $2.539 billion in full and final settlement.  Neither side appears to havebeen very energetic in dealing with the claim.  Perhaps, in the period immediately before and after the resumption of the exerciseof Chinese sovereignty, they both preferred to wait and see.  But on 2 November 1999, the Government not yet having accepted theclaim, PBIL referred it to the Lands Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By this time, as I have said, the Government had changed its mind and decided to abandon the container terminal scheme.  By noticedated 10 April 2000 the 1995 reclamation authorisation was revoked and four days later, on 14 April 2000 the new authorisation forthe Disneyland reclamation was published.  It is accepted, however, that the revocation did not revive PBILâs marine rights andthat it had a vested right to compensation by virtue of the 1995 authorisation.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In practice, however, nothing happened at Pennyâs Bay to disturb the shipbuilding business.  Only in March 2001, with the reclamationto build Disneyland imminent, did PBILâs tenant surrender its tenancy.  On 3 April 2001 the company surrendered its lease of Lot22 to the Government.  The Government paid the company $1,506,098,750, of which $22,710,000 was said to be the value of the landwithout marine rights and $1,483,380,000 was said to be a payment <i>ex gratia</i>.  This had been under discussion for some time.  On 1 February 2000 the companyâs surveyor had written to the Director recordingthat the Government was considering acquisition of the lease for an amount equal to its full market value plus professional fees,together with â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAn ex gratia payment on the basis that the Property falls within the areas affected by essential projects with territory-wide significanceand will therefore be regarded as within a Zone A classification.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The same letter recorded what was said to be an agreement that â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[T]he ownerâs compensation under [the Ordinance] arising from [the 1995 authorisation] will be treated as a separate issue. That is to say that any compensation/payment arising from the voluntary surrender of the Property currently under negotiation willnot be taken into account in or prejudice the assessment of the Ownerâs claim under the Ordinance.  That is to say, both issuesare âdelinkedâ one from the other.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Proceedings before the Lands Tribunal took a leisurely course.  There was a dispute about how the compensation should be assessedin the light of the facts that the original authorisation had been revoked and that there had been no actual interference with marineaccess before the company surrendered its lease.  PBILâs view was that subsequent events were irrelevant.  The compensation shouldbe the difference between the value of its land on 5 May 1995 without the reclamation and its value on the assumption that on thatdate the reclamation had taken place.  For some reason, this method of calculation was referred to as a ânotional purchase by referenceto principles of contractâ, although that does not seem to me a particularly illuminating way of describing it.  The Governmentâsview was that the notice of authorisation should be treated as if it had been a tort by which PBILâs marine rights were wrongfullyextinguished on that date.  In accordance with general principles of tort law, damages should be the loss which, at the time of thehearing in the Tribunal, could be proved to have been caused by the notional tort, together with an estimate of any loss which wouldoccur in the future.  In this case, that would mean any loss which was caused by the situation of the ship building business beingprecarious after the authorisation and before the sale, together with the difference in the price for which the lease had been surrenderedand what its value would have been with marine rights. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The Government also had an alternative argument on the assumption that it was wrong about the compensation being for a notionaltort.  If the correct measure was the difference between the value on 5 May 1995 with marine rights and its value after their extinction,the latter valuation should also take into account that the container terminal scheme was expected to bring road connections to PBILâsland which would increase its value, probably more than any diminution caused by the loss of marine rights.  So no compensation wouldbe payable.  PBIL responded that if this method was adopted (or indeed, if the Governmentâs notional tort method was adopted) itsrights under art.105 of the Basic Law not to have its property taken without compensation would be infringed.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  PBIL applied to the Lands Tribunal for an order that these questions of principle should be tried as preliminary issues.  The Tribunalrefused the application and PBIL appealed.  The Court of Appeal said that the Governmentâs position was vacillating and unclear. It ordered pleadings to be served and gave PBIL leave to apply again to the Tribunal for the trial of preliminary issues after theyhad been more clearly defined.  This seems to have been only moderately successful.  On the second application the parties were unableto agree as to what the issues were and so on 8 February 2006 the President of the Tribunal, Mr Justice Lam, ordered the trial offour preliminary issues which he had drafted himself:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)     On a proper construction of [the Ordinance], whether the proper basis for assessing compensation is one based on actual damagessustained by the applicant by reference to principles in tort as at the date of the assessment (as contended by [the Director]) orone based on a notional purchase on the date of the 1995 authorisation of [PBILâs] right that has been extinguished by referenceto principles in contract (as contended by the [PBIL]).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)    If the correct basis is one of contract, whether betterment arising from the scheme relating to the 1995 authorisation canbe taken into account.  In other words, whether the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle has any application in the context of a claim under [the Ordinance].</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)    If the correct interpretation of [the Ordinance] is the one contended by the [Director], whether there is any infringementof art.105 of the Basic Law.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)    If the correct interpretation of [the Ordinance] is the one as contended by [PBIL] and the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle is applicable, whether there is any infringement of art.105 of the Basic Law.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I am not sure that it was a good idea to have these preliminary issues, not only because of the delay which they caused, but becausean understanding of the practical consequences of applying a principle can sometimes demonstrate that it cannot possibly be right. In addition, the language in which the questions were expressed (ânotional purchaseâ, âbettermentâ, â<i>Pointe Gourde</i> principleâ) was calculated to give rise to further problems of construction when they came to be applied to the facts.  With hindsightand some years on, I think it might have been better to start by establishing the facts and then argue over the valuation principleswhich the Ordinance required to be applied to them.  However, the Director did not appeal against the decision to order a preliminaryissue and PBIL, which pressed for the order, is in no position to complain about the consequent delay.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Presidentâs opinion on the first preliminary issue was that compensation ought to be calculated as if PBIL was complainingof the commission of a tortious interference with its marine rights, but that the extinguishment of those rights counted as a tortiousinterference without the need for any physical act of reclamation.  In view of that decision, the Governmentâs alternative caseraised by issue (b) did not arise.  The tortious measure gave full compensation for any loss actually suffered and therefore satisfiedart.105 of the Basic Law.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In the Court of Appeal, Yuen JA agreed with the President and was for dismissing the appeal.  Cheung JA, on the other hand, agreedwith PBILâs submission that compensation was payable for the difference between the value of the land with and without marine rightson 5 May 1995.  What happened afterwards was irrelevant.  Nor was it permissible to take into account any enhancement in value whichmight follow from implementation of the container terminal scheme and its associated road works.  He was therefore for allowing theappeal.  The opinion of Rogers VP contains some valuable insights but his view about what the outcome should be is a little difficultto pin down.  At any rate, he was for allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the Lands Tribunal to make the best it couldof the views expressed in the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In this Court, the appeal was argued with great clarity and economy by Mr Michael Barnes QC (âMr Barnesâ) for the Governmentand Mr Denis Chang SC (âMr Changâ) for PBIL. No one, I think, would claim that s.12 of the Ordinance was well drafted.  First,it does not actually say that there is a right to compensation.  As Lord Cairns said of s.68 of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act1845, it appears to assume that there is a right to compensation and âcontents itself with pointing out the manner in which thatcompensation shall be obtainedâ: see <i>Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281869%29%20LR%204%20HL%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1869) LR 4 HL 171</a>, 217-218.  Obscurity seems to be something of a tradition in land compensation legislation.  Secondly, the section speaks of themarine rights being injuriously affected when in fact they are not so much injuriously affected as extinguished.  It is the ownerâsother land which is injuriously affected by the loss of the marine rights.  Thirdly, it does not say how the compensation shouldbe calculated.  That is left to be gathered from the use of the term âinjurious affectionâ and the scheme of the Ordinance asa whole.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There is no doubt about what âinjurious affectionâ means.  It is an expression which goes back to the Land Clauses ConsolidationAct 1845, if not to the standard clauses in earlier private Acts which the 1845 Act superseded.  It means a diminution in the valueof land caused by works authorised by statute which would otherwise have been tortious: <i>In re Penny and South Eastern Railway Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281857%29%207%20E%20%26%20B%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1857) 7 E &amp; B 660</a>, 669.  Thus the landowner cannot claim compensation for matters such as interference with his view of the sea, which would not havebeen actionable even in the absence of statutory authority.  But he can claim for deprivation of the common law right of access towhich I earlier referred.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In English law, the right to compensation for injurious affection arises only when there is actual interference with the rightsin question.  The fact that a statutory scheme has been authorised, so that the owner is prospectively deprived of a legal rightto complain of the interference, does not entitle him to make any claim before the scheme has been actually implemented and the damagecaused: see <i>Re Poulter</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2020%20QBD%20132" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 20 QBD 132.</a>  When damage does occur, the owner then has the normal limitation period within which to make a claim, as if it had been caused bya tort.  He may then claim for both past and prospective loss, which will be assessed by the Tribunal on the facts as they appearat the time of the hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Mr Barnes urged upon the Court that we should adopt the same method of calculation.  The use of the term âinjurious affectionâshowed an intention, he said, to follow English law.  In my opinion, however, that gets him only part of the way.  It certainly showsthat the claim is for damage which, but for the statute, would be tortious.  But it does not mandate the same method of assessingthe compensation.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  There are certain difficulties about reconciling the English law on this point with the scheme of the Hong Kong statute.  First,unlike the position in England, the claim under s.12 must be made within a period which will usually be (and in this case was) oneyear.  In many cases the reclamation will not have started by that time.  If, therefore, the owner can claim only for actual loss,the period for making a claim will have expired before it can be made.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Mr Barnes said that one could get over that difficulty by treating the statutory extinguishment of rights under s.10(2) as itselfcausing compensatable loss.  It meant that the ownerâs exercise of marine rights was thereafter âprecariousâ and that in itselfmight be reflected in a diminution in the value of the land.  But s.12 provides for a claim by a person whose marine rights âwillbe injuriously affected by the reclamationâ.  As Rogers VP pointed out, the reclamation is the recovery of the land from the sea,not the authorisation or the extinguishment of rights which precedes and permits it.  Mr Barnes said that âreclamationâ was adefined expression which could be given a wide meaning.  It was said to include âany work over and upon any foreshore and sea-bedâ. I do not see how that helps.  When Parliamentary draftsman says that a term shall âincludeâ something, he means that in additionto the term having its ordinary, conventional meaning, it shall be deemed also to cover other things which might not be regardedas coming within that meaning.  Thus âwork upon the foreshoreâ would include buildings and other structures which would normallybe regarded as additional to the reclamation rather than forming part of the reclamation itself.  But the extinguishment of rightsby publication of the authorisation is neither a reclamation in the conventional sense of that word, nor a work upon the foreshore. It cannot therefore be a ground for recovery of compensation under s.12.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Secondly, s.12 requires the owner to state the sum âwhich he is willing to accept in full and final settlement of his claimâ. That suggests that the injurious affection will then be a quantifiable amount.  If the future is uncertain, the owner cannot, asin a personal injury action, ask for the assessment of damages to be adjourned until his condition stabilises.  He must put forwarda figure which, if accepted by the Director, will settle his claim for once and for all.   And if the Director does not accept it,the duty of the Lands Tribunal under s.13(4)(b) is to determine the amount of compensation âpayable â¦ in full and final settlementof the claimâ.  That again suggests that the claim was quantifiable at the time it was made and that the duty of the Tribunal issimply to say what the right figure is.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Thirdly, as Cheung JA pointed out, interest on the entire compensation starts running from the date of the authorisation.  Thattoo suggests that the whole right to compensation accrues on that date.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Thus we have a statute which provides for compensation for injurious affection which will be caused by the reclamation but assumesthat this has accrued and can be fully quantified before the reclamation has taken place â indeed, when it may be uncertain whethera reclamation will take place at all.  In my opinion this can only mean that for the purposes of assessing the compensation, it mustbe assumed that on the date of authorisation it was certain that the reclamation would take place.  This gives effect to the futuretense in s.12: the owner claims that his land âwill beâ injuriously affected, not that it has been or may be so affected.  Thestatute cannot have contemplated that the Government, having given notice that a reclamation was authorised, would be able to invitethe Tribunal to speculate as to whether and, if so, when it might happen and have the compensation discounted accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  What this means in practice is that the reclamation is treated as having taken place on the date of publication of the authorisationand the compensation is the difference between the open market value of land in actual enjoyment of its marine rights and its openmarket value when deprived <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i> of its access to the sea.  Although there was no discussion of the point, that appears to have been the way the question was decidedin the case of <i>In the matter of an Award of Compensation made by His Excellency the Governor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%207%20HKLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 7 HKLR 110</a>, to which I have referred.  In that case, as here, claims for compensation had to be made within a short period from the passingof the Ordinance which authorised the reclamation and it is clear from the judgment that it had not yet taken place when the mattercame before the Chief Justice on appeal against the compensation awarded by the Governor.  The harbour of refuge was âhereafterto be newly createdâ: see p.112.  Nevertheless, the measure of compensation adopted by the Chief Justice was the difference betweenthe rental values of the properties at the time of the passing of the Ordinance and âafter the completion of the proposed reclamationâ:see p.113.  In other words, for valuation purposes, the reclamation was assumed to have taken place.  Of course the question of principlewhich I am now considering was not argued, so the case is not an authority on the point, but it does show that the method of calculationwhich I think is necessarily implied by the structure of the legislation seemed obvious to everyone who was involved.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As the measure of compensation is the difference between the respective values of the land with and without access to the sea on5 May 1995, Cheung JA must be right in saying that nothing which happened after that date can affect the valuation.  The value ofa property means the price which it would have fetched on a sale in the open market between a willing seller and a willing purchaseron the relevant date.  That obviously cannot be affected by what happened afterwards.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  On the other hand, the parties to the hypothetical sale on 5 May 1995 would have had expectations about the future which, whetherright or wrong, would have influenced the price at which they were willing to deal.  The plan for the container terminal had beenpublished in 1994 and, when the scheme had got to the point of authorisation in May 1995, it is possible that the owners of landin rural Lantau entertained lively expectations about how the value of their land would be enhanced by the proposed works.  Sucha view may have been shared by developers in Hong Kong from whom the hypothetical purchaser would be drawn.  Whether such expectationsexisted and the extent, if any, to which they would have affected the open market value of the land is a matter for evidence whenthe valuation comes to be done.  But if they did exist and would, as a matter of reality, have affected the price which the landwould have fetched, they cannot be ignored.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  It is true that the prospect of new uses for the land, and the increased value which that may have generated, would have enteredinto the valuations both with and without access to the sea.  It is however important to bear in mind that such access, while obviouslyvital to sustain the value of the land as a shipyard, may have played little part in its value for uses which would be served bythe anticipated new access by road.  If, therefore, the price which the land would have fetched would have been heavily influencedby the prospect of a new use rather than a continuation of the shipbuilding business, the difference between such value with accessto the sea and without may not have been very substantial.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I emphasise these matters because Mr Chang laid some stress upon the fact that the valuers had agreed that on 5 May 1995 the valueof the land without marine access would have been 10% of its value with such access.  We do not know anything about the assumptionsupon which this valuation was based.  But the huge difference in values suggests the possibility that it was made on the assumptionthat the alternative to ship building was the prospect of the land being confined to permanent agricultural use, without taking intoaccount the expectations which would have been created by the announcement of the container terminal scheme.  If that was the case,then the valuation would not have been in accordance with reality.  The valuations must take into account all the information whichwas public knowledge at the time and (apart from the assumptions about marine rights) not be based on any artificial assumptions.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The matter must therefore go back to the Lands Tribunal for the compensation to be determined in accordance with the opinion ofthis Court.  There was some discussion in the lower courts of whether any liability for compensation calculated on this basis couldbe said already to have been discharged by the <i>ex gratia</i> payment, which, as I understand it, was made to reflect the fact, in the light of the proposals for the development of Lantau, theland was at the time worth much more than its existing use value.  But this is not a matter upon which this Court can express anopinion.  The Lands Tribunalâs jurisdiction under the Ordinance is to determine the amount of the compensation payable, not todetermine whether that liability has been discharged.  This Court on appeal can have no greater jurisdiction.  I would thereforeset aside the order of the Court of Appeal, discharge the declarations made on the preliminary issues and declare that the compensationpayable to the claimant is the difference between (a) the price which Lot 22 would have fetched on a sale in the open market betweena willing seller and a willing buyer on 5 May 1995 on the assumption that it enjoyed access to the sea as it had done up to thatdate and (b) the price which it would have fetched on such a sale on the assumption that access to the sea had been lawfully interruptedby the completion of the proposed reclamation.</p>    <p><b>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ :</b></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  By the unanimous decision of the Court, the appeal is allowed in the terms set out in the concluding paragraph of Lord HoffmannNPJâs judgment.  As the parties were informed at the conclusion of the hearing, costs here and below will be dealt with upon writtensubmissions as to which they should seek procedural directions from the Registrar.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"><span>(Kemal Bokhary)<br />            Permanent Judge</span></td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"><span>(Patrick Chan)<br /></span> Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"><span>(R A V Ribeiro)<br />            Permanent Judge</span></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top"><span>(Henry Litton)<br />            Non-Permanent Judge</span></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top"><span>(Lord Hoffmann)<br />            Non-Permanent Judge</span></td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Michael Barnes, QC and Mr Valentine Yim (instructed by the Department of Justice) for the appellant</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Denis Chang, SC, Mr Johannes Chan, SC and Mr Jeremy S K Chan (instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist) for the respondent </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2010/12.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
