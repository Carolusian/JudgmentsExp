Although one might be forgiven for thinking that in a sale of goods contract the identityof seller and buyer would be readily apparent this is not the case on this occasion.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  It is helpful to begin by providing the background to the dispute which is best done by identifying the various individuals andcompanies that are involved.  This all began in about December 2002 when the very substantial United States retailer J.C. Penneyand Company (âJCPâ) decided to place an order for the making of a large quantity of boys cargo pants, a type of casual clothing,with Merchantex a Bangladesh-based company that is owned by, an Austrian, Mr Stefan Pirker and his wife.  Merchantex in turn owns75% of a company called Uniwear, a clothing manufacturer in Uzbekistan, the remaining 25% being owned by Uzbek interests.  Uniwearowned and operated a clothing factory there which would manufacture JCPâs order.  Sinomast was nominated by JCP to produce thefabric which was to be used for the order.  Sinomast is a very well-established Hong Kong company whose principal is Mr Anthony Ko. It has a longstanding relationship with JCP as a supplier of fabric for JCP clothing.  This is an enviable position to be in giventhe fact that JCP is able to provide very substantial, and therefore potentially lucrative orders, to fabric suppliers as well asclothing manufacturers.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Given its purchasing power JCP is also able to impose its own procedures and terms for doing business with it.  Before a supplieror manufacturer is appointed JCP will carry out its own investigations into the quality and standing of its suppliers to ensure thatthey are in a position to comply with its requirements in terms of the quality of the product, an ability to produce the order ontime, financial probity as well as adherence to strict international standards on labour laws.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff (âEtacolâ), which is also a long established Hong Kong company, is substantially owned and controlled by Mr BernhardFrey (âMr Freyâ), a Swiss national, who is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  His wife Barbara (âMrs Freyâ) is the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff and the Deputy Managing Director of Etacol.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff (âAndreaâ) is the Freyâs, then 14-year old, daughter whose involvement in the action I will come to presently.  Etacolâsbusiness is that of a trim supplier in the garment industry and does most of its business selling to garment companies and retailersin Europe and Asia. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The other main character in this matter is Mr Lisle Budden who is an American.  He is very experienced in the trading of fabricand garments and acts as an agent obtaining orders for garment and fabric manufacturers from substantial retailers such as JCP, forwhich he receives a commission from the manufacturer.  He operates through his own company, Beximco, based in the US.  He has a contractwith Merchantex and Uniwear whereby those companies will pay him a commission as well as a retainer to source orders for them fromsubstantial retailers such as JCP.  Mr Budden is well acquainted with Mr Steve Bohman of JCP, as well as others in JCP, as a resultof which he was able to secure for Merchantex/Uniwear the order that is the subject matter of this action.  He was also known toMr Ko at Sinomast through their, up till now, separate connections with JCP.  Having secured the order for Merchantex/Uniwear, MrBudden was to become the lynch-pin or, at all events, the point of contact between Merchantex/Uniwear [that is to say Mr Pirker andhis manager in Bangladesh Mr Faraz (as I shall call him)] and Sinomast [Mr Ko in Hong Kong].</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Before I go to the detail of JCPâs order, it will be helpful to provide some further background which, in the event, was the causeof the dispute as it now presents itself.  An important aspect which was certainly, in part, to become a cause of future difficultieswas that this was a rushed order by JCP.  It appears that their original supplier had let them down and so they, at short notice,had to look elsewhere and it was in this way that Mr Budden was able to secure the order for Merchantex/Uniwear.  JCP themselvesnominated Sinomast to make the fabric.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The question of payment was all important.  JCP would pay Merchantex/Uniwear for the order, such payment was to include the costof the fabric that Sinomast was to produce.  The banking system in Bangladash where Merchantex is situated and in Uzbekistan whereUniwear is located is not sufficiently advanced or flexible to deal with international letter of credit payments which were to beinvolved in this case.  It is for this reason that Etacol became involved.  Mr Pirker and Mr Frey have had a good working relationshipfor a number of years.  Because Etacol is based in Hong Kong and is in good standing with HSBC it regularly, and indeed as a matterof course, opens letters of credit and can effect payment in that way with its own customers and similarly receive payment for itsown sales. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  This being so Mr Pirker had established an arrangement with Mr Frey that his companies would effect and receive payment using Etacolâsletters of credit.  Etacol would therefore act as Merchantex/Uniwearâs paymaster and/or âbankerâ for which Etacol would bepaid a 3% commission to provide Mr Pirkerâs companies with this service.</p>    <p class="heading">The Payment Arrangements on this Occasion</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  What I am about to describe can be easily followed through the documents and e-mails that are in evidence and to which I will presentlyrefer.  The overall scheme was to be that JCP would pay Merchantex/Uniwear for the order out of which payment the latter would paySinomast for the fabric.  Sinomast, perfectly sensibly it seems to me, required to be paid through a first-class bank either herein Hong Kong or in the USA.  This suited Mr Pirker as well.  An arrangement was therefore put in place, with Mr Buddenâs involvement,whereby JCP would open a letter of credit in favour of Etacol with HSBC in Hong Kong to the value of its order with Merchantex/Uniwearand Etacol would in turn open a smaller letter of credit, also with HSBC in Hong Kong, in favour of Sinomast for the price of thefabric.  The expectation therefore was that once Sinomast shipped the fabric to Uniwear in Uzbekistan it would receive payment underEtacolâs letter of credit and that once Merchantex/Uniwear produced the order and shipped it, Etacol would receive payment on theirbehalf in Hong Kong on the letter of credit that JCP had opened with HSBC in Hong Kong.  Thereafter Etacol would credit Merchantex/Uniwearâsnominated bank account with the proceeds, less the amount paid to Sinomast for the fabric and less its 3% commission on the transactionsand everybody would go away perfectly satisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  That expectation broke down, for reasons which nobody involved had wished for, when the shipment of fabric by Sinomast to Uzbekistanwas held up at the PRC/Uzbek border due to the absence of a health certificate for the fabric.  This caused a delay in getting thefabric to the factory, which in turn delayed production.  The Uniwear factory was required to deliver the order to JCP at the portof Bremerhaven in Germany.  It had anticipated doing so by road and rail.  Even though Mr Budden had been able to negotiate somedelay with JCP the order now had to be air-freighted to Germany at much greater cost causing a loss of US$100,000 to Merchantex/Uniwear.</p>    <p class="heading">The Mechanics of the Dispute</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Had Sinomast received the amount that it had expected under Etacolâs letter of credit for producing the fabric, I do not believethat for one moment anyone at Sinomast would have given a second thought as to whether the contractual buyer of the fabric was Etacolor Merchantex/Uniwear.  Having regard to the delay in receiving the fabric from Sinomast which in turn caused delay in producingthe order, which resulted in Uniwear having to air-freight the order at much greater expense,  Mr Pirker instructed Etacol to onlyrelease, in round figures, US$333,000 to Sinomast under the letter of credit which is US$100,000 less than the agreed selling pricefor the fabric.  Mr Pirker has blamed Sinomastâs freight forwarder in not asking for the proper documentation from Sinomast includingthe health certificate to get the containers carrying the fabric through the PRC/Uzbek border on time.  Mr Ko of Sinomast does notaccept blame for this.  Mr Budden has tried to resolve the problem between the parties by trying to find a mutually acceptable compromisebut he has not been able to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Once payment of the US$100,000 was not forthcoming from either Merchantex/Uniwear or Etacol, Sinomast put the recovery of this amountin the hands of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Informlink Consultancy Limited, which is a debt collection agency, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Mr Jacky Chan being its principal.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs staff then started to demand payment from Etacol, firstly, by writing letters and sending notices, then by sendingmen round to its offices demanding payment followed up by unpleasant telephone calls to Mrs Frey and also by visiting the Freyâshome and frightening both Mrs Frey and Andrea.  This process of harassment by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, for whom Sinomast is vicariously liable, is the subject matter of the second part of the action which I can dispose ofshortly at this stage.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Letters were written to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by Etacol explaining that it owed nothing to Sinomast because it has no contract with Sinomast and that Sinomast wouldhave to look to Merchantex/Uniwear for repayment.  These events occurred during the summer of 2003.  Fortunately, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was persuaded to desist.  In September 2003, at a time when Sinomast was threatening to bring proceedings in court to recoverthe US$100,000 from Etacol, Mr Frey instructed his solicitors to bring this action.  Etacol therefore got in first.  The first partof it is for a declaration by Etacol to the effect that it has no contract with Sinomast for the purchase of the fabric and is thereforenot indebted to it for the US$100,000.  This declaration is opposed by Sinomast which counterclaims against Etacol for this amountâ hence the issue that I am required to resolve.  Separately, the Freyâs are also suing the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants for damages for harassment.  In this respect they have also sued Sinomast for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants unlawful activities on the basis of it being vicariously liable for what the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants have done.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The three relevant plaintiffs have settled their harassment claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants and so I am not concerned with the case against these two Defendants.  As against Sinomast, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs took out an Order 14 summons claiming summary judgment on their claim for harassment.  On this summons, they obtainedjudgment, with damages to be assessed, from me on 15<sup>th</sup> September 2006.  In the course of the trial, I have also heard evidence from Mr and Mrs Frey in respect of quantum on this part ofthe case which I propose to consider after I have dealt with the main issue on whether Etacol can be held to be liable to Sinomaston the sale of the fabric.  This therefore is how the matter now lies before me.</p>    <p class="heading">The Law on the Contractual Issues</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Lee Tung Ming, on behalf of Sinomast, in a series of very persuasive submissions has suggested that there are two bases uponwhich Etacol can be held liable to pay Sinomast for the outstanding balance of US$100,000.  Firstly, as the other contracting partyon the contract of sale for the fabric.  If that fails, then Etacol is still to be held liable for the outstanding balance as Merchantex/Uniwearâsagent by incurring a concurrent personal liability under the contract for the sale of fabric.  I will need to consider each basisseparately, although the second would only require an answer if Sinomast fails to make out its case under the first.</p>    <p class="heading">Etacol as the Buyer</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The outcome of the question of whether two parties have arrived at a binding contract is to be decided by looking at the matterobjectively.  The starting point is to ask whether an offer had been made by one party and accepted by the other.  The current editionof <i>Chitty</i> at 2-001 in addressing the objective test says that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ once the parties have to all the outward appearances agreed in the same terms on the subject matter, then neither can, generallyrely on some unexpressed qualification or reservation to show that he had not in fact agreed to the terms to which he had appearedto agreed.  Such subjective reservations of one party therefore do not prevent the formation of a contract.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>at 2-002 (<i>ibid.</i>) the offer is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the personmaking it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed.  Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intentionto be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror (A) may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable personto believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Fundamentally, this is a question of fact to be decided on all of the relevant evidence.  A very important part of the evidenceis the letter of credit and some of the other documentation which names Etacol as the buyer.  Whilst, on the face of it, this mustprovide strong ammunition for saying that Etacol is the buyer of the fabric, it is by no means conclusive.  In this regard Mr Hung,who appears for all the Plaintiffs, relies on the decision of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Shanghai Tongji Science &amp; Technology Industrial Co. Ltd v Casil Clearing Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20HKLRD%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 HKLRD 548</a>, which involved the use of a letter of credit.  Whilst the facts substantially differ from what I am required to consider the judgmentof Ribeiro PJ re-states the principles that I have to apply in coming to a conclusion as to whether Etacol is the buyer of the fabric. In that case, where there had been a lot of dishonourable conduct which is not the case here, it might be said that the significanceof the letter of credit was to be more easily discounted.  It had been contended that the fact that the terms of the letter of creditcalled for an invoice to be issued in the name of the Defendant (Casil Clearing Ltd), in the present case Etacol, showed that <i>Casil</i> was a party to the contract.  Notwithstanding this Ribeiro PJ held that to be:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ unobjectionable and reasonably explicable as an aspect of financing arrangements.</i>â (at p.567A (<i>ibid.</i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In this regard the learned Permanent Judge referred to the judgment of Potter LJ (as he then was) in <i>Montrod Ltd v Grundkotter Fleischvertriebs-Gmbh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20WLR%201975" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 WLR 1975</a> at 1992, who in relation to documentary credit transactions commented that there are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ a âwide variety of circumstances in which documents come into existence in a commercial context which do not necessarily reflectthe factual situation but which parties may none the less employ as a convenient means of progressing a particular transaction.â</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  <i>Shanghai Tongji (supra.)</i> also provides a re-statement of the principle that a decision as to whether a binding contract has been concluded requires the applicationof an objective test.  At page 561C-D Ribeiro PJ made clear that the burden of establishing the existence of a contract by virtueof the parties conduct is on the person asserting its existence â in this case Sinomast.  Reference was made to <i>Brogden v Metropolitan Railway</i> (1877) 2 App 666 at 693.  The court will not imply such a contract lightly: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>The conduct relied on must be unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred.</i>â  (at p.561D (<i>ibid.</i>)). </p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>The Aramis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 1 Lloyds, Rep 213</a> at 224, Bingham LJ (as he then was) in a passage referred to in <i>Tongji</i> at 561E said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>I do not think it is enough for the party seeking the implication of a contract to obtain âit mightâ as an answer to [the above-mentioned]questions, for it would, in my view, be contrary to principle to countenance the implication of a contract from conduct if the conductrelied upon is no more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract.  It must, surely, be necessaryto identify conduct referable to the contract contended for or, at the very least, conduct inconsistent with there being no contractmade between the parties to the effect contended for.

Lord Phillips of Worth Matraversâspeech at page 1466 explained the position in relation to the objective test to be applied and the impact of any subjective qualificationto it.  He said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>A contract will not be concluded unless the parties are agreed as to its material terms.  There must be âconsensus ad idemâ. Whether the parties have reached agreement on the terms is not determined by evidence of the subjective intention of each party. It is, in large measure, determined by making an objective appraisal of the exchanges between the parties.  If an offeree understandsan offer in accordance with its natural meaning and accepts it, the offeror cannot be heard to say that he intended the words ofhis offer to have a different meaning.  The contract stands according to the natural meaning of the words used.  There is one importantexception to this principle.  If the offeree knows that the offeror does not intend the terms of the offer to be those that the naturalmeaning of the words would suggest, he cannot, by purporting to accept the offer, bind the offeror to a contract: Hartog v Colin&amp; Shields  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%203%20All%20ER%20566" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1939] 3 All ER 566</a>; Smith v Hughes  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281871%29%20LR%206%20QB%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1871) LR 6 QB 597.</a>  Thus the task of ascertaining whether the parties have reached agreement as to the terms of a contract can involve quite a complexamalgam of the objective and the subjective and involve the application of a principle that bears close comparison with the doctrineof estoppel.  Normally, however, the task involves no more than an objective analysis of the words used by the parties.  The objectof the exercise is to determine what each party intended, or must be deemed to have intended.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Finally, in relation to the applicable test as to when a contract will be deemed to have been concluded, Ribeiro PJ at 564H-J (<i>ibid.</i>) drew attention to the current edition of <i>Chitty</i> at 2-148 which really encapsulates the position, if I may say so, very succinctly:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ the objective test is â¦ subject to the limitation that it does not apply in favour of a party who knows the truth.  Thus â¦the party who did not intend to be bound would not be bound if his state of mind was actually known to the other party.  Nor coulda party who did not in fact intend to be bound invoke the objective test so as to hold the other party to the contract: to applythat test in such a case would pervert its purpose, which is to protect a party who has relied on the objective appearance of consentfrom the prejudice which he would suffer if the other party could escape liability on the ground that he had no real intention tobe bound.</i>â (at p.156 Â§ 2-148)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I will need to apply these principles in deciding whether a binding contract has come into existence between Sinomast and Etacol. If Mr Lee succeeds in persuading me that it has then it will not be necessary to go on and decide his fall-back position which seeksto argue liability on the basis that Etacol was Merchantex/Uniwearâs agent but also one which has incurred personal liability underthe contract.  The law in relation to when an agent will incur such liability can be briefly explained and I propose to do that afterI have set out and analysed the relevant evidence.  Hopefully, that analysis will provide the context and background against whichMr Lee seeks to make out Etacolâs alternative liability and therefore will make his points more readily understandable.</p>    <p class="heading">The Material Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The outcome must turn on the contemporaneous e-mails and the terms of the proforma invoices and the letters of credit and otherârawâ documentary evidence that was generated at the time, as well as the evidence of the various witnesses who have spoken tothese events and their understanding of what was going on at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By way of preliminary comment I wish to say, having read the documentary evidence and heard these witnesses, that what I have todo is to embark on an <i>ex-post facto</i> reconstruction to decide who the contracting parties were when I am absolutely convinced that at the time that this was going onno one gave a second thought about the contractual status, as between themselves, of the three involved entities, they being Sinomast,Etacol and Merchantex/Uniwear (who for the moment I will continue to refer compendiously) and this comment also extends to Mr Buddenâsthoughts on the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I am satisfied that JCP considered that it had a contract with Merchantex/Uniwear to produce the order for which it would make paymentat the appropriate time and for his part I also have no doubt that this was Mr Pirkerâs understanding so far as Merchantex/Uniwearwere concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Under that contract JCP had nominated Sinomast to make and supply the fabric.  As nominated supplier Sinomast had no contractualrelationship with JCP and quite rightly nobody has suggested otherwise.  This requirement by JCP was one that the manufacturer ofthe order, Merchantex/Uniwear, would have to comply with.  But for the difficulties with the banking systems in Bangladesh and Uzbekistan,I have absolutely no doubt at all that one would have seen documentation in the form of an order for the fabric going from Merchantex/Uniwear(it would have been from one or the other as they are quite distinct companies with different shareholders as Mr Lee correctly pointsout) to Sinomast and thereafter an invoice going the other way.  If payment was to be, as is usual, by letter of credit that wouldhave been opened by one or other of Mr Pirkerâs companies and payment would have been released to Sinomast after delivery of thefabric against the usual documentation.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Pausing here for a moment; because Mr Pirker could not pay Sinomast in that way he was obliged to interpose Etacol to effect paymenton his behalf.  Indeed he accepts, and I was pleased to have his assurance about this in the course of his evidence, that if Etacolis obliged by me to pay Sinomast the US$100,000, he considers himself duty and legally bound to indemnify Etacol for this amount. Given the history of dealing between Mr Frey and Mr Pirker, whereby Etacol made such payments for the Pirker companies using itsown letter of credit facilities, I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Frey had never considered himself as entering into direct contractualrelations with Mr Pirkerâs customers in relation to the letters of credit that were used to finance those transactions.  On thisoccasion as well, I am satisfied beyond any doubt whatsoever that he did not consider that Etacol was contracting with Sinomast asbuyer of this fabric.  This of course was his subjective understanding but I am required to stand back from all of the evidence andconsider this matter objectively as the authorities require me to.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Equally, for his part Mr Ko says that he would never have allowed his company to enter into a direct contractual relationship withunknown, to him, companies in Bangladesh and Uzbekistan, a country whose international borders he could not identify on a blank mapof the world.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  With all of such situations the principal, if not the only, concern for a supplier such as Sinomast is that it should have in placea financing arrangement which will ensure that it will receive payment against the presentation of the usual shipping documents. Hence Mr Koâs insistence, quite rightly, that he would be paid through a first class bank in either the USA or Hong Kong, whichis what he ultimately obtained through the interposition of Etacol.  It is this sort of analysis which needs to be accommodated inany objective appraisal of the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In his very detailed analysis of the documents, Mr Lee has stressed that much of the correspondence between Mr Budden, JCP, Merchantex/Uniwearand Etacol was not copied to Sinomast.  Had it been it would have demonstrated to Mr Ko what the real underlying position was inrelation to Etacol and its role as paymaster/banker, with the result that Sinomast would not, in my judgment, have had any sort ofcase against Etacol.  But in view of the fact that Mr Ko and his staff were not privy to that earlier correspondence the issue must,and does remain very much afloat.  Those early e-mails only serve to demonstrate that so far as Messrs Pirker, Frey and Budden, Etacolâsrole was strictly limited to opening the letter of credit.  This is the basis of my finding that Mr Frey was convinced of his verylimited role in this matter and that his company was in no sense the buyer of the fabric.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Quite rightly, Mr Lee has stressed the importance of the documentation which, if unexplained or put into context as Mr Hung hassought to do, would tell the uninformed neutral observer that this was a contract between Sinomast and Etacol for the supply of thisfabric.  Mr Hung has helpfully extracted from the document files, the main correspondence and documents which he has put into a folderof  âcore documentsâ which contains the essential but not all the material upon which the outcome of this case depends.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  What is perfectly plain is that all the documentation between a buyer and a seller on an international sale financed by a letterof credit is present identifying Etacol as buyer and Sinomast as seller.  How this came about can be told shortly.  Originally, theJCP documentation had identified Uniwear as the other contracting party but once it became clear that payment could not be directlyeffected by it to Sinomastâs satisfaction JCP had to assign the name of Etacol in its place otherwise JCPâs own system of accountingcould not accommodate a situation which had Etacol receiving payment from JCP on the letter of credit.  For this reason, Etacol wasassigned its own computer identification number as JCPâs contracting party.  Everything had to revolve around JCPâs way of doingbusiness.  Everybody concerned was prepared to fall in with its requirements in order to, in Merchantex/Uniwearâs case, becomean approved and listed supplier, now and in future, and in the case of Sinomast to continue with what was already a good workingrelationship.  In Sinomastâs case this went even further because there had been a misunderstanding with JCP who opened a letterof credit with HSBC in a form that was not acceptable to HSBC so another had to be put in place.  This caused a delay before JCPopened another letter of credit in acceptable form.  During this time the fabric needed to be shipped by Sinomast as a matter ofgreat urgency.  Mr Ko was prevailed upon by Mr Budden to ship the fabric before payment was received.  Mr Ko anxious not to upsethis relationship with JCP was prepared to do this.  He considered that as this was a JCP related matter he ought, as a matter ofgood business sense and accommodation, to do so.  This perhaps is the most significant instance of these smaller commercial organizations,anxious to please a larger and more powerful customer, being prepared to take a chance, which Mr Ko did in letting the fabric gobefore the letter of credit had even been opened.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Having regard to the bare evidence which has the effect, if not otherwise explained, that there was indeed a contract between Etacoland Sinomast, Mr Hung submits that none of this is at all surprising.  This is precisely the documentation and state of affairs thatone would expect and indeed require to see under such a letter of credit.  In describing the status of a letter of credit he hasdrawn my attention to Professor Goodeâs text on <i>Commercial Law</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, page 987 which states the position of a letter of credit in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>One of the primary functions of the letter of credit is to create an abstract payment obligation independent of and detached fromthe underlying contract of sale between Seller and Buyer and from the contract between the Buyer and Issuing Bank.  It is thus acardinal rule of documentary credits that the conditions of the bankâs duty to pay are to be found exclusively.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In assessing this matter one must also be aware of the exchange of the later e-mails in which Sinomast were in communication withMerchantex/Uniwear from which it was absolutely clear that Uniwear was going to manufacture the JCP order.  It was abundantly cleartherefore that this was not just a simple sale of fabric â it was a contract for the production of the fabric which Sinomast wasrequired to ship to the manufacturer.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Whilst Mr Lee has embarked on a very detailed analysis of every small step on the way between Sinomast having obtained the orderto produce the fabric until its receipt of an amount that was US$100,000 less than the agreed value of the fabric, such an exercisewhilst valuable in the sense of being comprehensive must not be allowed to get in the way of a view of the overall objective picture. It seems to me that anybody viewing this objectively cannot avoid the conclusion that, quite frankly, Mr Koâs only pre-occupationwas to have in place a financing arrangement which was going to ensure that he was paid promptly in an effective manner, hence hisrequirement that it be in Hong Kong or the US.  What mattered to him was that he had received yet another order from JCP whose customhe greatly valued, to the extent that in order to please it he was prepared to let the fabric go even before the letter of credithad been opened.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I do not wish to be understood as being unkind to Mr Leeâs very hard worked and elaborate analysis of the documents but it seemsto me that no amount of argument slanted to support a view that a contract of buyer and seller existed between Etacol and Sinomastfor this fabric can survive the reality of the situation which is that Sinomast was selling this fabric to Merchantex/Uniwear andthat Etacol was merely there as agent for Mr Pirkerâs companies to effect payment for the fabric to Sinomast.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Lee has rightly asked the rhetorical question: if it was not Etacol who was the buyer, which of Merchastex or Uniwear was thebuyer of the fabric?  That is a perfectly proper observation because of course it could not be both.  In my judgment, the answermust be Uniwear, the manufacturer â it being Uniwear that was originally on the JCP documentation.  It was only when it was realisedthat Etacol would be the paymaster for Uniwear that Uniwearâs name was replaced with Etacolâs on the JCP computerised system. The substance of it, on any reasonable objective view, was that JCP had placed its order with Uniwear to manufacture the order andit required Uniwear to buy the fabric from Sinomast and to pay Sinomast for that fabric which it did through Etacolâs agency bymaking use of Etacolâs letter of credit facility in Hong Kong.  Any other way of viewing these facts is to distort the contractualreality.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  This explains the status of the letter of credit.  The fact that the documentation attaching to the letter of credit names Etacolas buyer merely reflects the demands of the system of finance by letter of credit.  It goes no further than that on these facts forwhich ample support is to be had from the case of <i>Tongji</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the English cases to which I have already referred, as well as Professor Goodeâs textbook, the passage which I have recitedat paragraph 33 above demonstrating the separate obligations created by the letter of credit itself and the underlying contract ofsale between buyer and seller.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  This being my view, Sinomast has failed to show that it had a contract for the sale of the fabric with Etacol and so as a matterof primary obligation it is not able to make Etacol liable on the price of fabric and <i>a fortiorari</i> for the disputed shortfall of US$100,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Agency</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  This then leaves over Mr Leeâs fall-back position which requires me to consider whether Etacol should be held liable on a concurrentbasis as agent.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Lee submits that just because Etacol may have acted as agent for Uniwear will not necessarily negate its liability for the purchaseprice.  Etacol can only do so if it can show that on agency principles it has expressly or impliedly negatived its personal liability. This is to be decided by looking at the intention of the parties to be deduced from the nature and terms of the contract and allthe relevant circumstances when viewed objectively.  The starting point and general postition is stated at<br />    9-001 in <i>Reynolds</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>In the absence of other indications, when an agent makes a contract, purporting to act solely on behalf of a disclosed principal,whether named or unnamed, he is not liable to the third party on it.  Nor can he sue the third party on it.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Nevertheless, that is not the end of the matter.  The principle, as correctly submitted by Mr Lee, appears in 9-002 of <i>Reynolds</i> citing Lord Scarman in <i>Yeung Kai Yung v Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 787</a> at 795:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>However, the mere fact that a person acts as agent and is known to do so does not necessarily negate his involvement in the transaction. It has more recently been said that âit is not the case that, if a principal is liable, his agent cannot be.  The true principleof law is that a person is liable for his engagements (as for his torts) even though he acts for another, unless he can show thatby the law of agency he is to be held to have expressly or impliedly negatived his personal liability.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Leeâs point is that the evidence does not sufficiently disclose that Etacol was merely acting as agent for Uniwear or indeedanybody else.  He goes further than that by saying that even if he cannot support that submission, the fact that Etacol had a foreignprincipal in Uzbekistan would be a very powerful consideration in deciding whether Etacol can be said to have negatived its personalliability.  Sinomast would not have countenanced a situation whereby it would contract through an agent with a far-off party whoseagent would be absolved of any personal liability on the contract.  The position is discussed at 9-20 in <i>Reynolds</i> and reference is made there to <i>Teheran-Europe Co. Ltd v Belton (Tractors) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%202%20QB%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 2 QB 545</a> which sets out the modern law on the subject.  This passage bears repetition here:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b><i>Foreign principal.</i></b><i>  There long existed a strong presumption of fact (so 9-020 strong that a court was âjustified in treating it as a matter of lawâ)that in the context of sale where an agent in England contracted on behalf of a foreign principal, disclosed or undisclosed, theagent assumed personal liability to his English suppliers and had no authority to pledge the principalâs credit by establishingprivity of contract between the principal and the third party; and conversely, where a merchant in England contracted with an agentabroad, that merchant was not to be regarded as having authority to bring his suppliers into privity of contract with the Englandmerchant. â¦</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â¦ The presumption could be displaced by clear evidence of authority.  Further the effect of the presumption was to render the agentalong liable and entitled on the contract; so that when it was clear that the agent contracted only as agent, and that it was notintended that he should be personally liable, there was no room for the presumption, which could not operate inconsistently withthe clear purport of the contract.  The presumption was not affected by the fact that the contract was in writing: most, if not all,of the cases concern such contracts.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>The status of this presumption was discussed in many cases, and though it could be questioned, it was said to reflect both a preferenceby foreign merchants to use an intermediary who did not bring them into privity of contract with a merchant in another country, especiallywhere the contract involved bulk supplies from several foreign sources; and also the reluctance of English merchants to enter intotransactions which might involve them in problems of the conflict of laws or the possibility of having to sue in a foreign jurisdiction,or both, especially where the contract concerned bulk supplies from overseas sources.  The latter reasoning seems more significantto modern eyes, since the foreign merchantâs contract with his English intermediary may not be governed by English law.  The bankerâscommercial credit system performs a similar function in to some extent localising the transaction.  Later cases tended to treat thefact that the principal was foreign as one to be taken into account but no more.  In Teheran-Europe Co. Ltd v S.T. Belton (Tractors)Ltd, where air compressors were ordered for use in Iran, the Court of Appeal held that the presumption itself no longer exists, forâthe usages of the law merchant are not immutable.â But the fact that the principal is foreign is not irrelevant.  Diplock LJsaid:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âThe fact that the principal is a foreigner is one of the circumstances to be taken into account in determining whether or not theother party to the contract was willing, or led âthe agent to believeâ that he was willing, to treat as a party to the contractthe agentâs principal, and, if he was so willing, whether the mutual intention  of the other party and the agent was that the agentshould be personally entitled to sue and liable to be sued on the contract as well as his principal.  But it is only one of manycircumstances, and as respects the creation of privity of contract between the other party and the principal its weight may be minimal,particularly in a case such as the present where the terms of payment are cash before delivery and no credit is extended by the otherparty to the principal.  It may have considerably more weight in determining whether the mutual intention of the other party andthe agent was that the agent should be personally liable to be sued as well as the principal, particularly if credit has been extendedby the other party.ââ</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It seems to me that the facts in this case and my ruling on the main issue go a long way in determining this question as well. The evidence has demonstrated that Etacol had a very limited role indeed.  Although it was an agent, it was only an agent in arrangingpayment to suit Sinomastâs wish to be paid in either Hong Kong or the US through a reliable bank by letter of credit.  Etacol didnot play the part of an agent as Mr Budden had of putting buyer and seller together, which is the usual situation that one is requiredto deal with in deciding whether an agent has also assumed personal liability.  Once one understands Etacolâs very limited role,as I have already found it to be, that must dispose of this issue as well.  There is simply no basis for saying that Etacol had,by accepting this very limited role, also assumed a concurrent liability under this contract for the sale of fabric by Sinomast toUniwear.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  This being my view, Sinomast must therefore be taken to have failed on this basis as well.  Accordingly, Etacol must have the declarationthat it seeks and Sinomastâs counterclaim will therefore stand dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum for Harassment</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  This of course is a quite separate aspect of the case.  Mr Hung accepts that the amount of damages awarded will be modest.  I havebeen shown cases where the behaviour complained of was very much worse than this â a bad example of which is the decision of ChuJ in <i>Sheck v Wong &amp; Ors</i>, HCA 4455/2002 where she felt able to award $300,000 under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Although there is no doubt that in the present case this was very disturbing behaviour which upset Barbara Frey in particular whichwould have included her worries as a mother for her children especially when the behaviour complained of started when Mr Frey wasnot in Hong Kong and she could not look to him for support.  It ought to be remembered that there was no violence, although fromthe Plaintiffâs point of view this must have been something that was seen as a real risk.  What is clear is that matters did notget seriously out of hand and the debt-collection agency was called off and desisted in reasonably short order.  Mr Hung acceptsthat the most that he can reasonably ask for is $80,000.  The behaviour complained of amounted to âheavy tacticsâ by the debt-collectorsâ abusive language, a visit to the vicinity of the Freyâs house which was all calculated to frighten the Freysâ into payingup.  In my judgment the proper award is one of $45,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Where the Plaintiffs have succeeded they must have their costs of the action.
