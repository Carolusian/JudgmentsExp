First, the parties have given and adduced evidence on various events, which gave riseto a number of factual disputes.  Some factual disputes are either irrelevant to the central issues or of peripheral significanceonly.  For present purposes, I will not dwell on those matters, although I have already considered all the evidence with care beforearriving at my determination on the central issues.  Second, as will be seen in a moment, it is common ground that Leeling, as theprogram manager, was responsible for the daily administration of SPS.  The defendant gave evidence on Leelingâs conduct on certainimportant events.  But she had not called Leeling to corroborate her evidence.  There is no explanation as to why the defendant didnot do so.  That being the case, I will approach what the defendant has said about Leeling with extra caution.  Third, both Mr Ngand Mr Kwan have made lengthy submissions.  I have carefully considered all their submissions although I will not discuss every singlepoint taken by them in this judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I now turn to the central issues on liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">II.

They may be briefly stated as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> First, the words complained of in a libel action are to be construed in their natural and ordinary meaning, i.e. in which reasonablepeople of ordinary intelligence, with the ordinary personâs general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likelyto understood them.  The question is what would the words convey to the mind of the ordinary, reasonable, fair-minded reader?  See<i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, 10<sup>th</sup> Edn, para. 3.15 at pp. 92 and 93.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Second, the ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be implied or inferred or an indirectmeaning; any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond the general knowledge but is a meaning whichis capable of being detected in the language used can be part of the ordinary and natural meaning.  The ordinary and natural meaningmay therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader guided not by any special bout only by general knowledge,and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction would draw from the Words : <i>Jones v.

First, the plaintiffs had failed to discharge their function as governors of theBoard to perform conciliation but led mass resignations instead.  Second, they had laid many wrongful accusations against the defendantas chairperson.  Although the word âwrongfulâ was not used in Paragraph 6 to describe the accusations laid against the defendant,when Paragraph 6 is read together with Paragraph 7 where âconstant rumours and slandersâ and Paragraph 8 where âmalicious slandersâwere used, the accusations referred to therein must mean wrongful accusations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In Paragraph 7, two imputations also arose.

With respect,I disagree.  The sting of the 1<sup>st</sup> Imputation is that the conduct of the plaintiffs, who had failed to discharge their functions as governors in such circumstances,is either irresponsible or dishonourable.  This is plainly defamatory : see <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.19 at p. 50.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Imputations in essence say that the plaintiffs were libellers, slanders and scandalmongers.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Imputations then respectively state the consequences of the plaintiffâs wrongful conduct of spreading rumours, wrongful accusationsand malicious slanders :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">it threatened the coherence of SPS and the quality of its service; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">it adversely affected the defendantâs health.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">These imputations are plainly defamatory : see <i>Gatley</i>, para. 2.19 at p. 49.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Kwan conceded that the 5<sup>th</sup> Imputation is defamatory.

Recruiting police volunteers</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In about April or May 2004, a proposal was made to recruit police volunteers.  On 3 May 2004, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, the defendant, Leeling and another staff member met with representatives of the police.  Shortly before the meeting, therewas a short discussion between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the defendant in which he raised his concerns.  It is the defendantâs case that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was concerned that the police volunteers would hijack SPS and that they joined SPS for enhancing their promotion prospect. The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs case is that he welcomed the police recruits but he was concerned about the training method.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> I will return to this aspect when I come to the question of malice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">C. Differences over the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The response from the police volunteers was good.  For the first time, about a group of 40 police recruits would join the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session, which was to commence on 24 June 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Various members of the TC and BSC disagreed with the staff as to how to conduct the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session.  I need not dwell on details.  In gist, the staff proposed a segregated training for police and non-police recruits. Some members favoured a joint training.  At the joint meeting held by the TC and BSC on 16 June 2004 (âthe Joint Meetingâ),attended by eight members including the plaintiffs, it was unanimously agreed that the police and non-police recruits were to betrained together at one venue.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> It is the undisputed evidence of the plaintiffs that after the Joint Meeting, on 17 June 2004, Ming conveyed the proposals of theJoint Meeting to Leeling and asked her to implement them for the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session but she refused.  The staff then issued a notice stating, among other things, that the proposals reached at theJoint Meeting had aroused comments and from individual volunteers.  It then set out a so-called âWin Win Situationâ proposalmade by the staff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The plaintiffs and some other members of the TC held a further meeting with the staff including Leeling on 19 June 2004.  The staffinsisted on having the separate training.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> On 23 June 2004, the Preparatory Meeting was held.  It is the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs evidence that the staff told the trainers that the separate training would be adopted and that the mode of separatetraining was approved by both the TC and BSC.  She was very upset by the staffâs lie.  She together with Alice and Wong immediatelytold the meeting that that was not the case.  Alice and Wong also said that they were very disappointed and told the meeting thatthey had already resigned from the BSC<a>[12]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Betty also attended the Preparatory Meeting.  Her evidence is that the Meeting was very chaotic.  Different members had differentviews and the views of the TC did not necessarily represent all the members.  The staff said that different members had differentviews over the training method and that TC though that the best way was to have a joint training.  Betty recalled that when she cameinto the meeting she heard that a member was reading out his/her resignation and her attention was focused on the resignation.  Underre-examination, she said the Resignation Declaration (which was dated 24 June 2004) was read out at the Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> On balance, I prefer the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs evidence to Bettyâs.  If what Betty said were correct, then the staff was just reporting the differences to the trainers. That would not have so upset the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, Alice and Wong and, as will be seen later, prompted the plaintiffs to resign from the TC.  Further, I am unable to acceptBettyâs evidence, which only came about in re-examination, that the Resignation Declaration was read out at the Preparatory Meeting<a>[13]</a>.  I think Betty had probably confused the Resignation Declaration with what Alice and Wong said about their resignations at the Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> For completeness, I will deal with a point raised by the evidence of the defendant, James and Betty, which is this.  They all saidin their witness statements that members of SPS had different views on the mode of training for the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session and the rejection of the plaintiffsâ proposal came not only from the staff but also those members involved inthe 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session, which on the evidence before me must mean members of the TC and BSC.  And it is the defendantâs case that the1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had failed to refer the disputes between members over the training method to her as chairperson under the SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> for determination.  His failure was given by Leeling at the Announcement Meeting (held on 28 August 2004) as one of the reasons whythe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs membership was terminated.  However, even on their own evidence, the only member of the TC and BSC who might have differentviews on the training method was Horace.  Under cross-examination, both the defendant and James said that only Horace had differentviews.  (But it should be noted that at the Review Meeting, Horace said that he agreed with the decision of the Joint Meeting <i>albeit</i> with some reluctance.)  Betty said that members of TC and BSC did not have different views over the training method.  In any event,there is no evidence to suggest that the difference between Horace and other members of TC and BSC, if any, warranted a referenceto the defendant as chairperson for determination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Accordingly, I reject the evidence of the defendant, Betty and James that the plaintiffsâ proposal on the training method for the36<sup>th</sup> Training Session was rejected not only by the staff but also by SPS members as alleged.  It follows that the purported reason forterminating the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs membership on the ground that he had failed to refer to the defendant the alleged differences between members overthe 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session cannot possibly stand.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D. The resignations</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> It is the plaintiffsâ evidence that the staffâs conduct had invariably caused a breakdown of working relationship of the committeemembers and the staff.  What followed was a series of resignations of the members.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> On 17 June 2004, shortly after he had met with Leeling who refused to carry out the proposals of the Joint Meeting, Ming resignedfrom all the positions he held in SPS including that in the BSC.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> On 19 June 2004, Alice and Wong resigned from the BSC.  In her witness statement, after referring to the staffâs refusal to carryout the proposals of the Joint Meeting, Alice had this to say :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">ã</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">7.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">æ¬äººæ¸æ¥å°ç¥éèªå·±æ¯ç±æ¼ä¸­å¿çè·å¡(è¬çç²å°å§)æ¡åçä¸åä½åä¸æ­£ç¶çè¡çºï¼å èæå°æ²ååå¤±æãå¨æ­¤äºä»¶å¾ï¼æè¦ºå¾åçä¸ä¾ä¹ç¡æ³çºå§å¡æçå©çå±¥è¡èªå·±çç¾©åï¼æä»¥ææ¼2004å¹´6æ19æ¥æ±ºå®è¾­è·ï¼æçè¾­è·æ¯èªé¡åéåå°å©ä½ååæå¶ä»äººçå½±é¿èä½åºçâ¦â¦ã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> It is the plaintiffsâ evidence that after the Preparatory Meeting, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff called him and told him what had happened.  She said she also wanted to resign.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff said he would call other members of TC and informed them of what the staff had done at the Preparatory Meeting.  On 24June 2004, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff told the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff that he and other members of TC (Joe and Cynthia) would also resign.  He asked if a resignation declaration should be issued. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff agreed and asked him to issue one for all others.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff then issued the Resignation Declaration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Thus as at 24 June 2004, all the three members of the BSC and four out of the six members of the TC had resigned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Despite their resignations, all the resigning members except Ming continued to take part in the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session.  In particular, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was responsible for team leading in seven out of the nine sessions of the preparatory course and had acted in the capacityas a trainer to train all team members in two out of the seven sessions.  In the end, the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session was successfully completed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The defendant has not adduced any evidence that is capable of contradicting the plaintiffsâ evidence on the resignations as summarizedabove.  But she said the plaintiffs âleadingâ the resignations referred not to the date of the resignations but their power toinfluence others.  This is a new allegation which arose during her oral testimony.  In any event, it has no substance at all.  Forthe evidence clearly shows that the resigning members made up their mind on their own.  They were not influenced by the plaintiffsas alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> I accept the plaintiffsâ evidence and find that they and other members of the TC and BSC resigned because of the breakdown of theworking relationship between the members and the staff and that they had not led the mass resignation as alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Mr Kwan sought to rely on two matters to support the defendantâs case that the plaintiffs led mass resignations.  He first reliedon Bettyâs evidence that the Resignation Declaration was read out at the Preparatory Meeting.  This I have already rejected<a>[14]</a>.  He next submitted that the decision of some resigning members to resign before the plaintiffsâ had to be considered against thebackground that the plaintiffs were members of the Board and were looked upon as leaders amongst volunteers.  Alice said she askedthe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to announce the resignations because he was senior.  And the Resignation Declaration was issued in the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs name.  In my view, even accepting that the plaintiffs were respected because of their position and seniority in SPS,it is not evidence that capable of proving directly or otherwise that they had led mass resignations as alleged.  I can see no substancein Mr Kwanâs submission at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">E. When the defendant became aware of the resignations</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The parties hotly disputed as to when the defendant came to know about the resignations and read the Resignation Declaration.  Theplaintiffsâ case is that the defendant was made aware of the resignations on 24 June 2004.  The defendantâs case is that sheonly became aware of the same on 19 July 2004 when she returned to Hong Kong from leave.  Their evidence is summarized below.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> On 24 June 2004 at 15:06, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff emailed a copy of the Resignation Declaration to Leeling, copied to the defendant (âthe 24/6/04 Emailâ).  The 24/6/04Email was sent to the defendantâs email address at SPS (âthe Chairperson Addressâ) and EPD (âthe EPD Addressâ).  Aftersending the email, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff called the defendant at her direct line and had a conversation with her.  What the parties had said is in dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff said that he informed the defendant about the resignations of the committee members and told her that he had already emailedher the Resignation Declaration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The defendant said that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff told her that he had sent an email to her and asked if she had read it.  She said she did not have time as she was busyat work/meetings.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had not told her about training problems but just asked her to read the email when she was free.  The telephone conversationwas very short as she was in a hurry to a meeting.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff did not tell her what the email was about or that it was urgent.  As she was talking to the plaintiff, she glanced at thecomputer screen but did not notice any pop-up suggesting the existence of incoming mail.  She then left her office for the meetingand did not go back that day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The defendant further explained that the Chairperson Address could only be assessed at the SPS office in Tung Tau Estate.  She hadnever sent or received emails via that Address.  However, SPSâs staff had established an autolink so that emails to the ChairpersonAddress would be re-directed to the EPD Address.  Sometimes, there were problems with the autolink.  Further, she could only reademails sent to the EPD Address at her office.  But there were occasions where the emails to the EPD Address were not received instantaneouslybecause of delay in the network system from the EPD headquarters to her regional office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The defendant went on to say that later that evening, Leeing called her and informed her that the agenda for the coming AGM was resolvedand ready to be issued.  When the defendant inquired about the 24/6/04 Email, Leeling said that it was about training and everythingwas under control and the training would start that evening.  The defendant was given the impression that all was well and runningsmoothly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Separately, it is the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs evidence that on 24 June 2004, when she called the defendant to discuss about the agenda for the AGM, she took theopportunity to tell the defendant about the resignations.  The defendant said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff discussed with her about the agenda only.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Between 25 June and 18 July 2004, the defendant went on leave.  It is her evidence that for most of that period, she was not in HongKong and could not read emails.  She put aside all matters concerning SPS.  When she returned from leave on 19 July, she discoveredthere had been disputes and mass resignations on 24 June 2004.  It was only then that she read the 24/6/04 Email.  (At the AnnouncementMeeting, the defendant said that she was not aware of the events until Patrick, a volunteer, called her after her return from leave.) After she found out the truth, she scolded Leeling for lying to her on 24 June 2004.  Leeling then said that she could deal withthe matter as she had persuaded volunteers to carry out the training.  According to the defendant, Leeling was covering up ratherthan outright lying.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> I have carefully considered the evidence.  On balance, I accept the plaintiffsâ evidence that they told the defendant about theresignations at the telephone conversation they each had with the defendant on 24 June 2004.  In light of the importance of the resignations,it is only reasonable for them to do so.  On the other hand, I am unable to accept the defendantâs evidence for a number of reasons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> First, the resignations of the committee members, including the plaintiffs who were dedicated and experienced volunteers, at theeve of the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session, were plainly an acutely important matter.  James even said in evidence that it was unprecedented in SPSâs history. If not properly addressed, the repercussions and damage to SPS would be very serious indeed.  The defendant as chairperson shouldbe informed of the same forthwith.  It is simply incredible for Leeling, a senior staff member of SPS responsible for its daily administration,to have lied to the defendant or covered up the matter when she asked about the 24/6/04 Email on 24 June 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Second, when Leeling received the 24/6/04 Email in the afternoon, she was fully aware of the fact that it had already been copiedto the defendant.  Once the defendant read the Email herself, she would find out what had actually happened.  Any lie or coveringup by Leeling could be easily exposed.  Would she lie to the defendant or cover up the matter in such circumstances?  I think probablynot.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Third, the defendantâs allegation that she had not read the 24/6/04 Email until she returned from leave on 19 July 2004 does notsit well with other emails exchange between 27 and 30 June 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> It is the undisputed evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff that on 27 June 2004 at 23:57, she sent to the defendant an email (âthe 27/6/04 Emailâ) attaching the amended minutesof the 4<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting at the Chairperson Address.  On 28 June 2004, an email purportedly sent by the defendant from the email address âAdministration(SPS)â (âthe Administration Addressâ) attaching the revised minutes addressed to Leeling was sent to members of the Board includingthe plaintiffs (âthe 28/6/04 Emailâ).  By the 28/6/04 Email, Leeling was asked to send the minutes to members of the meeting. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff said after receiving the 28/6/04 Email, she responded by sending an email on 30 June 2004 (âthe 30/6/04 Emailâ) tothe defendant at the Chairperson Address.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The defendant said that the 27/6/04 Email was sent to the Chairperson Address which would have been directed to the EPD Address. But as she was on leave, she could not read the 27/6/04 Email or the minutes attached at the time.  She further said that had notsent out the 28/6/04 Email.  The Email was sent out from the Administration Address.  According to her understanding, one neededthe password to have access to the computer located at the SPS Centre in Tung Tau Estate and she did not have the password.  Shedid not go to the SPS office during her leave and she had never used the SPS computer.  Thus it seemed that somebody else had usedher name to send it out.  In any event, the amendments to the minutes could not have made by her as she was not familiar with typingChinese words and her practice was to make hand written version and then send them by fax to SPS for passing on to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.  Looking at the amendments, the defendant thought that they were made by somebody familiar with the shifts and dutiesof the volunteers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> As to the 30/6/04 Email, the defendant said that after she came back from leave, there were lots of emails.  She only read the minutesattached but did not pay attention to the emails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> On the evidence before me, I fail to see why anyone would have in the name of the defendant revised the draft minutes prepared bythe 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, sent out the 28/6/04 Email and directed Leeling to forward the revised minutes to members as if he/she were the chairpersonof SPS.  Further, such conduct is highly improper and disturbing.  But no action whatsoever had been done to follow it up.  Thatis simply incredible.  I reject the defendantâs evidence that she had not read the 27/6/04 Email and that she had not sent outthe 28/6/04 Email.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In my view, the 27/6/04 Email and the 28/6/04 Email demonstrate beyond doubt that the defendant had access to her email address,be it the Chairperson Address or the EPD Address, on 27 and 28 June 2004 and that she had utilised her email address at the time. By that time, the 24/6/04 Email (attaching the Resignation Declaration) must have already arrived at both Addresses.  And the defendantmust have read the 24/6/04 Email by then (even assuming that she did not do so on 24 June 2004).  In other words, the allegationthat she only read the 24/6/04 Email and learnt about the resignations on 19 July 2004 is, in light of the 27/6/04 Email and the28/6/04 Email, demonstrably false.  This is why the defendant had to and did lie about those Emails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Fourth, the defendantâs case does not sit well with subsequent email exchanges between her and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in July and August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff recorded in an email dated 6 July 2004 (âthe 6/7/04 Emailâ) that he had informed the defendant about the resignationsby telephone on 24 June 2004.  In her email reply dated 23 July 2004, the defendant made no denial about this point.  Under cross-examination,the defendant said that she did not directly deny this point in her email.  But the truth is, there was no simply no denial at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff made another record about the telephone conversation on 24 June 2004 in another email dated 4 August 2004 (âthe 4/8/04Email (P1)â).  To this email, the defendant made no reply at all.  The defendant explained that when responding to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs emails, she would tackle the problems that seemed to her to be most important, that is, the resignations, rather thanarguing point by point on every single issue.  Further, at the Announcement Meeting, she did say that she became aware of the resignationsonly on 19 July 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> In my view, it was apparent from the 6/7/04 Email and 4/8/04 Email (P1), the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was concerned about the defendantâs lack of response since 24 June 2004 when he told her about the resignations.  Itis only reasonable for the defendant to refute him if he had not told her about the resignations on 24 June 2004 as alleged.  Further,her explanation that she would tackle with problems that appeared to be most important is inconsistent with her another email dated31 July 2004 and sent out by Leeling on her behalf on 2 August 2004 (âthe 31/7/04 Emailâ) where she refuted the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff over, among other things, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs allegation as to the tone used by the two of them at a telephone conversation on 28 July 2004, which does not seemto be an important matter.  (I will return to those matters in Section F below.)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Finally, as to what she said at the Announcement Meeting on this point, I am of the view that it was simply self-serving.  I willnot attach any weight to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Mr Kwan sought to rely on Pearlâs Statement to support the defendantâs case that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff did not tell her about the resignations on 24 June 2004.  Pearl said that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had on 24 June 2004 asked her to send a declaration to other trainers, which she agreed without asking for details.  Shethought it was only a routine matter.  But when she received the Resignation Declaration that evening, she realized what it was. So she did not send it to other trainers.  By email dated 25 June 2004, she told the defendant what had happened.  Mr Kwan submittedthat Pearlâs email may be indicative of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs tendency to seek to allege he had said something which he never said, as in the case of his informing the defendantof the mass resignations in the telephone conversation on 24 June 2004.  Mr Kwan proceeded on the assumption that what Pearl statedin her email was true.  However, Pearl has not come to court to testify.  The veracity of her version of the event has not been testedunder cross-examination.  I will not attach any weight to Pearlâs evidence.  On the other hand, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff said that when he called Pearl, he had already told her that it was the Resignation Declaration.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was not shaken under cross-examination.  I accept his evidence.  Accordingly, I reject Mr Kwanâs submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> For these reasons, I find that the defendant had received the 24/6/04 Email on 24 June 2004; that the plaintiffs had told her aboutthe resignations on 24 June 2004; that she was fully aware of the resignations by then and not until 19 July 2004 as alleged; andthat she had read the 24/6/04 Email either on 24, 27 or 28 June 2004 and not 19 July 2004 as alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">F. Calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting and the ensuing disputes</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> Pursuant to Rule 29 of SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, the secretary may call a board meeting upon the requisition of not less than one-third of all the members of the Board.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff said that after 24 June 2004, he had called the defendantâs office and left message asking her to deal with the resignations. But he received no reply.  He therefore sent the defendant the 6/7/04 Email.  On about 8 July 2004, he discussed with other governorsincluding the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and they decided to call an urgent Board meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> As noted above, on 23 July 2004, the defendant sent an email to reply to the 6/7/04 Email.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff said that on 28 July 2004, she called the defendant three times but could not reach her.  She left a message with her secretary. The defendant did not return her call.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff then proceeded under Rule 29 of SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and at 15:15 on 28 July 2004, sent an email to the Board members to call the 4/8/04 Board Meeting (âthe Notice for the 4/8/04 Meetingâ). The agenda covered two items : (1) the resignations of the members of the TC and BSC; and (2) the resignation of Anna who was theãå©çç¨åºç­åä¸»ä»»ã. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff accepted under cross-examination that the Notice for the 4/8/04 Urgent Meeting was issued before there was any discussionor consultation with the defendant as to the date, the venue and the contents of the agenda.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> At 15:55 on 28 July 2004, the defendant sent an email to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff copied to the Board members, stating that she already had a commitment on 4 August 2004 and suggesting that the urgentboard meeting be held on 7 August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> The defendant then called the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff at about 16:00 on 28 July 2004.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff said that the defendant insisted that the calling of the urgent Board meeting without her prior approval was disrespectfulto her and the defendant was agitated.  The defendant denied that she was agitated.  She said she was just trying to discuss withthe 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff who cut her short by giving an excuse that she had an appointment with a doctor and hung up on the defendant in the midstof her enquiry.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> On 29 July 2004, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff wrote an email to the defendant responding to her email dated 28 July 2004.  Separately, two of the board members who hadrequisitioned the urgent board meeting had indicated by email dated 28 and 31 July 2004 that another date would be agreeable to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> It is the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs evidence that on 31 July 2004 she made three telephone calls to the defendant at her direct line but there was no answer. She also called her office number.  The handset was lifted but there was no sound and then the telephone was hung up.  The defendantâsevidence is that 31 July 2004 was a Saturday.  Both she and her secretary were on leave.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> On 31 July 2004, the defendant then issued the Clarification Letter to all Board members, members of the TC and BSC and the staff. There she stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ãå¦ä½ æ¥ç²çäºæç¥æ¸æè© é¯å¥³å£«ä¹ç¥æææ¸é¢éç¥ï¼æéå¥¹ç¨çå½ç±ç·ç¬¬ä¸å±çäºæåç¾©éè«ä½ æ¼2004å¹´8æ4æ¥æä¸ä¸æåå¸­ä¹æè­°ãæ¬äººå¨æ­¤æ¾æ¸ï¼è©²æè­°å°æªç¶ç¢ºèªä»¥æ­¤å½¢å¼ãè­°ç¨ï¼åæ¥æé²è¡ãã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">She then suggested the resignations of the members of the TC and BSC could be discussed at the Board meeting right after the AGM on7 August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> On 1 August 2004, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff sent an email to the defendant, referring to the telephone calls she made to the defendant on 31 July 2004 and the messageshe left with her asking her to chair the urgent board meeting.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff also asked the defendant if she was not available on 4 August 2004, then when she would be available before 7 August 2004. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff said she needed to contact concerned members of TC and BSC once the date was confirmed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> By another email dated 2 August 2004 at 02:35, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff informed the defendant that a Board member would be available on 3 August 2004 (first choice) and 5 August 2004 (secondchoice).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> On 2 August 2004 at 13:22, the defendant sent an email (dated 31 July 2004) to Leeling and asked her to forward the 31/7/04 Emailattached to the Board members for her.  In the 31/7/04 Email, the defendant dealt with the calling of the 4/8/04 Meeting, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs email dated 29 July 2004 and the telephone conversation between the two of them on 28 July 2004.  Leeling followedthe direction accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> At 17:17 on the same day, the defendant sent out another email to Leeling and asked her to send it out to all Board members.  Therethe defendant replied to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs email of the same date.  She said 7 August 2004 was her preferred date.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> On 4 August 2004, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff sent out an email at 02:15, responding to the 31/7/04 Email and the Clarification Letter which she received by mail (âthe1<sup>st</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2)â).  She pointed out that the calling of the 4/8/04 Meeting was legal pursuant to Rules 29 of SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  As to the reasons for calling the 4/8/04 Meeting, she referred to a letter she wrote to the defendant attached to the email (âtheLetterâ).  The Letter basically set out the plaintiffsâ attempts to contact the defendant and the email exchange between theparties, which I have summarised above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff sent the 4/8/04 Email (P1) at 09:24 on 4 August 2004 to support the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.  He said that matters about the resignations should be sorted out in advance ofthe AGM where queries about the resignations would most likely be raised.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> The defendant said Leeling was very concerned about the plaintiffâs decision to forge ahead with the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.  Shetherefore asked Leeling to forward the Clarification Letter again in case some members had not received it.  Leeling then issuedthe Urgent Appeal attaching the Clarification Letter at 12:15 on 4/8/04, urging members of SPS not to attend the 4/8/04 Meeting. The more salient parts of the Urgent Appeal are set out thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ãè´ï¼åä½çå½ç±ç·æå¡åè·å¡</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ç±ï¼ä¸»å¸­åç¾©æ</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ç·æ¥å¼ç±²</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">é æ¥çäºææå¡ææ­£åçä¹é»éµï¼ç¥æä»èç¥æ¸æè© é¯å¥³å£«æ¼ä»æ(2004å¹´8æ4æ¥)å¬éçå½ç±ç·åæå¡åè·å¡åä¸­å¿å¬éç·æ¥çäºæï¼è¨è«æéãçåæåå§å¡æãå§å¡åãè¨ç·´å§å¡æãé¨åå§å¡ä¹è¾­è·äºå®ãæ¬äººå¨æ­¤å¼ç±²çå½ç±ç·åæå¡æ¬èæè­·æåä¾é»èä¹ç²¾ç¥ãåå¿åèæ­¤æè­°ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">åå å¦ä¸ï¼</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">æ¬äººå·²æ¼2004å¹´7æ31æ¥å»ä¿¡â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦æ¬äººæä»¥ä¸»å¸­èº«ä»½å¨8æ7æ¥AGMå¾ä¸»æãçåæåå§å¡æãå§å¡åãè¨ç·´å§å¡æãè¾­è·äºå®ä¹è¨è«ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">æ¬æä¿çä¸åæ³å¾è¿½ç©¶æ¬å©ãã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> As it turned out, the Urgent Appeal, which specifically reserved SPSâs legal rights, was highly controversial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff responded by sending an email at 13:48 on 4 August 2004 (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2)â), querying why the defendant had to issue the Urgent Appeal to all members of SPS and stating that the UrgentAppealãå°ä¸­å¿é½æ¯ä¸åå·å®³ã.  The defendant did not respond to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> At the AGM held on 7 August 2004, questions were raised about the Urgent Appeal.  One member made this comment about the Urgent Appeal:ãå¶å¯¦æå°ç¬¬äºå¥èªªè©±å¥½åèæï¼ãä¿çä¸åæ³å¾è¿½ç©¶æ¬å©ãï¼æèªå·±çå°å°±å¥½å¿çã.  Leeling saidthat she drafted the Urgent Appeal for the defendant and that the reservation of rights referred to fire safety as the venue forthe intended urgent meeting was too small to accommodate all who would be coming to the meeting.  At the Review Meeting, both Leelingand the defendant explained thatãå¬æä¸è¬é½ä¿åå¯«ã.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> The following points emerge from the evidence relating to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> First, it was entirely legitimate for the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as secretary to call the 4/8/04 Board Meeting under Rule 29 of SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Second, the whole purpose of the Clarification Letter, read objectively, is to stop the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.  In her witness statement,the defendant said that she issued the Clarification Letter âin order to avoid confusion about the meeting date.â  I am unableto accept this allegation.  There is no confusion about the date.  Unless and until it was changed, it would be held on 31 July 2004. The defendant also said that the agenda had a problem because the second item, which related to the resignation of Anna, shouldnot be discussed by the Board in the presence of the resigning members of the TC and BSC.  This the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff agreed under cross-examination.  But plainly, the thrust of the Clarification Letter, read objectively, is to tell therecipients that the calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting had not been approved (æªç¶ç¢ºèª) and that they were asked to attend theboard meeting after the AGM on 7 August 2004 instead.  Indeed, the defendantâs own evidence that when Leeling was concerned thatthe plaintiffs just forged ahead with the 4/8/04 Board Meeting, she asked Leeling to reissue the Clarification Letter, clearly indicatesthe defendant herself intended to use it to dissuade governors from attending the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> In my view, the defendantâs evidence on the date and agenda of the Clarification Letter is a mere afterthought made up to refutethe plaintiffsâ case that she wanted to stop the 4/8/04 Board Meeting from taking place as intended by the plaintiff because sheregarded the calling of that Board Meeting as being disrespectful to her and that she was offended by the plaintiffsâ persistencein go ahead with it as scheduled.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Third, I find that contrary to the defendant evidence, the Urgent Appeal was issued with her prior knowledge and approval.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> As noted, the defendant said in her witness statement that Leeling issued the Urgent Appeal attaching the Clarification Letter. That is all what she had said about the Urgent Appeal in her witness statement.  However, under cross-examination, she said for thefirst time that the Urgent Appeal was not authored by her and that it was sent out without her prior approval and knowledge.  Leelinghad not even discussed the contents of the Urgent Appeal before sending it out.  The defendant first came to know about the UrgentAppeal only when she came back from a meeting on that day.  She did not understand the contents.  So she questioned Leeling aboutit.  Leeling said she wanted to use the defendantâs name in order to give the Urgent Appeal more weight.  The defendant asked Leelingwhat she meant by reserving all legal rights.  Leeling said as she had worked in other centers before, safety was a paramount concernand that she anticipated many concerned volunteers might come to the SPS centre which was not big enough to accommodate them.  Thedefendant said she anticipated that volunteers might be concerned about what âreserving all legal rightsâ mean and Leeling shouldexplain the reason should they query about it.  As to why she did not respond to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2), the defendant said it was up to Leeling to undo what she had done.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> The defendantâs allegation that the Urgent Appeal was issued without her prior knowledge or approval does not withstand a momentof closer scrutiny :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">While Leeling did say at the AGM that she drafted the Urgent Appeal for the defendant and she said at the Announcement Meeting thatãæç·æ¥å¼ç±²ã,it incredible for her to have issued the Urgent Appeal purportedly for the defendant without her prior knowledge and approval.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It defies common sense that the defendant would have taken no step whatsoever to inform the members including the plaintiffs whetherby email or at the AGM, the Review Meeting or the Announcement Meeting that the Urgent Appeal was sent without her prior knowledgeor approval, when it had caused much controversy among the members.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It also defies common sense for the defendant not to respond to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2) but to leave the matter to Leeling for explanation, when any inaction on her part would most likely cause misunderstandingand unnecessarily tense her relationship with the plaintiffs further.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The first sentence of the Urgent Appeal expressly referred to the receipt of an email from the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, which in the circumstance must mean the 4/8/04 Email (P1).

Whenfurther pressed, the defendant said that Leeling would check all the emails sent to the chairperson.  This must be wrong in lightof the fact that the 4/8/04 Email (P1) was sent to the EPD Address and not the Chairperson Address.  There is simply no suggestionthat Leeling had access to the EPD Address.  The defendant was obviously making it up as she went along.  Her evidence is also inconsistentwith what took place at the Review Meeting.  Leeling said that the defendant gave her the information in the 1<sup>st</sup> sentence of the Urgent Appeal.

She even resorted to the reservation of legal rights.  Her and Leelingâs explanation as to why legal rights had to be reservedis simply absurd.  The intention of that paragraph is clear : SPS reserved all legal rights in connection with the 4/8/04 Board Meetingincluding those it might have against the plaintiffs who persisted in holding the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.  In my view, the defendantand Leeling made up such a bad excuse at the time because they wanted to alleviate the damage done by the reservation.  The defendantmaintained it at the trial because she wanted to play down the effect of the reservation, which underlined her firm determinationand intention at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> By issuing the Urgent Appeal to all members of SPS, the defendant had caused the dispute between her and the plaintiffs over thecalling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting to spill over to the membersâ arena at large.  On the evidence before me, this is clearly unnecessaryand unwarranted.  I can see no justification at all.  For completeness, I wish to say this.  Although no reliance has been placedon it to justify the action of sending the Urgent Appeal to all members of SPS, the first sentence of the Urgent Appeal did say thatthe plaintiffs had sent notice to all members of SPS asking them to attend the urgent board meeting.  That is wrong because theyhad only sent notice to the governors of the Board, those committee members of the TC and BSC who were involved in the 36<sup>th</sup> Training Session and the staff only.  Under cross-examination, the defendant first said she came to know about the mistake for thefirst time when she was being cross-examined about it.  But as early as 20 August 2004, at the Announcement Meeting, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had already pointed out the mistake to her and she acknowledged that it was a misunderstanding.  She next said that thewordsãåæå¡ãreferred to Board members only.  But this clearly flies in the face of the sentence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> I have no doubt that the defendant wanted to dissociate herself as much as possible from the Urgent Appeal because it clearly showsthat she was determined and doing her best to prevent it from proceeding, which lends support to the plaintiffsâ case that shewas offended by the calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting.  And having given poor and incredible evidence, she has failed miserablyin such attempt.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> For the above reasons, I find that although the calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting was entirely legitimate even without her priorapproval or knowledge, the defendant regarded it as being disrespectful to her and that she was offended by it and the plaintiffsâpersistence to proceed with the 4/8/04 Board Meeting despite her stated desire to hold the urgent board meeting after the AGM on7 August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">G.

However, as will be seen in a moment, DavidâsEmail should be more conveniently considered together with the dismissal of the plaintiffs.  I will therefore jump to the AGM heldon 7 August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> It is the defendantâs case that shortly before the AGM, some gossip emails were circulating among the members.  The emails producedas evidence in support of her case are emails between an anonymous member and Woodas.  That member raised various matters againstdifferent members, including abuse of power and their intention of joining the coming election at the AGM.  Woodas made a brief response. It is important to note that the matters mentioned by that member are not substantiated by any evidence before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> It is also the defendantâs case that shortly before the AGM, she knew that the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff had sent out a letter with chronology which is highly critical of her.  But she was not aware of the contents by then. She did not recall having come across the letter and thought that she might have missed reading it when she was inundated with emailsat the time.  Horace told her roughly about the contents.  On 12 August 2004, Leeling forwarded to her the 1<sup>st</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2) with the Letter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> The defendantâs evidence on this point is supportable by the fact that her email address did not appear as one of the recipientsin the 1<sup>st</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2).  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff explained that when she sent the 1<sup>st</sup> 4/8/04 Email (P2), she was replying to Leelingâs email sent out from the Administration Address on 2 August 2004 attaching the31/7/04 Email.  She was not aware that the defendantâs email address was not included as one of the recipientsâ.  I note thatthis explanation only emerged in her oral testimony.  But I find it reasonable and accept it.  I fail to see any reason why the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff had to deliberately send the Letter to others behind the defendantâs back.  I will return to the Letter when I come tothe Announcement Meeting where the defendant sought to deal with the contents of the Letter in detail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> In her witness statement, the defendant said that she knew that the plaintiffs wanted to kick her out of SPS.  Even though what theyhad said about her in the Letter that they had circulated was untrue, she did not want to quarrel with them.  She wanted to makepeace with them, particularly when she had planned to resign after finding a suitable replacement.  If the plaintiffs brought herdown, the conflicts in SPS would escalate.  For the sake of preventing further chaos in SPS, she decided to clam things down.  Thusat the AGM, she apologized to the plaintiffs.  She said :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ãâ¦â¦æä¿åå¾åä¿æç¡åç¡ç¾åååå¾åè¶³å¤ æ¢ï¼é½å¸æä½ å°åå®¹åè«è§£ï¼ååå°¤å¶æ¯ä¿æºéæ¹é¢ï¼æç¥éå¯è½æå¥½å¤èª¤æï¼ä»¤å°æåå¯ä»¥å³æåç­å¢çemailï¼æèé»è©±ï¼ä»¤å°ä½ ä¸ä¾¿ï¼æé½å¸æä½ è«è§£â¦â¦ã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> On the evidence before me, there is no evidence to support the defendantâs allegation that the plaintiffs wanted to kick her outof SPS.

One of the matters discussed was the post of director.  It is common ground that the post of directorhad been left vacant since Nancy left in June 2004.  According to the minutes of the AGM, it was resolved :ãæéç¸½ç£ä¹äºå®åç±çäºæåè¨å¾æ¼æå¡å¤§æä¸­ééããTheparties disagreed on what this resolution meant exactly.

The Review Meeting and the 7/8/04 Board Meeting</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> After the AGM, many members stayed behind to discuss matters relating to the resignations, the problems of communication, and theway forward to prevent future problems from recurring.  At one stage, she said : âlet bygones be bygones.â  The defendantâsevidence is that âcauses of the problems were identified, and a working group to sort out details of the issues and work out guidelineswas established.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> Mr Kwan submitted that when the conflicts seemed resolved and members were hoping to move on harmoniously, the plaintiffs suddenlyraised their discontent about communication again and query about the content of the Urgent Appeal.  This, counsel submitted, showsthat they still harboured grudges against the defendant.  With respect, I disagree.  Having looked at the transcript of the ReviewMeeting carefully, I think it was fair for the plaintiffs to raise those matters in the course of reviewing the problems includingthose relating to Urgent Appeal.  It cannot be said that their conduct shows that they harboured grudges against the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> The 7/8/04 Board Meeting was held after the Review Meeting.

Regrettably, that was not the case.  The matter tooka sharp turn, which resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiffs from SPS at the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> I would preface the discussion of the evidence pertaining to the plaintiffsâ dismissal by one observation.  I am not concernedwith the correctness of the decision to dismiss the plaintiffs.  I need to deal with such evidence because it is important for tworeasons : (a) they shed considerable light on the defendantâs credibility; and (b) the defendantâs conduct is relevant to thequestion of malice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> On the dismissal of the plaintiffs, the defendant had this to say in her witness statement after referring to the receipt of the1<sup>st</sup> 4/8/04 Email together with the Letter on 12 August 2004 :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">63.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">I was concerned about the flutter of criticisms, rumours, gossips, slanders among volunteers that habitually circulated in SPS, andit became particularly acute just before the 7 August 2004 AGM.

It no longer lies in her mouth to say that the plaintiffs were involved in the alleged power struggles.  Mr Kwan, however, submittedthat the defendant had an honest belief that they were so involved at the time.  Whether or not she had such honest belief relatesto the question of malice.

The defendantâs case is that the discussion at the AGM was only about the existence of the post and notwhether to fill it.  I have looked at the relevant transcript of the AGM, which is not conclusive.  In gist, the defendant askedfor views about the post of director.  Discussions then followed.  And the defendant concluded by saying that the post of directoris mentioned in various parts of SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and that amending the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> need to be further considered.  She suggested that the matter be discussed by the Board and then any proposal would be decided atAGM.  It seems that the transcript lends support to the defendantâs version.  However, it is also a fact that the AGM did not decideto fill the post of the director there and then.  In my view, the difference of the partiesâ case does not really matter.  Whatdoes is the fact that as at 7 August 2004 there was no urgency in appointing the director.  Indeed, the defendant accepted undercross-examination that no one ever said at the AGM that it was urgent to fill the post of director.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> However, what was not made known to the members at the AGM on 7 August 2004 is that David had already agreed on 3 August 2004 tobe appointed as director.  On 3 August 2004, the defendant called David, who was then in San Francisco, USA.  David returned hercall.  They then discussed about the situation at SPS.  In his oral testimony, David said that the defendant put forward the proposalthat he assumed the position of director and released the duty of those causing trouble.  He said he would consider.  After the telephoneconversation, Davidâs Email was sent to the defendant at 21:52.  The relevant part read :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">âUpon serious reconsideration, I would agree to be acting-Director of SPS and expel those who are causing trouble.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">If necessary, I will confront them in person.  However, I will need plenty of evidence on hand so that I can be fully prepared.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Although he did not name any persons in Davidâs Email as the trouble makers, David said he had the plaintiffs in mind.  Thus asat 3 August 2004, David had, upon the defendantâs suggestion, agreed to act as director to dismiss the plaintiffs from SPS.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Significantly, the defendant made no reference to Davidâs Email at all in her witness statement.  She explained under cross-examinationthat it was because Davidâs Email was not relevant or was relatively relevant only.  This must be wrong.  Davidâs Email is undoubtedlyhighly relevant.  It tends to undermine her case she only played a very reluctant role in dismissing the plaintiffs.  (I will comeback to this part of her case in a moment.)  In my view, there is another reason why the defendant chose to distance herself fromDavidâs Email.  In paragraph 68 of her witness statement, the defendant said David agreed to act as director on 19 August 2004. Davidâs Email contradicts her evidence on two aspects : (a) the date on which David first agreed to act as director was 3 andnot 19 August 2004; and (b) David agreed to expel the plaintiffs as early as on 3 and not 19 August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> As noted, there was apparently no urgency to fill the post of director after the AGM on 7 August 2004.  Then what was the justificationfor appointing David on 20 August 2004?  Under cross-examination, the defendant said for the first time in these proceedings thatthere was chaos after the AGM and she need a director to resolve the chaos.  She said she received a call from a senior police officercalled Charlie Cheung on or before 18 or 19 August 2004 that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff called him and told him that âpolice joining SPS was to hijack or control SPS and for promotionâ.  The defendant saidCheung did not tell her when the alleged conversation took place.  She further said she mentioned the alleged conversation with Cheungat the 20/4/04 Board Meeting.  I have no doubt that this new allegation is a recent fabrication which she made up as she went alongto justify the haste appointment of David.  For completeness, I also note that in her re-examination, the defendant referred to whatLeeling said at the Announcement Meeting.  What Leeling said, however, does not assist her a bit.  For Leeling said the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff called the responsible officer of the police volunteers raising his concerns about the police volunteers taking over SPSin mid July 2004.  This is not evidence that the plaintiffs had caused chaos between 7 and 20 August 2004 as alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the main purpose of appointing David is to expel the plaintiffs.  This is borne outby Davidâs evidence on the defendant approaching him on 3 August 2004 and Davidâs Email.  Further evidence in support is thatDavid was apparently not the best choice for director.  For it is not in dispute that he was mainly responsible for fund raising. He did not attend board meetings regularly or take part in the daily administration of SPS.  Upon his appointment, Leeling had tobe appointed deputy director to assist him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> In his evidence, David said that he, some other board members and the plaintiff had a discussion about the situation of SPS on orabout 17 August 2004.  They had even explored the possibility of resolving SPS.  That may well be true.  But I do not think it hasany bearing on the central issues before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> I now come to the notice calling the 20/8/04 Board Meeting (âthe Notice of the 20/8/04 Board Meetingâ).  It was issued by Jamesas secretary.  And the defendant was aware of the contents before it was sent out.  It only contained two items on the agenda :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">1.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Problems on the Development of Volunteers.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">2.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">A.O.B.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It mentioned nothing about Davidâs appointment or termination of the plaintiffsâ membership.  These items gave the impressionthat the 20/8/04 Board Meeting would discuss some general and unspecific matters which no particular significance at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Some of the Board members, including the plaintiffs, did not attend the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> On any view, the Notice for the 20/8/04 Board Meeting is misleading.  This David readily accepted in his oral testimony.  Initially,the defendant maintained that it was not misleading.  She said they wanted to have an open discussion about the matter to see ifother alternative existed.  This is simply incredible.  Finally, she had to and did admit that with hindsight the Notice was misleading.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> However, the defendant tried to justify the decision of not informing the plaintiffs about the actual business to be transacted atthe 20/8/04 Board Meeting by resorting to : (a) it was not necessary to inform the plaintiffs about the decision to dismiss themunder SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>; and (b) the alleged practice of Samaritans to expel members without informing them.  This is again in my view something that shemade up as she went along.  On any view, it was only fair to give the plaintiffs the right to be heard at the 20/8/04 Meeting.  Inthe end, she accepted with hindsight that it would be fair to inform the plaintiffs of the actual business of the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> In my view, the way in which the Notice of the 20/8/04 Board Meeting was drafted was deliberate.  It wanted to mislead the recipientsas to the true purpose of the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.  In the event that the plaintiffs chose not to appear, they could be expelledforthwith in their absence.  And the defendant was fully aware of it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> I digress to make one observation.  The way David dealt with the dismissal of the plaintiffs was, with respect, less than satisfactory. He was presented with the emails exchange between the parties by the defendant.  He was briefed by the defendant on the situationof SPS, which must also include her disputes with the plaintiffs.  He had however not heard from the plaintiffs.  One would reasonablyexpect him to discuss with them about the matter before dismissing them.  That he had done.  David accepted that the Notice of the20/8/04 Board Meeting was misleading in that it did not state that termination of the plaintiffsâ membership would be discussed. He also accepted that it would be unfair to the plaintiffs if they were dismissed without given an opportunity to be heard.  Heeven expected them to have been informed of the proposal to appoint him as director and to dismiss them from SPS.  He expected themto come to the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.  As it turned out, the plaintiffs were absent.  But David did not see it fit to adjourn themeeting to enable the plaintiffs to attend and to explain their case before other Board members.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> I now return to the defendantâs theme that she played a reluctant role in dismissing the plaintiffs.  She defendant relied on anumber of matters in support.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> First, she said she agreed to such a course after she had taken advice from knowledgeable people.  But she had been singularly unableto name the people that she had taken advice from.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> Second, she said she had received complaints from various members about the plaintiffsâ behaviour and she was urged to take action. But what the plaintiffs had done all took place before 7 August 2004.  The defendant herself said at the Review Meeting : let bygonesbe bygones.  There is no evidence before me to suggest that the plaintiffs had since 7 August 2004 spread rumours or otherwise misbehavedthemselves which justified their dismissal.  Although the defendant received the Letter on 12 August 2004, it was sent out by the2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff back on 4 August 2004.  It cannot possibly be evidence to show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff had âspread rumours or slandersâ against the defendant between 7 and 20 August 2004.  As noted, she said for the firsttime under cross-examination that the plaintiffs had caused chaos to SPS.  This I have already rejected.<a>[18]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> Third, she said the decision to terminate the plaintiffs was only made at the 20/8/04 Board Meeting.  But this is flatly contradictedby her own evidence in paragraph 68 of her witness statement (19 August 2004) and Davidâs Email (3 August 2004).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> Finally, she repeatedly said it was Davidâs decision to expel the plaintiffs and not hers.  Strictly it is correct that under SPSâs<a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, only David as director had the power to expel the plaintiffs.  But the defendant had no doubt played an important role in the process. She approached David as early as 3 August 2004; she proposed to David that he should act as director to expel the plaintiffs; shebriefed David about SPSâs situation which must include her disputes with the plaintiffs; she provided with David the emails exchangebetween her and the plaintiffs; and she was aware of the contents of the Notice of the 20/8/04 Board Meeting before it was issuedbut acquiesced in its misleading contents.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> When the evidence pertaining to calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting and the dismissal of the plaintiffs, which I accept, is consideredin the round, my findings are as follows.  The defendant was so offended by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs calling of the 4/8/04 Board Meeting and the plaintiffsâ insistence of forging ahead with it despite her stated intentionto the contrary, that she had since harboured grudges and animosity against them.  She then approached David as early as 3 Augustwith a view to dismissing them from SPS.  At the AGM and the Review Meeting on 7 August 2004, she acted as if she wanted to calmthe disputes down.  But actually she was continuing with her plan to procure the dismissal the plaintiffs from SPS without ado, whichsucceeded in the end.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> For completeness, I will deal with the evidence of Mr Wong briefly.  In his witness statement, Mr Wong seemingly has given evidencewhich tends to support the defendantâs case.  But when he was cross-examined about the details of his version of the events, heoften said he could not remember or recall or that he had no knowledge.  He also readily accepted that the story he was told by thedefendant was one-sided and he had never contacted the plaintiffs, whom he did not know or meet before, to verify the story.  Insuch circumstances, I agree with Mr Ng that his evidence is of little value.  I will not attach any weight to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">K. The Open Letter</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> On 21 August 2004, the defendant issued the Open Letter to all members of SPS.  As to why it was necessary to issue the Open Letter,the defendant said in her witness statement thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">71.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">A Notice of the Announcement Meeting was prepared and was sent out on 21<sup>st</sup> August 2004 together with a letter to SPS members. As the termination of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs had become well known in SPS and rumours were spread, it was necessary to stop such rumours by giving members the necessaryinformation about the matters that had taken place in SPS.  Accordingly, the Open Letter was issued with the Notice of the AnnouncementMeeting so that members had the opportunity to raise any question at the Announcement Meeting and I could clarify them.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">L. The Announcement Meeting</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> The Announcement Meeting was then held to explain to members the reasons for the termination.  David did not attend.  Leeling attendedand explained the matter on his behalf.  The defendant attended and gave her own views on the matters.  After giving a speech onher feelings, she dealt with the Letter point by point by way of a transparency projected by an overhead projector.  I do not thinkit is necessary to dwell on details.  It is basically the plaintiffsâ version against the defendantâs, which depends on theircredibility.  As I have demonstrated above, the defendant is a thoroughly bad witness.  On the other hand, I find the plaintiffstruthful and reliable.  They have given consistent and unshaken evidence.  I therefore reject the defendantâs version and acceptthe plaintiffsâ.  In any event, what the plaintiffs said in the Letter does not, in my view, amount to wrongful accusations, rumoursor malicious slanders.  The defendant had gone much over the top in so alleging.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> I now turn to the defence of justification.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">VII.

The power rests with the director.  And the director is not obliged to giveany reason for dismissal.  Thus the defendant was not under any duty to explain to the members about the plaintiffsâ dismissal. He further submitted that whether there is a duty for a the purpose of qualified privilege is a question of law and it is thereforenot sufficient that the defendant honestly believed that it was his duty to speak : see <i>Gatley</i> at para. 14.15 at p. 393. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> I fully accept that under SPSâs <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, the defendant is not under a legal duty to explain to members the reason for the plaintiffsâ dismissal.  However, she as the chairpersonwas plainly under a duty, commensurate with her office and within the reasonable expectation of the members, to do so and the membershad a corresponding interest in knowing the reasons for the dismissal, especially when the plaintiffs were long-serving, dedicatedand senior members of SPS.  In fact, what the defendant did was consistent with what happened when Bruce and Sheeta were dismissedfrom the Board in November 2003.  At the AGM held on 17 January 2004, the defendant in her capacity as the chairperson did explainthe reasons for their removal from the Board, although she was not involved in the process of deliberation of their removal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> Mr Ng next complained that it was unnecessary and unwarranted for the defendant to send the Open Letter indiscriminately to all membersof SPS when the Announcement Meeting had already been fixed for the purpose of explaining to members why the plaintiffsâ membershipwas terminated.

Mr Kwan submitted that she did by taking a number of points.  Forpresent purposes, I need only deal with the following matters relied on by Mr Kwan in order not to over burden this judgment, althoughI have already considered them all carefully.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> Mr Kwan referred to the defendantâs allegation on the alleged power struggle within SPS which she first saw in November 2003 shortlyafter she joined SPS.  The power struggle was allegedly led by two members called Bruce and Sheeta.  But the undisputed evidenceshows that Bruce and Sheeta were dismissed by reason of their misconduct.  Nancy said in paragraph 6 of her witness statement :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ãç±æ¼ä»åæ¼çå½ç±ç·çä¸ç¶è¡çºåä¸åä½çæåº¦ï¼çäºææå¡æ±ºå®ä»¥çå½ç±ç·çå©ççºåæï¼å¾çäºæéé¤ä»åççäºè·ä½ãã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">In her evidence-in-chief, Nancy said she disagree with the defendantâs allegation that Bruce and Sheeta were dismissed because ofpower struggle.  Significantly, Nancy was not cross-examined on this part of her evidence at all.  Further, what Nancy said is consistentwith the contemporaneous documents.  In her email date 14 November 2003 to the defendant, Nancy asked her to sign the removal letterfor expelling Bruce and Sheeta from the Board.  Nancy mentioned nothing about power struggle at all.  In the removal letter whichwas signed by all Board members including the defendant, again no allegation of power struggle was laid against Bruce and Sheeta. It stated that they were dismissed because of misconduct in these terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">ãæåä¸è´èªçºä½ åå©ä½æè¿çä¸è² è²¬ä»»è¡çºï¼å·²ç¶å´éæå®³äºæåèä½ åå©äººçä¿¡ä»»ååä½éä¿â¦â¦ã</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I accept Nancyâs evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a> It should be noted that the defendant admitted under cross-examination that she subscribed to the view as expressed in the removalletter, which does not support her case on power struggle.  Further, when the defendant was asked to elaborate what power Bruce andSheeta could seize, she only said that it had something to do with Nancy.  This is of course false in light of Nancyâs unchallengedevidence.   I have no doubt that it is a recent fabrication.  I reject the defendantâs evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a> I am not satisfied that there was power struggle back in November 2003 as alleged by the defendant.  I agree with Mr Ngâs submissionthat the defendant made this up in order to boost her case that there had been power struggle that she needed to deal with aftershe became the chairperson and that the plaintiffs were involved in such power struggle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a> Mr Kwan relied on the defendantâs allegation that she knew that the plaintiffs wanted to kick her out of SPS.  But there is noevidence to substantiate the allegation that the plaintiffs wanted to kick her out at all.  I cannot see how the defendant couldhave honestly held such belief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a> Mr Kwan relied on the defendantâs allegations on the plaintiffsâ conduct to support her perception of their involvement in seizingpower such as :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">They had had led mass resignations in June 2004.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">They kept her at the dark about the mass resignations and she only came to know about it on 19 July 2004.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff deliberately did not send the Letter to her at the time.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Letters contained false allegations against the defendant.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(5)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The plaintiffs had caused chaos to SPS.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I have already rejected all these allegations.<a>[20]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a> Mr Kwan referred to the defendantâs oral evidence that the power that the plaintiffs wanted to seizure took two forms.  For âformalpowerâ, the plaintiffs wanted to get rid of the defendant as chairperson.  This I must reject in the absence of any supportingevidence.<a>[21]</a>  For âinformal powerâ, the plaintiffs wanted to control and influence others to yield by using drastic measures like mass resignationsand spearing untrue slanders against her.  In light of my findings on those matters, there is simply no substance in this allegationat all.  The defendant then referred to the allegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs worry that the police volunteers would take over SPS.<a>[22]</a>  She said the plaintiffs were afraid that their control and influence in SPS would be undermined.  Whether or not the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff did say that he feared that police recruits joining SPS would take over SPS and they joined for promotion is disputed. If need be, I accept the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs evidence that he did not.  But even if he did, I fail to see how the defendant could have honestly read his concernsin the way as she did.  In my view, it is a mere afterthought.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a> Mr Kwan referred to certain events after the issue of the Open Letter as evidence to corroborate the defendantâs case that therewere power struggle before.  He first referred to the Announcement Meeting and submitted that the power struggle became more apparentafter the plaintiffsâ dismissal.  I have viewed the video clip of the Meeting and read the transcripts of the Announcement Meetingcarefully.  Members put questions to Leeling and the defendant about the plaintiffsâ dismissal.  In the middle of the Meeting,the plaintiffs were allowed to join.  The atmosphere of the Meeting was certainly not friendly.  Occasionally it was charged emotionally. But I fail to see how it supported any power struggle as alleged.  Mr Kwan next referred to a purported EGM held on 25 September2004 to release the defendant from all position in SPS.  Obviously, the EGM was held because some members were extremely dissatisfiedwith the defendantâs conduct in handling the plaintiffs.  Again, I fail to see how one can reasonably regard that as power struggle. Finally, Mr Kwan referred to the defendantâs evidence that at the end of 2004, a group led by Mr Albert Cheng, legislative councillor,tried to intervene in SPSâs affairs.  This may or may not be true.  But it is not evidence that there was power struggle at thetime when the Open Letter was issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a> Mr Kwan submitted that the defendant subjectively believed in the truth of the Words.  I disagree.  The evidence before me has overwhelmingestablished that she either did not honestly believe in those wholly untrue statements or was reckless as to whether those statementswere true or not when she published the Open Letter.

The same approach should be adopted as regards persisting, unsuccessfully,with the plea of justification at trial: of itself, such conduct is not evidence of malice, but a jury may infer malice if the defendantrefuses to withdraw the defence at trial having called no evidence to support it, or it is abundantly plain that the defamatory statementis untrue.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a> On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the defendant put forward the defence of justification in relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> Imputations with knowledge that it is unsustainable.

Hongkong Standard Newspaper Ltd</i> at p. 536G-H :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">âAs the circumstance of each libel are likely to differ and the factors to be taken into account depend on the facts of each individualcase, it is difficult to extrapolate from previous awards unless there are significant similaritiesâ¦â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a> Here, when assessing general damages, I bear in mind the undisputed fact that the plaintiffs were long-serving, experienced, dedicatedand loyal volunteers of SPS.  But the Words, especially the 5<sup>th</sup> Imputation, seriously attacked and undermined their personality, integrity and loyalty to SPS.  And the harm was done to them beforeall members of SPS, the Open Letter having been circulated to all of them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a> Further, given the defendantâs malice in publishing the Open Letter, it is only right to award aggravated damages.  In this connection,I refer to my findings on malice in <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Part IX</a> above.  The fact that the defendant did not offer any apology to the plaintiffs when she was asked to do so by the letter beforeaction is, in the circumstances of the present case, also a relevant factor that supports an award of aggravated damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a> Having carefully considered all the circumstances, I shall award as general damages HK$200,000 and aggravated damages HK$200,000to each of the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">XI.
