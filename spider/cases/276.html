Work was completed on 21 January 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Plaintiff claims that the renovation work undertaken by the Defendant generated excessive vibration and noise causing seriousdamage to the Plaintiff's Flat. In that, cracks appeared on the ceiling over the living room, kitchen and toilet, cracks also appearedon the walls, further damages were caused to the main door and the door frame and power failure had resulted.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> As a result of the noise and vibration and the damages caused to her flat, the Plaintiff claims that she lost the use of her flatfor 16 months and had to have the damages repaired.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiff's cause of action against the Defendant is under nuisance, negligence and Rylands v. Fletcher liability.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Defendant does not dispute there was renovation work undertaken at his flat (Flat 12B) between 4 December 2000 and 21 January2001. The only dispute is whether excessive vibration and noise was generated in the process of the renovation, and whether it wasthe renovation work that caused the damages complained of by the Plaintiff. There are certain differences in the Plaintiff's pleadedcase and the evidence of the Plaintiff Madam Hui, the pleading stated that her premises were newly renovated before her return tothe flat in December 2000, this was denied by Madam Hui in Court, she claimed that at the time she had returned from a 2 weeks holidayand her flat was not newly renovated. These may have been caused by miscommunication or misunderstanding between the Plaintiff andher lawyers.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> It is Madam Hui's evidence that she and her husband purchased Flat 11B for their own use, her daughter lived in the same neighbourhoodwhere she paid frequent visits. In December 2000, after a two weeks visit to Beijing, she returned to her home in Flat 11B to findcracks appearing in the ceiling of her flat and some of the tiles covering the timber at the ceiling of her kitchen had fallen ontothe floor. She further experienced excessive noise and vibration generated from the flat above. Upon inspection of Flat 12B, shefound a workman working thereat and she claimed she saw a jack hammer lying on the floor. She alleged that the flat had already hadits partition walls removed by the time she inspected it. She further saw debris consisting of concrete and steel bars left at therear staircase of Flat 12B. Later on, on 12 December 2000, she went up to Flat 12B again with Mrs. Leung from Flat 13B and they toldthe workman to stop the work because of the excessive noise. It is her evidence that the work did stop for a short while, but inthe days that followed work had commenced again.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Madam Hui claimed that further damage was done to her flat after the Defendant's resumption of renovation work. She produced exhibitP.1 (pages 55 - 68 of the bundle) - photographs on pp.55 to 59 taken on 22 December 2000 and 59 - 68 on 17 June 2001. It is her evidencethat she had to move to her daughter's home because of the poor and dangerous state of her flat. She found in the days following12 December 2000, after the Defendant's husband Mr. Cheung visited her premises, not only were there further cracks appearing onthe ceiling of her flat, dust and concrete pieces began to break and fall, gradually power failure in the flat took place and themain wooden door and frame had sunken and the door could not be closed.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff's survey report prepared by Prudential Surveyors International Limited (hereinafter called "the said surveyor firm")in October 2001 confirmed the findings of spalled concrete in 5 locations based on inspections that took place on 8 May and 17 June2001. Photographs were taken on those two occasions, and it was discovered on 17 June 2001 when the surveyors removed the false ceiling,air-conditioning fan coil and air duct in the toilet that large chunks of concrete had fallen from the ceiling to the false ceilingin the toilet. (see pp.28 - 40 of the bundle).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Plaintiff's surveyors did not investigate the cause of the defects that appeared in the Plaintiff's Flat 11B.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Defendant's husband Mr. Cheung Yau Cheung (DW1) gave evidence and confirmed that on 12 December 2000 he had been contacted bythe management office about the noise and vibration caused by the work done at the Defendant's flat, it was a week after commencementof the renovation work. He went to inspect the Defendant's flat and the Plaintiff's flat that same afternoon and had told the workmanto stop work for one day. He inspected the Plaintiff's flat because the Plaintiff had complained that the renovation work had causedcracks on the ceiling and kitchen tiles had become detached in her flat. He claimed that no jack hammers were used or seen at Flat12B, though a electric drill and hammers were used. By that time, the two walls he had wanted to remove had been demolished completely.He denied the two walls were load bearing walls, and claimed they were brick walls.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> He claimed that he could see at the Plaintiff's flat the ceiling had shown signs of spalling concrete and rusty steel bars were visiblewhen he visited the Plaintiff's flat on 12 December 2000. He denied the subsequent work done at his flat had caused any excessivevibration or noise because further work performed after the demolition of the two partition walls involved removal of tiles in thesmall toilet. He personally heard no excessive noise or experienced any vibration, but admitted he would only visit the renovationsite 3 - 4 times a week at night after he finished work at his office.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The documentary evidence agreed by the parties included the Incorporated Owners' Association's meeting minutes of 12 December 2000,9 January, 12 February, 22 February and 7 March 2001 (pp.83 - 110 of the agreed bundle) and the annual general meeting minutes of25 November 1999 (p.121 - 125 of bundle). Further evidence agreed are the 3 letters from the building's management company on theinstructions of the Incorporated Owners' Association to the Defendant dated 18 January, 19 January and 27 February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> These minutes of meeting and letters revealed that the Plaintiff and the registered owner of Flat 13B had complained to the IncorporatedOwners Association and the management company about the excessive noise and vibration caused by the Defendant's renovation work atFlat 12B. There were further complaints of a cracked wall in the corridor of the public area of the 11th Floor caused by the Defendant'srenovation work on the 12th floor and queried if the two walls removed by the Defendant at Flat 12B were load bearing walls. Thecracked wall on the public area of 11th floor apparently had been repaired by the Defendant. The removed walls were later confirmedto be non load bearing.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> It is Madam Hui's evidence that the Defendant's husband Mr. Cheung (DW1) had agreed to repair the damage done to her flat at the12 December 2000 visit. However, she had insisted on obtaining a surveyor's report on the extent of the damages before the repair,this was not accepted by Mr. Cheung (DW1).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Defendant's expert witness DW2 Mr. Tsang King Man, a registered Structural Engineer produced a report after his inspection ofthe Plaintiff's flat on 26 January 2002 (pp. 41 - 52 of the bundle). The report had taken into account the photographs taken by thePlaintiff's surveyors and those by the management office on 22 December 2002 and 17 June 2001 (pp.55 - 68 of the bundle).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is DW2 Mr. Tsang's evidence that the earlier photographs of 22 December 2002 and 17 June 2001 showed evidence that the ceilinghad already started spalling, and that spalling would have taken place at least one year before the photographs were taken. Thatthe spalled concrete was caused by corrosion of the steel bars inside the concrete causing expansion in volume of the bars leadingto spalling concrete. The second complaint of detached kitchen tiles was actually caused by insufficient use of glue on the tiles.He claimed that the third complaint of cracks on walls could not be found at the Plaintiff's flat. His conclusion was that the damagesin the Plaintiff's flat was not due to vibration from the Defendant's decoration work.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> From the evidence adduced before me including the evidence revealed in the agreed bundle, it is obvious that the Defendant's renovationwork had caused a great deal of noise and vibration to the neighbours in flats above and below the Defendant's flat. Complaints hadbeen made to the management company and the Incorporated Owners Committee within a few days of the commencement of the Defendant'srenovation work. On 12 December, these complaints were put before the Incorporated Owners' special meeting. (See p. 83 of the bundleitem 1.1). Furthermore, at the meeting on 9 January 2001, there was a complaint that the Defendant's renovation work caused a crackalong the corridor on the 11th floor. (see pp. 089 - 90 items 3.2, 3.8 and 3.9).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> There is therefore no doubt that the nature of the renovation work undertaken by the Defendant was noisy and disruptive, these hadcaused her neighbours to file complaints to the management company and the Incorporated Owners Committee at the time of the work.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The question to be decided is whether the noise and vibration caused the damages complained of by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The Plaintiff's counsel submitted that there are 4 issues involved, namely:</p>    <p class="heading">Issue I - Whether the vibration and noise generated by renovation works at the Defendant's premises constituted an actionable nuisance?</p>    <p>I have been referred to para. 19-06-07 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 18th ed. It states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A private nuisance may be and usually is caused by a person doing, on his own land, something which he is lawfully entitled to do.His conduct only becomes a nuisance when the consequences of his act are not confined to his own land but extend to the land of hisneighbour by:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) causing an encroachment on his neighbour's land, when it closely resembles trespass:</p>            <p class="quote">(2) causing physical damage to his neighbour's land or building or works or vegetation upon it; or</p>            <p class="quote">(3) unduly interfering with his neighbour in the comfortable and convenient enjoyment of his land.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">It may be a nuisance when a person does something on his own property which interferes with his neighbour's ability to enjoy his propertyby putting it to profitable use. It is also a nuisance to interfere with some easement or profit or other right used or enjoyed withhis neighbour's land."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Examples of the second type of nuisance are:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Nuisances of the second kind, causing physical damage to land or to something erected or growing upon it, occur when a man allowsa drain on his own land to become blocked or makes a concrete paved drive so that the water overflows onto his neighbour's land,maintains a mound of earth or other artificial erection on his own land so as to cause damp to enter his neighbour's land, worksthe mines under his own land so as to cause the surface of his neighbour's land to subside, allows building upon his land to becomedilapidated so that they, or parts of them, fall upon his neighbour's lands, sets up vibrations on his own land which cause damageto his neighbour's buildings, or emits noxious fumes from his land which damage his neighbour's crops or trees."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Examples of the third type of nuisance are:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Nuisances of the third kind, causing an interference with the enjoyment of land, are, for example creating stenches by the carryingon of an offensive manufacture or otherwise, causing smoke or noxious fumes to pass on to the plaintiff's property, raising cloudsof coal dust, making unreasonable noises, or vibration."</p>        <p class="quote">"Recent dicta in the House of Lords suggest that nuisances of this third kind "will generally arise from something emanating fromthe defendant's land, and that the exceptional cases which do not satisfy this requirement "may go to the limit of the law of nuisance".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Based on the evidence of the Plaintiff Madam Hui and the complaints lodged with the Incorporated Owners Committee by other owners,I have no doubt that the renovation work undertaken by the Defendant at Flat 12B had been a nuisance to her neighbours because ofthe excessive noise and vibration generated.</p>    <p class="heading">Issue 2 - Whether the principle in Rylands v. Fletcher is applicable such that the Defendant would be liable for the loss and damagesuffered by the Plaintiff?</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The rule in <strong>Rylands v. Fletcher</strong> as stated in Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts 18th ed. para. 5-56 is:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher</em> A person who brings and keeps upon his land something which is likely to do damage if it escapes does so at his peril and consequentlyhe cannot excuse himself for the escape on the ground that he had employed a competent contractor to place and confine the matterin the position from which it escaped."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> This rule had been, however, given a restricted interpretation by the House of Lords in <strong>Cambridge Water Co. Ltd. v. Eastern Countries Leather plc.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20AC%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 A.C. 264.</a> Their Lordships took the view that in principle the rule should be seen as little more than "extension of the law of nuisance tocases of isolated escapes." (para. 20-03 Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The Plaintiff relies on the case of <strong>Hoare and Co. v. McAlpine</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1923%5d%201%20Ch%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1923] 1 Ch. 167</a> where it was held that the Plaintiff's house though very old was not in such an abnormally unstable condition as to prevent the vibrationbeing treated as an ordinary actionable nuisance. The court in Hoare v. McAlpine applied the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The application of this rule as restricted by the House of Lords in the Cambridge Water case, clearly meant to be an extension ofthe law of nuisance. It is my finding that there was nuisance caused by the work at the Defendant's premises from the independentevidence of the numerous complaints lodged at the management company. The nature of the damage of the Plaintiff's flat and to thepublic corridor on 11th floor are consistent with the noise and vibration generated that affected not only the peaceful enjoymentof the Defendant's neighbours but the excessive force used in the removal of the partition walls and floor tiles was the cause ofthe damage to the Plaintiff's flat. The building in question was 12 years old at the time the incident took place, not an old building.Even if the ceiling in the Plaintiff's flat has begun to spall, had it not been for the vibration generated by the Defendant's renovationwork, there would not have been such damage to the flat to the extent as those complained of. As held in the case of Hoare v. McAlpine,her flat was not in such an abnormally unstable condition to prevent the vibration being treated as an ordinary actionable nuisance.</p>    <p class="heading">Issue 3 - Whether there was negligence on the part of the Defendant and/or its servant in carrying out the renovation works?</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiff submitted that the act of nuisance is committed by an independent contractor does not absolve the liability of theowner of the land. Para. 19-51 Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts, has this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Nuisance created by independent contractor</em> Whether a person can be said to be a wrongdoer if the nuisance is created by his independent contractor depends on whether he couldreasonably have foreseen that the work he had instructed the independent contractor to do was likely to result in a nuisance. InBower v. Peate, Cockburn C.J. said:</p>        <p class="quote">"A man who orders work to be executed from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences to his neighbour must beexpected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented, is bound to see to the doing of that whichis necessary to prevent the mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing someone else - whether it bethe contractor employed to do the work from which the danger arises or some independent person - to do what is necessary to preventthe act he has ordered to be done from becoming wrongful."</p>        <p class="quote">"In Matania v. National Provincial Bank, the occupier of the first floor of a building employed contractors to carry out alterationsto his premises. The work, by its noise and the dust it set up, was a nuisance to the occupier of the second and third floors andthe person carrying out the alternations was held liable for the act of his contractors "just as ...... if they had let the floordown".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The court in the case of <strong>Bower v. Peate</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%201%20QBD%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 1 QBD 321</a> confirmed the principle that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A man, - who orders a work to be executed on his own premises, lawful in itself, but from which, in the natural course of things,injurious consequences to his neighbour must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented-, is bound to see to the doing of that which is necessary to prevent the mischief; and cannot relief himself of his responsibilityby employing someone else to do what is necessary to prevent the act he had ordered to be done from becoming wrongful." (at p. 321).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The above principle applies fully to the present case. The Defendant must have foreseen that the excessive noise and vibration causedby the drilling and knocking down of the partition walls, the toilet and the kitchen floor would cause disruption to her neighbours'lives and damages to their properties. The fact that Defendant had employed an independent contractor to undertake the work of renovationdoes not exonerate her from being liable.</p>    <p class="heading">Issue 4 - Whether the renovation work carried out at the Defendant's premises was a material cause of the damages at the Plaintiff'spremises?</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The Plaintiff's Counsel, Mr. Wong, adopted para. 5-30 of Clerk &amp; Lindsell:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is not necessary to prove that the breach alleged was the whole or even the main cause of the accident. It is sufficient to showthat it materially contributed to the damage. When considering whether a claimant has established that injuries were caused or materiallycontributed to by negligence, the test to be applied is on the balance of probability and a cause can only be material if it is morethan minimal, trivial or insignificant. Such an issue is eminently for the decision of the trial judge on the basis of medical orother evidence and the Court of Appeal will be slow to interfere."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In the case of Bonnington Castings Ltd. v. Wardlaw  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] A.C. 613</a> at p. 621, Lord Reid said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The disease is caused by the whole of the noxious material inhaled and, if that material comes from two sources, it cannot be whollyattributed to material from one source or the other ...... and the real question is whether the dust from the swing grinders materiallycontributed to the disease ...... A contribution which comes within the exception <em>de minimis non curat lex</em> is not material, but I think that any contribution which does not fall within that exception must be material."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Further extension of the application of this concept can be found when considering foreseeability of the remoteness of damage. Para.202 of McGregor on Damages 16th ed. on p. 125 stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Existing states of affairs: physical abnormalities of the plaintiff or of his property. It has never been seriously disputed thatan admitted or established wrongdoer is liable for any increased injury to his victim by reason of an abnormal physical susceptibility.Kennedy J.'s statement of this principle in <em>Dulieu v. White</em> is well known:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"If a man is negligently run over or otherwise negligently injured in his body it is no answer to the sufferer's claim for damagesthat he would have suffered less injury, or no injury at all, if he had not had an unusually thin skull or an unusually weak heart."</p>        </blockquote>        <p>Or in the more concise words of Lord Wright in <em>Bourhill v. Young</em>: "If the wrong is established the wrongdoer must take the victim as he finds him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The authors of Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts 21st ed. p. 520 stated that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>The "egg-shell skull" rule</em> This sixth exception, to the effect that the amount of damage not to be foreseen, is illustrated by the well-established rule that,at least so far as the physical condition of the victim is concerned, abnormal circumstances existing at the time of the wrongfulact do not negative causal connection. So if the consequences of a slight personal injury are aggravated by the state of health ofthe person injured, the wrongdoer is nonetheless liable to the full extent, though he had no knowledge of that state of health andno reason to suspect it. So in the leading case of <em>Smith v. Leech Brian &amp;Co</em>. Ltd. it was held that if a victim of a negligent act suffers from a pre-cancerous condition which is activated by that act, thewrongdoer is responsible for all the disastrous consequences. This is always known as the "egg-shell skull" rule."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The aforesaid well-establish principles of law clearly support the Plaintiff's claim that though reinforced concerete at the ceilingof the Plaintiff's flat may have already been in the initial stages of corrosion and spalling concrete had started to set in, thevibration generated by the Defendant's drilling and demolition work would have materially increased the risk of damage and contributedto the damage caused.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> According to Mr. Tsang (DW2), it is not possible to estimate the time taken for reinforced concrete to be corroded and to spall resultingin the falling of pieces of concrete. As Mr. Tsang himself commented, it depends on many factors and it requires a great deal ofresearch and study to determine the relationship between the age of the building, exposure and the degree of deterioration. It ishowever undisputed that the amount of humidity, the quality of the concrete and exposure to air are factors affecting the spallingof concrete.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I find the evidence of Mr. Cheung (DW1) who claimed that he was able to see the rusty steel bars inside the concrete ceiling at thePlaintiff's flat on 2 December 2000 to be incredible. According to Mr. Tsang, the steel bars are covered with several centimetresof concrete in a normal reinforced concrete ceiling slab. If the reinforced concrete steel bars were already visible and exposedon 12 December 2000, they were not evident in the photographs taken on 22 December 2000 on p. 55 - 59. These photographs were taken10 days after Mr. Cheung visited the Plaintiff's flat, by that time work had re-commenced for over 10 days.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Under normal circumstances, it is unlikely for domestic premises to experience the kind of knocking and drilling work that had takenplace at the Defendant's premises. The work was so disruptive that a number of the Defendant's neighbours had lodge complaints tothe management company. The Plaintiff was not the only complainant according to the records of the minutes of meeting of the IncorporatedOwners Committee. The letters addressed to the Defendant warning her of the numerous complaints of damages done to other units inthe building reflected the position taken by the Incorporated Owners Committee. It is therefore reasonable to infer the Plaintiff'scomplaint is not isolated and for the Plaintiff to claim that the condition of her flat would not have been reduced to such a statehad the Defendant's renovation work not taken place. The Defendant's renovation work involved drilling and demolition of two partitioningwalls, removal of the flooring and tiles in the bathroom, the repositioning of the kitchen and the replacement of the plumbing andpipes in the flat leading to the corridor public area. Apart from the demolition of the two partition walls, most of the other workwas conducted after 12 December 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> There were further damages unrelated to spalling concrete in the Plaintiff's flat not explained by Mr. Tsang, such as the cracksin the ceiling seen on the lower photograph on p. 59 of the Plaintiff's kitchen area, the sunken main wooden door and frame and thepower failure. The evidence of these damages reflected the powerful force exerted by the drilling work and knocking down of the twowalls undertaken in the Defendant's flat. It is obvious that the force was so strong that the tiles covering the timber board overthe kitchen ceiling were knocked down to the floor although they might have been more secured had more glue been applied in the firstplace. From the evidence given by Mr. Tsang, he believed that the ceiling built of reinforced concrete had already been corrodedprior to the Defendant's renovation work. It is possible that the ceiling made of reinforced concrete had begun to be corroded, partsof it became loose and were further exposed when the excessive drilling and knocking expanded the gaps in the concrete resultingin further deterioration of the corrosion process. This perhaps explains why the ceiling concrete did not fall before the photographson pp. 55 - 59 were taken on 22 December 2000 until the cracks had allowed the corrosion to deteriorate and the expansion that tookplace further separated the concrete completely to allow pieces of ceiling to fall down later on. The differences in appearance canbe seen in the early photographs taken on 22 December 2000 (p. 55-59) and those taken on 17 June 2001 (pp. 64-68).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Though Mr. Tsang (DW2) claimed that the sample of the pieces of rusty steel bars he collected on his visit in January 2002 showedthat corrosion had set in for over two years or more, I am satisfied that the situation was aggravated by the force and vibrationgenerated from the Defendant's drilling work and the knocking down of the two partitioning walls. Comparing the condition of thepremises shown in the photographs taken on 22 December 2000 and those taken on 17 June 2001, the damage had clearly become more extensiveand pronounced. Large pieces of concrete had fallen in the later photographs from the living room ceiling though it is unknown whenthe ceiling concrete in the toilet had started to fall.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I accept the evidence of Madam Hui that her flat was intact in appearance before she left for her trip to Beijing in late November2000, that she returned in December and found tiles in the kitchen had fallen and cracks appearing in the ceiling of the living roomwith debris on the floor and there was partial power failure in her flat. I accept that she found building debris removed from theDefendant's flat deposited at the rear staircase, whether these may or may not contain reinforced concrete is not of great importance,suffice it to say there were a great deal of debris removed from the Defendant's flat. The fact that a crack appeared in the wallof the 11th floor corridor is further evidence of the force of the drilling work on the 12th floor corridor and inside the Defendant'sflat by the Defendant's workmen. Again, whether a jack hammer or an ordinary electric drill was used in the renovation process isnot the issue. The issues set out and explained above in paragraphs 22 - 34 may be summed up as whether excessive force was usedand whether the work had became a nuisance to the Defendant's neighbours causing damage to their properties and the quiet enjoymentof their properties.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The Defendant must take the Plaintiff's flat where she finds it. I am satisfied on a balance of probability, that the Defendant'srenovation work had speeded up the spalling and breaking off of the reinforced concrete ceiling in the Plaintiff's flat, it furtherknocked down the kitchen tiles, caused the Plaintiff's main door frame to collapse, cracked the Plaintiff's kitchen ceiling and causedpower failure in her flat directly and indirectly. Consequently, the Defendant is liable to compensate the Plaintiff for her loss.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> As to the quantum of damages: The Plaintiff claims repair costs of $47,000 for re-instating the premises and a further claim of lossof enjoyment of her flat from January 2001 to April 2002 at $10,000 per month and a further sum of $10,000, the costs of survey report.</p>    <p class="heading">Repair Costs</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Madam Hui produced a quotation from the contractor Tung Kee Construction Co. Ltd. dated 8 March 2001 for the repair of the damageto her flat. The quotation and receipt for payment are found on p. 77 - 78 of the bundle. For some unexplained reasons the renovationwork was not done until early 2002, more than one year after the Defendant's renovation work completed. The price charged by TungKee, however, remained the same as the quotation in March 2001. The re-instating work by Tung Kee took 20 odd days according to MadamHui. I accept Madam Hui's evidence that she had bargained for a reasonable price from Tung Kee and it is reasonable for her to usethe same contractor the Incorporated Owners Association used. I find the repair costs reasonable and I allow it in full.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of Enjoyment</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The extent of the damage at the Plaintiff's premises is such that on 12 December 2000 it was impossible for her to stay for the noiseand vibration had been excessive, paint and plaster from the ceiling were falling in the living room and there was partial powerfailure at the flat.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The condition became worse in 2001 after the Defendant's renovation work completed on 21 January 2001. It is reasonable for the Plaintiffto stay away from the premises until her flat was re-instated and damages repaired. However, it would be unreasonable for her towait for a period of 16 months before returning to stay at her flat. It is possible to assume that she would be reluctant to letthe contractors in to repair the damage until the surveyors had made an assessment of the extent of the damage and took photographsof the condition of her flat. On the other hand, the assessment could have been made soon after the Defendant's work completed. Sheshould have mitigated her loss and not wait until early 2002 to get the repair done.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> It is not known why the Defendant did not obtain a report from her expert Mr. Tsang until after the Plaintiff issued a writ againsther. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff could still have had the damages repaired as soon as the extent of damages can be ascertained andnot wait until after the writ was issued.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> During the period of 16 months up to April 2002, the Plaintiff had been staying with her daughter who lived in the neighbourhood.She mentioned in her evidence that she was doing the cooking at her daughter's home. She insisted she has a right to keep her flatand stay there when she wanted to do so. She certainly has that right; however, it is then unlikely that she would have let the flatout pending the assessment of the damage to her flat.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> For the aforesaid reason, the Plaintiff is not entitled to recover loss of enjoyment of her flat at $10,000 per month for a prolongedperiod of time of 16 months. She is entitled to obtain alternative accommodation during the Defendant's renovation period becauseof the noise and the falling debris. Subsequently, after 21 January 2001, as there was power failure, the damaged door and fallingdebris from the ceiling, she is entitled to have the damages repaired after a reasonable period to ascertain the full extent of thedamage. As the quotation of repair was made in March 2001, one would have expected that the repair work would have taken place soonerafter. This delay was due to the Plaintiff's failure in getting the surveyors to inspect the premises before May and June 2001 andfor some unexplained reason the report was not prepared until October 2001. This shows the Plaintiff was not in urgent need to returnto live in her flat or Plaintiff was undecided as far as the repair work was concerned. The Defendant should not be expected to payfor the Plaintiff's indecision and inaction.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Based on my finding that the Plaintiff should have the premises repaired as soon as the Defendant completed the renovation work afterhaving the damage assessed, I assess under the head of loss of enjoyment, a compensation for a period of 4 1/2 months from mid-December2001 to end of April 2001 would be reasonable. I shall therefore allow the sum of $45,000 at $10,000 per month as compensation tothe Plaintiff's loss of enjoyment of her flat.</p>    <p class="heading">Surveyor's Fees</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> There was no suggestion from the Defendant that the amount of $10,000 surveyor's fee was unreasonable. I therefore allow it in full.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Plaintiff is entitled to recover the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Repair costs</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="50%">$47,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Loss of enjoyment of property</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="50%">$45,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Surveyor's fees</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="50%">$10,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="50%">_______</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="50%">$102,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td></td>                <td style="text-align:right">======</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Costs nisi - Costs follow the event, I cannot see any reason why the Defendant should not pay the Plaintiff's costs and I so order,with certificate for counsel with liberty to apply within 14 days.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(H.C.
