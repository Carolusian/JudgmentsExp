The actions were brought by the plaintiffs against the same defendants in respect of losses incurred on loans that provedirrecoverable. The defendants were solicitors and the claims brought against them were based on both contract and tort. The judgedismissed the claims and this appeal has been brought against that dismissal. At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal judgmentwas reserved which we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>The loans</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Although some of the basic facts are not disputed, facts that are crucial to questions of liability were in dispute at the trialand were the subject of this appeal. The key figure in the background of these cases was Mr Yan Kwok Kei, Gay ("Mr Yan"). He wasof a member of the Yan family which used to, and may still, operate the business of Yan Chim Kee, a well known candy and ice creammaker in Hong Kong. As will transpire, Mr Yan did not give evidence. Doubtless, if he had, the experience would not have been particularlycomfortable for him. The 1st plaintiff, Mr Leung Yiu Chown, Desmond ("Mr Leung"), referred to him as being dishonest. The full extentof his dishonesty may never be known.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Yan family owned a company by the name of Chapol Limited of which Mr Yan was a shareholder and director. The Yan family usedChapol as the vehicle to develop a site in Aberdeen called Yan's Tower. Sometime in late 1994, a Mr Patrick Ngai, who was a stockbrokerand a friend of Mr Yan, approached Mr Leung and told him that the Yan family were constructing a building in Aberdeen and neededmoney, approximately $5 million, for its completion. Mr Ngai asked Mr Leung whether he would be interested in making a loan. Theloan was to be for a short term, at an attractive rate of interest. Mr Leung had been to the same secondary school as Mr Yan andthe two of them had renewed their acquaintance in the 1980's. Mr Leung consulted his business partner, Mr Yip Sam Lo ("Mr Yip") andthey agreed to loan the money. Mr Leung put up $500,000.00 and Mr Yip and his wife Madam Tai Ruth Fung ("Madam Tai") put up $4,500,000.00.This has been referred to as the first loan and was the subject of HCA 14713 of 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> There was a loan agreement in respect of the first loan. That was dated 31 December 1994 and was exhibit P1. The parties to the loanagreement were Madam Tai, who was named as the lender, and Chapol, which was named as the borrower. The loan was for a term of 6months at 2.5% interest per month. Clause 9 of the agreement provided that in the event that the loan should become due and payableand remained unpaid then Chapol should sell the whole of the 17th floor of Yan's Tower to the lender at a price of $1,000 per squarefoot. The agreement was signed by Madam Tai and by Mr Yan on behalf of Chapol.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Madam Tai handed over a cheque for $5,000,000.00 to Mr Yan and in return received post-dated cheques for the principal sum and the6 monthly interest payments. The cheques for the interest were presented and ultimately all but one were honoured.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> There was then a supplemental agreement dated 30 June 1995. By that agreement the loan was extended by a period of 3 months and theprice of the 17th floor was increased to $1,400.00 per square foot. This agreement was exhibit P2 and was referred to as "the 1stsupplemental agreement". Again it was signed by Madam Tai and Mr Yan. Madam Tai received a number of cheques for the monthly interestbut, this time, it appears that only one of them was honoured.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> There was then another agreement between the same parties. This has been referred to as the 2nd supplemental agreement. It was dated2 October 1995. By that agreement the period of the loan was extended for a further 10 months. The units that were to be regardedas security were changed to the whole of the 16th floor and the price was reduced back to $1,000.00 per square foot. This agreementwas, again, signed by Madam Tai and Mr Yan and was exhibit P3. Finally, in respect of this loan it should be mentioned that therewas a supplemental agreement made between Madam Tai and Mr Leung. That was dated 7 January 1995. It recorded the fact that a loanof $5 million had been made to Chapol and that of that amount $500,000 had been put up by Mr Leung. It provided that Madam Tai wasto use her best endeavours to collect the interest payments and capital sum and to pay the 10 percent proportion of anything receivedto Mr Leung. That agreement was exhibited as exhibit P6.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> There was then a second loan. That loan was the subject of HCA 14712 of 1999. Mr Yan had told Mr Leung that he needed another $3,000,000.00.This time, Mr Leung and his friend Mr Wong Wan Hay ("Mr Wong") put up the money; Mr Leung put up $2,500,000.00 and Mr Wong $500,000.00.They used Goodresponse Investments Ltd ("Goodresponse"), a BVI company, as the named lender. This loan was made by one cheque for$1,000,000.00 deposited into an account of Yan Chim Kee Company Limited on 19 October 1995 and one for $2,000,000.00 dated 2 November1995 on which date the lenders acquired the BVI company. The latter cheque was deposited, again into the account of Yan Chim KeeCompany Limited on 3 November 1995 (see Transcript 11 June 2003 page 139).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The written agreement in respect of this loan was dated 4 November, copies of it were exhibits P4A and P4B respectively. Mr Leunghad kept one and Mr Ngai had kept the other. It is in similar terms to exhibit P1 save that the units that were to be sold on defaultwere 3 units on the 2nd floor of Yan's Tower and the price was $800.00 per square foot. Mr Wong signed the agreement on behalf ofGoodresponse and Mr Yan signed on behalf of Chapol. It is said that post-dated cheques for principal and monthly interest were handedto Mr Chow, the 1st-named defendant, but they have not been produced or otherwise accounted for.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It suffices to say that the loans were never recovered. Chapol was insolvent and wound up. The plaintiffs could not purchase thevarious units in Yan's Tower because there had been prior encumbrances on the title which made the agreements worthless. It may benoted, however, that according to Mr Leung's evidence, Mr Yan had told him that there had been no mortgages in respect of the property.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>The involvement of the defendants</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The 1st named defendant, Mr William Chow Wai Lam ("Mr Chow"), is a partner of the 2nd named defendant in the 3rd named defendantsolicitors firm. Mr Yan and his siblings were all friends of Mr Chow; his father and their father were also friends. There is nodispute that Mr Chow witnessed all the signatures on the various agreements, indeed his chop appears below his signatures.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The plaintiffs' case is that they relied on Mr Chow as their solicitor to advise them and at their request to draw up the loan agreementsand, in the case of the first loan, the two supplemental agreements and the P6 agreement. The claims are brought in both contractand tort. The plaintiffs' case is that in both instances, the liability in contract and tort co-existed, but in any event, even ifthere were no contract, for example because of the absence of consideration, then a liability in tort would still exist.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Chow denied having advised the plaintiffs, or having drafted the agreements. He said that he merely witnessed the parties' signatureson the documents. He said that he did that as a favour to Mr Yan. On any footing the first occasion on which Mr Chow had become involvedwas at a meeting on 28 December 1994 in his office. It would seem that Mr Yan had arranged it. Messrs Leung, Yip, and Yan attendedat Mr Chow's office. The judge found as a fact that at that meeting Mr Chow was asked by Mr Yip and answered questions about the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Moneylenders Ordinance</a> and whether it was legal to charge the interest rate proposed. The judge said that he did not accept that Mr Chow gave any otheradvice. The judge found as a fact, and this was based on what Mr Chow said when giving evidence, that on 31 December 1994 Mr Chowdid read through the agreement, one of the copies of which was exhibit P1, and commented that he had not made a land search. In summary,the judge's conclusion was that Mr Chow did no more than witness the parties' signatures on an agreement and the various supplementalagreements which he had not prepared.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In relation to the second loan Mr Leung gave evidence that sometime between 19 October 1995 and 2 November 1995 he telephoned MrChow and asked if there would be a problem using a BVI company as the lender. He said that Mr Chow had advised that there would notbe any problem. Mr Chow's evidence was that he could not remember any such incident. As will be seen, the judge found as a fact thatMr Chow did no more than witness the signatures on the document.</p>    <p class="heading">The documents</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Before turning to the specific allegations made by the plaintiffs it would be convenient to outline the state of the documents asthey exist. In respect of exhibit P1, the defendants' firm's chop appears on the backsheet, and the pages have been tied togetherwith ribbon at the top left corner and then sealed with sealing wax bearing the firm's seal. The signatures were witnessed by MrChow, whose chop appears below his signatures. The signatures on exhibit P6 were, again, witnessed by Mr Chow and his chop was affixedunderneath his signature. However, although the defendants' firm's seal was affixed to the top left-hand corner of the document,there is no ribbon nor is the firm's chop on the backsheet. Exhibit P2 does not bear the firm's chop on the backsheet and there isno ribbon or wax seal. It was signed by Madam Tai and on behalf of Chapol, Mr Yan acting as a director for that purpose, Mr Chowwitnessed those signatures. Again his solicitor's chop appears underneath his signatures. Exhibit P3 is in similar form to exhibitP2: Mr Chow signed as witness to the signatures of both Madam Tai and that on behalf of Chapol, with Mr Yan signing as director.Again Mr Chow's solicitor's chop appears but there is no chop of his firm on the backsheet, neither is there any ribbon nor wax seal.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The plaintiffs' case in the court below was that Mr Chow had acted for the plaintiffs. It was said that he had drawn up the variousdocuments that have been referred to above at the specific request of the plaintiffs and that he had advised the plaintiffs in respectof the loan agreements into which they had entered. It was said that Mr Chow had assured the plaintiffs that their interests wouldbe properly looked after and that in the event that Chapol failed to repay the loan as agreed the plaintiffs would be able to purchasethe relevant properties. The alternative case put on behalf of the plaintiffs at trial was that even if, for any reason, there hadbeen no contract of retainer, and in this respect specific mention was made of lack of consideration, because of the representationsmade by Mr Chow the plaintiffs were entitled to base their claim on the grounds of negligence (see for example paragraphs 50 and51 of the opening on behalf of the plaintiffs.). Certainly the opening argument on behalf of the plaintiffs made no suggestion thatthe plaintiffs relied on anything other than direct oral representations and statements alleged to have been made by the 1st defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In respect of the first loan Mr Leung said, in his witness statement, dated 12 May 2000, that the agreement for the loan had beenreached by the parties at Mr Chow's office on 28 December 1994 and that Mr Chow had undertaken to draft the agreement document personallyand that the plaintiffs' interests would be properly looked after. He also said that Mr Chow had said that in the event of a defaultby Chapol, the plaintiffs would be able to buy the property at the agreed price. Mr Leung went on to say that when the P1 documenthad been signed on 31 December, Mr Chow had advised the plaintiffs that their interests had been properly taken care of and thattheir right to purchase the property was secured. The statements of the two other plaintiffs in HCA 14713 of 1999, the action inrespect of the first loan, confirmed what was said in Mr Leung's witness statement.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The witness statements filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in HCA 14712 of 1999 were to similar effect. Mr Leung, for example, saidat paragraph 11 of his witness statement in that action that Mr Chow had produced the second loan agreement saying that it had beenprepared in accordance with the plaintiffs' instructions and that the plaintiffs' interests under the agreement were sufficientlyprotected. Mr Wong said, at paragraph 9 of his witness statement, that Mr Chow had produced the loan agreement in respect of thisloan and, again, that the plaintiffs' interests had been sufficiently protected under the agreement. He went on to say that he hadasked Mr Chow to ensure that any dealings or alienation of whatsoever nature should only be done with the plaintiffs' knowledge andconsent. Mr Wong said that Mr Chow had replied in the affirmative and it was on that basis that Mr Wong and executed the second loanagreement on behalf of Goodresponse.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> At the start of the written closing submission on behalf of the plaintiffs it was said in paragraph 2:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The key issue appears to be one of credibility. Given the time lapse between the relevant events and the relatively few relevantdocuments disclosed in this case, the inherent probability of the matter would play an important role in this issue."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> This aspect was taken up in the judgment. In paragraph 53 the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"53. This is a case which hinges on the credibility of the witnesses. Since there are no contemporaneous documents against which theevidence may be tested, save for the disputed documents themselves, one has to rely on the inherent probabilities of the situation.The impression which the witnesses make is also to be taken into account but I remind myself that demeanour is a matter on whichit is easy to be mistaken, and inherent probability is usually a better guide."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> That said, however, it is clear that the judge did not rely on inherent probability alone. In fact, quite to the contrary. He referredto the absence of Mr Yan taking any part in the case but went on to indicate that he could not hold his absence against either side.The judge then referred to the possible motives that either side might have in the case. On the one side there might be the wishto recover from an insurance company that would be behind Mr Chow and on the other would be a wish not to be tarred with the brushof professional negligence. The judge found neither factor convincing.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Having reminded himself that demeanour was often an unreliable guide to the veracity of a witness's evidence, the judge then wenton to consider the evidence of the witnesses. He said he did not find either Mr Leung or Mr Yip particularly impressive as witnesses.Mr Leung was quite evasive when asked about his education and experience; whilst the judge was prepared to discount that to a certainextent, it was, nevertheless, not a wholly insignificant point that part of the cross-examination revealed that Mr Leung was conversantwith land deals in the Mainland and had even obtained an MBA. Clearly he was not ignorant of business deals.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> There were more important aspects of Mr Leung's evidence in respect of which the judge was clearly entitled to take a dim view. Forexample the judge considered that Mr Leung's oral evidence of the first meeting was quite inconsistent with what he said in his witnessstatement. On the one hand it was clear that he had "agreed pretty well everything with Mr Yan before they went near Mr Chow" butthe witness statement gave the impression that the details of the loan agreement were first discussed at the meeting on 28 December.Reference to prior discussions with Mr Yan was absent from anything coming from Mr Leung until he gave evidence. Nor did the judgefind Mr Yip's evidence satisfactory.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The judge also expressed disquiet about a number of other matters arising from the plaintiffs' evidence. For example the divergencebetween the pleadings and the evidence as to what advice was given to Mr Yip and Mr Wong, the way in which the matter of repaymentwas dealt with in exhibit P1, the fact that Mr Leung's evidence as to reliance on Mr Chow's advice in respect of the second loanwas at odds with the fact that, on his own evidence, he had issued at least the cheque for $1,000,000.00, without speaking to MrChow at all and before the BVI company was acquired and that Mr Wong's evidence in respect of the second loan seemed rather doubtful,a matter which the judge considered called into question the evidence that Mr Chow gave advice about the effectiveness of the security.A reading of the transcript, in my view, leads to the impression that judge was certainly not unduly critical of the plaintiffs'evidence - he might well have been far more scathing.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The judge considered that Mr Chow made a rather better impression on him than did either Mr Leung or Mr Yip. He was straightforward,rather than evasive. Whilst Mr Chow had been criticised in submissions for having a selective recall, the judge considered that inview of the lapse of time, Mr Chow could not be expected to have anything but a patchy memory; importantly the judge considered thatMr Chow was not deliberately selective in what he could recall or not recall. The judge took into account that Mr Chow was a litigationsolicitor and thus, arguably, not necessarily trained to observe and recall. However, that was outweighed by the fact that the caseconcerned not so much the question of whose memory was likely to be better, but who was telling the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Turning to the matters which were not covered by the evidence, the judge took into consideration that there had been no evidenceas to who had drafted the various agreements, if Mr Chow had not done so. These were legal documents drawn up by a lawyer, or someonewho was legally trained or at least had access to precedents. The judge had well in mind the argument that "If Mr Yan had anotherlawyer who drew up the agreements, why would he not have taken the lenders to that lawyer, to get the agreements executed?"</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> One major argument taken on behalf of the plaintiffs on this appeal related to the fact exhibit P1 had been tied up with ribbon andhad a wax seal with the defendants' firm's chop on the backsheet. Exhibit P6 also had a wax seal (without any ribbon) though it doesnot have the firm's chop on the backsheet. It was argued that because those items must have been put there by someone in the defendants'firm, on the inherent probabilities, it must have been the defendants' firm's documents. A similar point was taken because MadamTai had been identified as the holder of a particular identity card in exhibit P1 in handwriting and in exhibit P2 in typescript.The judge was clearly not impressed by the latter point. I myself would add that it was, almost certainly, a bad point because thetypescript relating to the Identity Card was a different typeface to that in the body of exhibit P2 (most clearly seen in the differencebetween the "g"s) and neither exhibit P6 nor P3 contained details of Madam Tai's identity card. In fact once it is appreciated thatthe typefaces were not only different sizes but different styles, the point undermines the plaintiffs' case rather than strengthensit.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The judge recorded that Mr Chow could not explain the appearance of the documents except by saying that it was possible that hisstaff must have made mistakes. The judge also went on to say that it was unfortunate that Mr Chow's secretary, Rachel, had not beencalled to give evidence and that in her absence there was no evidence that she could not remember anything. That she has not beencalled is, of course, relied on as going against Mr Chow's credibility. I will refer to the matter of the appearance of the documentsbelow because it obviously forms a major plank of the plaintiffs' argument. It might be added for a different reason in the argumentpresented in the reply speech on this appeal than in the opening of the appellant's case on the appeal. In the opening the argumenthad been directed to showing that P1 and the other documents must have been prepared, i.e. drafted by Mr Chow. In the reply speechthe argument was that the appearance of exhibit P1 must have led the plaintiffs to believe that it had been drafted by them.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In the court below and in this court it was argued that the existence of exhibit P6 destroyed the defendants' case. If Mr Yan hadbeen using some other draftsman there was no reason for him or the plaintiffs to bring it to Mr Chow to be witnessed. The judge tookinto account the fact that Mr Chow could not give any reason for that, but he did not consider the matter conclusive.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> One important matter which the judge took into consideration was that he found Mr Chow's evidence about his firm's system of typingthe firm's name and address on the backsheet, and putting the file reference in the "footer" to be entirely credible.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The judge believed Mr Chow's evidence that he did not open any file for any of these "little favours" he did for Mr Yan. He discountedany notion that Mr Chow had been party to any fraud at the behest of Mr Yan and, indeed, that had not been a suggestion put forwardon behalf of the plaintiffs. In the light of that the judge considered it inherently extremely improbable that, if Mr Chow had draftedthese agreements, he would not have carried out a land search before and arranged for registration afterwards. This finding was juxtaposedwith a reference to the argument that because Mr Chow was a solicitor with over ten years' standing, (after practising as a civilengineer) his clear record of no claims in negligence against him told in his favour. The most basic steps in dealing with any contractrelating to land of carrying out a land search for encumbrances and then registering the contract were not carried out. The judgeconsidered that Mr Chow would not have survived for ten years in practice if he had got that wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The judge's conclusions as to the facts were as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"78. Having seen and heard the witnesses and considered the inherent probabilities of their respective evidence I find that wherethere is a conflict, I prefer the evidence of Mr Chow to that of the plaintiffs.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">79. It is clear that the first loan agreement was not made at the meeting on 28 December 1994 in Mr Chow's office. I accept that atthat meeting, he was asked and answered questions about the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Moneylenders' Ordinance</a> and the legality of the interest rate but not that he gave any other advice. I am not satisfied that Mr Chow was instructed to drawup the first loan agreement, or that he agreed to do so, or that he or his firm drew it up.

I accepthis evidence that they did not seem interested in the point, which is why he did not pursue the matter. I am not satisfied that atthat meeting Mr Chow was instructed to draw up the agreement P6 or that he did so, or did anything else in connection with it saveto witness the parties' signatures. The same applies to the 1st and 2nd supplemental agreements. I am not satisfied that on the occasionswhen they were signed Mr Chow made the representations averred.</p>        <p class="quote">81.

It follows that there was no contract, or series of contracts of retainer between the plaintiffs and Mr Chow and through his partnerand the partnership. The question remains whether he can be found liable to the plaintiffs in tort in either case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">This Appeal</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> On this appeal, Mr Warren Chan SC, who did not appear below, took up the theme of the inherent probabilities. He presented a casethat relied only on what he argued were indisputable facts and a very few of the documents. His theme was that the judge's conclusionas to the facts must have been wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> There were essentially three points taken by Mr Chan. The first was that it was inherently probable that the plaintiffs would lookto lawyers to prepare loan documents. This, Mr Chan argued, arose from the fact that the plaintiffs were not used to lending moneyand that they required legal advice. The second point was similar to the first, in that it turned upon the argument that the plaintiffswould naturally look to a lawyer in the preparation of the loan documentation and Mr Chow was the only lawyer known to be involved.There was no evidence of any mention having been made at the time that the plaintiffs had gone to any other lawyer. The third pointwas that the first loan agreement itself, exhibit P1, gave the appearance that Mr Chow's firm had prepared the document. Indeed,the argument went on, if the defendants' firm had not prepared the agreement there was no indication of which other firm had. MrChow had not given any evidence that he had asked Mr Yan who had drafted the agreement. Hence, the inherent probability was thatMr Chow's firm did act on behalf of the plaintiffs. Much turned on the argument that on the face of exhibit P1 it was a documentof Mr Chow's firm: a solicitor's firm would only prepare a document like that with the presence of its seal if it were its own document.In summary, it was Mr Chan's argument that the balance of probabilities must be on the side of the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As a subsidiary argument Mr Chan, in opening the appeal, argued that Mr Chow should have informed the plaintiffs if he were not actingfor them as their solicitor. In the opening, the argument based on tortious liability was very much a subsidiary argument.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> It was not until the afternoon of the hearing of this appeal, when Mr Chan commenced his reply speech, that he focused on what bythen had seemingly become his primary argument, namely, tortious liability as opposed to contractual liability. Reliance was thenput on passages taken from the speeches in <strong>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20830" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 830</a> at for example 835F where it was said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The touchstone of liability is not the state of mind of the defendant. An objective test means that the primary focus must be onthings said or done by the defendant or on his behalf in dealings with the plaintiff. Obviously, the impact of what a defendant saysor does must be judged in the light of the relevant contextual scene. Subject to this qualification the primary focus must be onthe exchanges (in which term I include statements and conduct) which cross the line between the defendant and the plaintiff. Sometimessuch an issue arises in a simple bilateral relationship. In the present case the triangular position is under consideration: theprospective franchisees, the franchisor company, and the director. In such a case where the personal liability of the director isin question the internal arrangements between a director and his company cannot be the foundation of a director's personal liabilityin tort. The inquiry must be whether the director, or anybody on his behalf, conveyed directly or indirectly to the prospective franchiseesthat the director assumed personal responsibility towards the prospective franchisees."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Mr Chan produced a separate skeleton at the commencement of his reply speech in which he set out 12 points which were said to beobjective facts which were relevant to this consideration. The nub of the case was as follows. That the lenders were looking forlegal advice and during the meeting on 28 December 1994 Mr Chow became aware of the substance of the loan transaction and gave adviceto the lenders in connection with it. Again when the parties came back to his firm on 31 December Mr Chow also answered questionsabout the loan agreement. In none of this did Mr Chow tell the lenders that he was not acting for them as their solicitor, despitethe fact that he told them he had not carried out a land search. There then followed the points in relation to the appearance ofthe documents, in particular exhibit P1, with the wax seal and the ribbon and the firm's chop on the backsheet.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In my view, the plaintiffs have come nowhere near being able to displace the findings of fact by the judge. Quite apart from thefact that the judge had the benefit of seeing the witnesses in reaching his conclusion, I see no basis for interfering with his findings.As I have already indicated, his decision was not based simply on the question of what was inherently probable. The witnesses' evidenceand his assessment of it formed an important part in reaching his decision. Moreover, once the judge had accepted Mr Chow's evidencethat the documents had not been prepared by his firm, acceptance of the evidence from the plaintiffs' witnesses became even moreproblematic. In this respect one telling feature, which the judge accepted, was Mr Chow's evidence as to the format which documentsprepared within his firm would take. Moreover, the insertion in typescript in exhibit P2 demonstrates that the insertion is hardlylikely to have been done on the same word processor as produced the document.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Reference has already been made to the question of the seal, which appeared on two of the documents, and the ribbon, which appearedon only one. Great play was made of these features on this appeal. However superficially attractive Mr Chan's bald assertion mayseem, these are not trappings of a firm that prepares a document so much as of a firm where a solicitor has witnessed it. Whenevera document is signed in front of a notary these items are attached to that document. The notary might be, but in many cases is not,the person who prepared the document. The notary's primary function is to witness and thus authenticate a document. Documents aresigned or sworn in front of the notary for certification purposes. This is a common occurrence. Every day the Registrar of the HighCourt authenticates some 30 to 40 notarised documents. These all have ribbons and seals of the notary's firm, not of the firm thatprepared the document. The ribbons and seals of notarised documents are in the same form as P1. Once it is appreciated that the attachingof a ribbon and the fixing of a firm's seal are something commonly done by a witnessing or authenticating solicitor, the supposedsignificance of these facts in this case evaporates.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The plaintiffs' evidence, that they had asked Mr Chow to draft the agreements and that he had agreed to do so and had done so, wasrejected by the judge. The consequence of that is that either the plaintiffs knew full well that Mr Chow had not drafted the agreementsand therefore that, even if they had been aware of the seals, the affixing of the ribbon on P1 and the seals on P1 and P6 was partof the witnessing process or, putting the best complexion on the matter from the point of view of the plaintiffs, they had been dupedby somebody other than Mr Chow, namely, perhaps, Mr Yan. That would have been a matter that could not be laid at Mr Chow's door.But even that does not explain the plaintiffs' evidence of directly asking Mr Chow for advice.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Sight should also not be lost of the fact that the condition of exhibits P1 and P6 does not appear to have formed any part of theplaintiffs' case until well after the trial started. Discovery of the original of exhibit P1 was only given on the first day of thetrial, 10 June 2003, and of exhibit P6 some 3 days later. The reference in paragraph 60(1) of the re-re-amended statement of claimin HCA 14713 of 1999 to P1 having been sealed by the defendants' firm's seal was something that was added without the plaintiffs'leading counsel's knowledge. The transcript at pages 62-3 shows the plaintiffs' leading counsel apologising for having said thatthere were only typographical changes to the amendments that had been proposed the previous day i.e. on the first day of the trial.Although there was the briefest of references to it in the closing written submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs, it was not untilthis appeal that any real reliance was sought to be put on the appearance of these 2 documents.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The only matter that I would comment on is that I would not myself, have placed reliance on the fact that Mr Chow had not in his10 years' practice been the subject of negligence proceedings. Nevertheless, the judge no doubt had in mind the clarity of Mr Chow'sown evidence when he said that if he had been acting for the plaintiffs the thing he would have done was to make land company searches.</p>    <p class="heading">Tortious liability</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Mr Chan's change of tack in his reply speech in this appeal in seeking to rely on tortious liability rather than contractual liabilitywas doubtless a recognition of the fact that by then it appeared that his primary case on the appeal was likely to fail. The argumentwas presented on the basis that an objective assessment would lead to the conclusion that Mr Chow had indirectly conveyed to theplaintiffs that he assumed personal responsibility in respect of giving advice on the loan agreements to the plaintiffs. Such anargument must be assessed in the light of the facts found by the judge. Sight, however, must not be lost of the plaintiffs' evidenceand the judge's rejection of it. Once the plaintiffs' evidence had been rejected, the plaintiffs' case on tortious liability hasto be viewed in the light of the fact that they had tried to construct a case of specific requests to and reliance on drafting byand assurances from Mr Chow, which the judge had held was not true. The plaintiffs' evidence was thus more than mere embellishmentand exaggeration. The judge found it to be false.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The judge rejected the plaintiffs' evidence that they had sought and obtained assurances from Mr Chow. He found as a fact that MrChow was witnessing their signatures to documents which had been produced to him. The plaintiffs had asked Mr Chow specific questions.Those had related to whether they could charge a high interest rate, whether they would have to be registered as moneylenders andwhether they could use a BVI company as a lending vehicle. But he did not accept the plaintiffs' further allegations. It may be thatMr Yan had previously, or at some other time, told the plaintiffs that Mr Chow would be looking after their interests. But that cannotgive rise to a tortious liability on the part of Mr Chow. As Lord Steyn said, the primary focus must be on things said or done bythe defendant or on his behalf. It has not been suggested that anything Mr Yan might have said not in Mr Chow's presence was saidon behalf of Mr Chow. Nor, in my view can it be right to impose tortious liability on Mr Chow simply because he did not say thathe was not acting on behalf of the plaintiffs when they had come for the purpose of having documents witnessed. It is not for thiscourt to uphold the judge's conclusion as I have outlined but then to invent some scenario different to that put forward by the plaintiffs,let alone the findings of fact by the judge, that would give rise to the conclusion that an objective observer would suppose thatMr Chow had undertaken to advise the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs had relied on that to their detriment, when their evidencehad been that they had relied on their own requests and the defendants' alleged positive responses but had not been believed in thatrespect.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The fact that Mr Chow read the documents and even, for example, explained the first loan agreement to Madam Tai does not indicatethat he was acting as her or the plaintiffs' solicitor. It is a very different thing for a person before whom a document is signedto have explained to him exactly what it is that he is signing and, on the other hand, a solicitor, who was acting for that person,advising the person as to what his legal rights are and as to what steps he should take to protect himself. In this respect I wouldrefer to the fact that the reason that an affidavit must be sworn in front of somebody other than that party's own solicitor is forthe very reason that the person swearing the affidavit should understand what he is swearing: see for example what was said by KayJ in his judgment in <strong>Bourke v Davis</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2044%20Ch%20D%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 44 Ch D 110</a> at p 126:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The commissioner's duty before he administers the oath is to satisfy himself that the witness does thoroughly understand what heis going to swear to; and he should not be satisfied on this point by any one but the witness himself. For this reason it has beenthe rule since Lord Hardwicke that the Court does not accept an affidavit sworn before the solicitor in the cause, nor his clerk,although he may be a commissioner."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> In this respect I would also draw attention to the fact that Mr Chan's first point that the lenders were looking for legal advicein connection with the making of the loan is a somewhat ambiguous point. It was certainly not the finding of the judge that the plaintiffshad made clear to Mr Chow they wished to received general advice in respect of all matters relating to the loan agreements. Neitherwere the plaintiffs the commercial innocents that Mr Chan tried to paint them. For example, Mr Leung was cross-examined into admittingthat he had an MBA. As such he might not have been familiar with land sales in Hong Kong but he might be expected to know when andhow to take legal advice. His evidence that he did so was rejected by the judge. That must have repercussions on the alternativeargument now advanced on his behalf that the circumstances were such that he thought he was being given legal advice and that herelied on it to his detriment.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I have already referred to the fact that the question of the appearance of the exhibits played no part in the plaintiffs' case inthe lead up to the trial. The only mention in the pleadings was in respect of exhibit P1 which only came into the pleadings on thesecond day of the trial and even then without leading counsel's knowledge. This, indeed, seems to have been a proper reflection ofthe fact that the plaintiffs' own evidence shows that these were not matters which had any effect on them at the time. The only referencein the plaintiffs' evidence to the appearance of these documents that I have been able to discover is in the course of the cross-examinationof Mr Leung. He was asked about the seal on exhibit P.1. The exchange was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Q. And did you notice at any time that the first agreement had a seal on it but none of the others did?</p>        <p class="quote">A. No, I didn't. Moreover, these documents were all kept by Ruth.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>(Tr. p. 127B)"</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Madam Tai and the other witnesses gave no evidence that the appearance of the documents had any effect on her or them. In the lightof all this one can only conclude, therefore, that the appearance of these documents had no impact whatever on the plaintiffs andcertainly there was no evidence that it led them to believe that the 1st defendant was acting as their lawyer and giving them legaladvice on the agreement and looking after their interest generally.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The belated attempt to construct an argument of tortious liability in the reply speech of the appeal, not based on an express agreementand positive acts such as drafting the documents, but based on the assumption of responsibility was a forensic manoeuvre. Untrammelledby any constraint that would arise from having appeared at trial, counsel was able to put forward an argument that lacked the necessaryevidential basis, to put it at its mildest.</p>    <p class="heading">Causation</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> One of the important questions which arises specifically in relation to a claim made in tort is the question of causation. Even ifit might be argued that the circumstances were such that it would have appeared to an objective observer that the defendants hadbeen acting in a way that the plaintiffs were entitled to rely on him, the plaintiffs still have to show that they did rely on whatthe defendants did or should have done. The plaintiffs' case was that they requested Mr Chow to draft the documents and that theyhad sought assurances from him and been given them. That was rejected. It would be a step too far for this court now to hold thatnonetheless the plaintiffs had justifiably considered that Mr Chow had been giving them advice and looking after their interests.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> In relation to the second loan the matter is, if anything, worse for the plaintiffs. The judge held at paragraph 90 of the judgmentthat because the first payment of $1 million in respect of the second loan had been made on 19 October 1995 without any referenceto Mr Chow, nothing that Mr Chow had done could have caused any loss. In opening the appeal Mr Chan's submission might have deflectedattention from this aspect since it was merely said that the plaintiffs accepted the exclusion of the $1 million as a matter of quantum.This was not a mere matter of quantum, it was a question of the plaintiffs' case failing in this regard. It appears that the matterwas not the subject of full argument in the court below because the same reasoning on the judge's findings of fact would apply tothe remainder of the second loan. The second cheque was dated 2 November 1995 and had been paid into Yan Chim Kee Company Limited'saccount the next day. On the judge's finding of fact, Mr Chow had done nothing until 4 November.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> When this point was put to Mr Chan in the course of argument his first response was that the cheque could have been stopped. Clearlythat argument was an adventurous argument not founded on any document or reference to the evidence. The documents that were referredto in the transcript at page 139 were not exhibited and were not part of the appeal documents. One can only take it, therefore, thatwhat Mr Leung had agreed to in that passage was correct. Not surprisingly, Mr Chan fell back on the argument that the point had notbeen raised in the notice of appeal. That, however, was a sterile point. The argument presented no difficulty as regards any findingof fact nor did it take the plaintiffs by surprise to the extent that they could not raise whatever arguments were open to them.In those circumstances, had it been relevant, that would have been an additional ground which would have debarred the plaintiffsrecovering in respect of the second loan.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In the circumstances I would therefore dismiss this appeal with an order <em>nisi</em> of costs in favour of the defendants.</p>    <p><strong>Hon Le Pichon JA:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with an order <em>nisi</em> that costs be in favour of the defendants for the reasons given in the judgment of the Vice President. I would only add the followingbrief observations to underline what I perceive to be a major difficulty in the way of the appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The plaintiffs' case, whether in contract or in tort, was based on a common set of facts. The positive case put forward on behalfof the plaintiffs in the appeal from HCA 14713 of 1999 ("the plaintiffs") was conveniently summarised by the judge in paragraph 16of his judgment. Importantly, the plaintiffs sought to found a cause of action based upon factual allegations that at the first meetingon 28 December 1994, Mr Chow had agreed that he would personally draw up the loan documents, that the loan would be secured by theproperty, that he would look after the interests of the plaintiffs and that the documents to be drawn up by him would enable theplaintiffs, in the event of default, to buy the property at the agreed price; that at a further meeting on 31 December 1994 attendedby the plaintiffs, Mr Yan and Mr Chow, Mr Chow produced the written agreement and made representations that the interests of theplaintiffs had been properly taken care of. For convenience, these allegations together constitute what is hereafter referred toas "the plaintiffs' positive case".</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> It was common ground between the parties that at the first meeting Mr Chow was asked and answered questions concerning that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Moneylenders Ordinance</a> and the legality of the interest rate. So far as the plaintiffs' positive case outlined above was concerned, that was rejected bythe judge. I agree with the Vice President that the plaintiffs have not made out a case for displacing the findings of fact so made.Based on those findings, there was no question of the plaintiffs succeeding on their case based on contract. But the rejection ofthe plaintiffs' positive case has other ramifications relevant to the alternative claim in tort. It led inexorably to the conclusionthat the plaintiffs knew that Mr Chow had not drafted the loan agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> The plaintiffs' alternative case in tort was put on the basis that even if there had been no contract of retainer for any reason,for example, through lack of consideration, the defendants would still liable in tort on the basis of assumption of responsibility.(See paragraph 50 of the opening submissions of the plaintiffs' counsel at the trial below.) The alternative case was therefore basedon the same, rather than a different, set of facts. The rejection of the plaintiffs' evidence of their having instructed Mr Chowto draw up the first loan agreement or that he had agreed to do so or that he or his firm had drawn it up, assumes considerable significancein the context of the question of assumption of responsibility on the part of Mr Chow. Unless the facts as found warranted the inferencethat he had assumed responsibility vis-Ã -vis the plaintiffs in respect of the loan transaction, the claim in tort would also fail.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Mr Chan SC sought to argue that Mr Chow had put himself in a position where the plaintiffs might have supposed that he was actingfor them. Thus, it was said that the first loan agreement gave the appearance that the defendant firm had prepared the document.I do not propose to dwell on the question of the appearance of the loan document which bore the firm's chop on the backsheet, thefirm's seal and the ribbon. Suffice it to say that I share the view of the Vice President that these trappings have little significance.But, in my view, once the plaintiffs' positive case has been rejected, the ramifications flowing from that rejection sit uncomfortablywith the factual matrix required to support the inference of an assumption of responsibility on the part of Mr Chow. In other words,it necessarily affects the "relevant contextual scene" mentioned by Lord Steyn in his speech in <strong>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20830" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 830</a> at 835F. Given that the plaintiffs' positive case that Mr Chow was acting for them and looking after their interest was disbelieved,I fail to see how it could be said that, viewed objectively, the plaintiffs were led into supposing that Mr Chow was acting for themfrom things said or done by Mr Chow.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> It would have been very different if, for example, the plaintiffs' claim had arisen in respect of specific advice concerning the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Moneylenders Ordinance</a> given by Mr Chow to the plaintiffs. In that scenario, assuming that no claim existed in contract because of an absence of consideration,there would have been scope for a claim based on the assumption of responsibility. But that is not the present case.</p>    <p><strong>Hon Yuen JA:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The factual background of this case has been set out in detail in the judgment of the Vice-President. I agree that on any view, theappeal of the plaintiffs in HCA 14713 of 1999 (the lenders of the 2nd loan) must be dismissed, because the money was lent beforeMr Chow's involvement in respect of that loan.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> However, in respect of the appeal of the plaintiffs in HCA 14712 of 1999, the lenders of the 1st loan (referred to below as " thelenders"), I consider that the appeal should be allowed on the ground that, even on the undisputed facts, Mr Chow is liable to themin tort by reason of his assumption of responsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Before turning to that discussion, I should say a few words about the judge's rejection of the lenders' primary case vis-a-vis theiralternative case based on assumption of responsibility. The judge rejected the lenders' evidence that there had been an <em>express</em> oral retainer and assurances by Mr Chow that he would look after their interests. However the judge did accept that they were innocentvictims who consulted Mr Chow only and no other lawyers, parted with $5,000,000 on the strength of documents such as "P-1", and whosuffered loss when the loan was not repaid and they could not obtain the property as provided for under the documents.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Thus the fact that the judge disbelieved the lenders' evidence of <em>express</em> retainer and assurances does <em>not</em> inexorably discredit their alternative case based on Mr Chow's assumption of responsibility and their reliance on it. They may nothave received the express assurances from him that they alleged, but it does <em>not</em> follow that Mr Chow's acts, viewed objectively in the context of previous words and acts, and their effect should be ignored. Solong as the component features of the alternative case are not refuted by the findings of fact made by the judge, liability is stillestablished. In my view, on an analysis of the facts, undisputed or found, and the components of the duty in tort, the lenders areentitled to judgment on the basis of assumption of responsibility.</p>    <p class="heading">Undisputed facts</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The undisputed facts showed that Mr Chow had, in a professional capacity, advised the lenders on certain legal aspects of the proposedloan (viz. the legality of the interest rate and the applicability of moneylending legislation) when he was aware of the proposedsecurity arrangement (that in default of repayment, the lenders were to acquire certain property at a given price). Four days later,the lenders saw him at his office again. A Loan Agreement (which appeared to have been prepared by his firm) was produced for thelenders to sign. Mr Chow explained the terms of the Loan Agreement, which <em>purported</em> to provide the lenders with the security discussed at the earlier meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In my judgment, a duty of care arose when (1) Mr Chow assumed a responsibility towards the lenders by holding himself out as advisingthem on the legal aspects of the proposed loan and putting through the transaction and (2) as Mr Chow knew or must have known, thelenders reasonably relied on his professional skill as a lawyer and proceeded with the loan.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> That duty of care was breached when Mr Chow failed to inform the lenders that, contrary to their expectations, the Loan Agreementwas <em>not</em> effective in law in putting the security arrangement into place. Nor did he inform the lenders that, contrary to the appearance ofthe Loan Agreement, his firm had <em>not</em> drawn up the Agreement. The lenders received no suggestions that they might wish to consult another legal adviser before they partedwith their money in Mr Chow's office.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> It was common ground that the lenders suffered loss when, in default of repayment by the borrower, they had no recourse to the property.</p>    <p class="heading">No liability in contract</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The liability in tort is separate and distinct from liability under contract. On the findings of fact made by the judge, there wasno express retainer. Nor, in my view, could there be an implied retainer, because the judge found no evidence that Mr Chow's firmhad intended to accept any consideration from any party and thereby to enter into any contractual relationship.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Duty of care - from assumption of responsibility</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> However, the undisputed facts show a clear case of assumption of responsibility which, coupled with knowledge of reasonable reliance,gave rise to a duty of care. The principle of assumption of responsibility is now settled as a result of three House of Lords cases,starting with <strong>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465.</a></p>    <p class="heading">- Hedley Byrne v Heller</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> In <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>, the House of Lords held that a duty of care may exist in respect of words (as well as acts) and liability may arise in negligencein respect of pure economic loss (not parasitic upon physical damage), where a party seeking information or advice from a party possessedof a special skill trusts him to exercise due care, and the latter party knew or ought to have known that reliance was being placedon his skill.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The House of Lords held that the duty to take care applies not only to fiduciary relationships, but to all special relationshipswhere the above circumstances exist. The categories of special relationships are not closed (486). A special relationship (or moreprecisely, a relationship in which there is a special duty of care) arises when the defendant has assumed a responsibility towardsthe plaintiff. In <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>, the bank would have been held liable for an incorrect credit reference about its customer given to a third party, had it not beenfor an express disclaimer of responsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Lord Morris held (502-3):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I consider that ... it should now be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertakes, quite irrespectiveof contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relies upon such skill, a duty of care will arise".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Devlin used the term "assumption of responsibility" in the following passage (528-9):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think therefore that there is ample authority to justify your Lordships in saying now that the categories of special relationshipswhich may give rise to a duty to take care in word as well as in deed are not limited to contractual relationships or to relationshipsof fiduciary duty, but include also relationships which in the words of Lord Shaw in <em>Nocton v Ashburton</em> are 'equivalent to contract', that is, where there is an assumption of responsibility in circumstances in which, but for the absenceof consideration, there would be a contract".</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">- Henderson v Merrett</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> In <strong>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a>, the House of Lords held that managing agents may have assumed a responsibility giving rise to a duty of care towards both directand indirect Lloyds Names, even though there was in place a contractual "chain" structure between Name and members' agent, and betweenmembers' agent and managing agent, with contractual constraints in each part of the chain.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Lord Goff, who gave the leading speech, unreservedly acknowledged that the principle of assumption of responsibility gave rise toa duty of care. He held that within the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> principle, a duty of care arises from (1) an assumption of responsibility and (2) knowledge of reasonable reliance; and (3) whenloss results, there is no requirement for the court to embark on a further enquiry whether it is "fair, just and reasonable" to imposeliability for economic loss (181D <strong>cf Caparo plc v Dickman</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605</a>, 633B).</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> It was held that the liability is not confined to statements, but may apply to any assumption of responsibility for the provisionof services, and that an assumption of responsibility by a professional person may give rise to liability in respect of negligent<em>omissions</em> as much as negligent acts of commission (181F).</p>    <p class="heading">- Williams v Natural Life</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In <strong>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20830" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 830</a>, the House of Lords applied the principle of assumption of responsibility to find a director of a company personally liable to theplaintiff for the misstatement of the company. Lord Steyn, giving the leading speech, referred to "the assumption of responsibilityprinciple" enunciated in <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> as extended in <strong>Henderson v Merrett</strong>, and in answer to some academic criticism, re-affirmed it on the ground that there was "no better rationalisation for the relevanthead of tort liability" (837).</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In <strong>Williams</strong>, the parameters of the principle were stated in the following passages:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The touchstone of liability is not the state of mind of the defendant. An objective test means that the primary focus must be onthings said or done by the defendant or on his behalf in dealings with the plaintiff. Obviously, the impact of what a defendant saysor does must be judged in the light of the relevant contextual scene. Subject to this qualification, the primary focus must be onexchanges (in which term I include statements and <em>conduct</em>) which cross the line between the defendant and the plaintiff. ... The inquiry must be whether the [defendant] or anybody on hisbehalf conveyed directly or indirectly to the [plaintiff] that the [defendant] assumed personal responsibility towards the [plaintiff]"(835)(emphasis added).</p>        <p class="quote">"If reliance is not proved, it is not established that the assumption of personal responsibility had causative effect" (836).</p>        <p class="quote">"The test is not simply reliance in fact. The test is whether the plaintiff could reasonably rely on an assumption of personal responsibilityby the individual who performed the services ..." (837).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I now turn to the application of that principle to the undisputed facts in this appeal, focussing on Mr Chow's words or conduct <em>as they appeared objectively to the lenders at the time</em>, and not on what his explanations for those words or conduct were at trial.</p>    <p class="heading">Professional setting</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The first meeting between Mr Chow and the lenders was held at his office, not in a social setting or on an informal occasion. Indeedall subsequent meetings were held in a professional setting at his office (<strong>Henderson v Merrett</strong>, 179D, 181E).</p>    <p class="heading">Giving legal advice</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> At the first meeting, there were discussions of a legal nature which were pertinent to Mr Chow's professional skill. The proposedloan transaction, including the security arrangement, was known to him (Chow, transcript p.248 H-K). It is notable that in paragraph7.3 of the Re-Re-Amended Defence, it was pleaded by Mr Chow that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Mr Yan's only purpose in arranging the Meeting had appeared to be for him to elicit from the 1st Defendant [Mr Chow] a general viewas to whether <em>an agreement of the type already reached could have legal effect</em> ..." (emphasis added).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The lenders made some inquiries about the law relevant to the <em>specific</em> transaction proposed, i.e. the legality of the actual interest rate and whether a licence was required for them as individuals tolend money. Mr Chow gave them legal advice. He was there (or more precisely, the lenders were at his office) for no other purpose.He never advised them to consult other lawyers or even asked if they had other lawyers. The objective impression given to the lendersmust have been that he was there providing professional service to the parties on the proposed loan transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> As noted above, the security for the loan, which was in the form of the right to acquire property at a stated price, was discussedat the meeting (Chow, transcript p.284 I-K). It was thus obvious to all present (including Mr Chow and the lenders) that the lenderswere looking to the property effectively as security for the loan.</p>    <p class="heading">Loan Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> A few days later, the lenders were asked to attend Mr Chow's office again for the purpose of executing a loan agreement. Even thoughthe judge did not accept the lenders' evidence that <em>they</em> had <em>expressly</em> instructed Mr Chow to draft document "P-1", he found (paragraph 79, judgment) that the document "must have come from Yan", in otherwords, not from the lenders who were presented with a document which on its face indicated that it had been produced by Mr Chow'sfirm. There was no finding that in law, Mr Chow could not have provided service for both the borrower and the lenders in the drawingup of a loan agreement. It was a commercial document where both parties' interests converged in a loan being provided on terms agreedbetween them. In any event, even if Mr Chow could not have acted for both parties, there was no evidence that the lenders knew orwould have known of such a restriction.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> When the Loan Agreement was produced in Mr Chow's office for execution by the parties, it would have reasonably appeared to the lendersthat this was intended to put into place, amongst other things, the security discussed a few days before. Why else would such a document,expressed in legal language and containing all the trappings of a legal document, be produced for the parties' execution at Mr Chow'soffice, if not to make the agreed arrangement effective in law?</p>    <p class="heading">Appearance of Loan Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The Loan Agreement which the lenders were given at Mr Chow's office had the trappings of a document prepared or adopted by that firm.The document was bound by a ribbon affixed with the firm's wax seal. The document was not notarized, so that would not have beenthe reason for the affixing of the firm's seal (even as a substitute for the notary's personal seal). More importantly, the firm'sname was on the backsheet which, on Mr Chow's own evidence, indicated the firm that had prepared the document (Chow, transcript p.253U- 254A). The document with the backsheet attached was produced in court as one document and it was <em>never put</em> to Ruth Tai Fung the signatory that the backsheet was added only after execution. There was <em>no</em> evidence that it was added afterwards and the court should not act on Mr Chow's speculation when he gave evidence in defence (Chow,transcript p.254).</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> I am not prepared to assume, and there was no evidence to the effect, that a solicitor who had merely <em>witnessed</em> a document would put the name of his firm on the backsheet. The act of witnessing the execution of a document is performed by thesolicitor as an individual. His firm has nothing to do with that act.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> The impression given to the lenders was therefore that Mr Chow's firm had drawn up the Loan Agreement. The judge did not make anyfindings of fact that any of the lenders did not believe this to be the case. Even if the evidence were to show a mistake on thepart of Mr Chow's staff in affixing the firm's seal and firm's name on the document, Mr Chow would have to be vicariously responsiblefor their actions. In any event, the lenders could hardly be expected to know of any mistake and there was no evidence at all thatthey knew of any mistake.</p>    <p class="heading">Explaining the terms</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Mr Chow's own evidence was that he had <em>explained</em> the terms to Madam Tai including clause 10 which as worded gave the impression that the property was not mortgaged. Mr Chow was notasked to <em>interpret</em> it because Madam Tai could read English (Tai, transcript p.210 J-K). There was no interpretation clause in the Loan Agreement, whichconfirms that what Mr Chow did was <em>not</em> to interpret the terms but to explain them (Chow, transcript p.252 F-J). By explaining the terms, he went beyond what a solicitormerely witnessing a document is bound to do (<strong>Law Wan-lan v Well-Built Development Co Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20435" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 435</a>, 442E).</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Most importantly, he did not tell the lenders that, even though he had given them legal advice on the same matter only four daysearlier, and even though the Loan Agreement looked to all intents and purposes as if it had been prepared by his firm, his only role<em>now</em> was to merely act as witness to the execution.</p>    <p class="heading">No sufficient disclaimer</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Of course, a duty of care would not arise if there was a suitable disclaimer of responsibility. Mr Chow's evidence at trial was thathe said to the signatory Madam Tai that he had "not done a search on the property". He was "not all that sure" that he said to herthat she should do one (Chow, transcript p.251 E-G). Of course the evidential burden was on him to prove that he had said anythingmore than that he himself had "not done a search on the property".</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Even though Mr Chow's evidence was that he had spoken to Madam Tai, it was <em>never put</em> to her during cross-examination that Mr Chow had ever said anything about a land search to her. In any event, there was no evidencethat Madam Tai (whose evidence was not criticized by the trial judge) knew what a land search was. There was no cross-examinationabout whether she knew or should have known the effect of Mr Chow's not having done one on the transaction being concluded by theexecution of the Loan Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Mr Chow said in his evidence at trial that he considered that that "should have told Ruth and Yan that I was acting for neither ofthem because in conveyancing matters the first thing that any solicitor would do ... is to run a land search" (Chow, transcript p.251I-K). In my judgment, that is not a reasonable inference to draw, and particularly so when Madam Tai had not been cross-examinedon this point. Doing a land search is technical work done by lawyers, and doing one, or not doing one, or when to do one, is a decisionmade within a lawyer's professional expertise. For a lawyer to simply say to a lay person that he had "not done a search of the property",without explaining the significance of it (Chow, transcript p.300L), is not a sufficient disclaimer of responsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> To draw an analogy in a different profession, it is as if a doctor said to a patient in the middle of treatment that he had not takena swab. What is the patient to make of it? The patient hearing that statement would simply expect the doctor to deal with it, asit was a technical matter within the doctor's professional knowledge and expertise. It is not surprising that Mr Chow's evidencewas that he received no reaction from Madam Tai to his comment (Chow, transcript p.251S-T). Mr Chow said (in the judge's words) "noone seemed to be interested in this so he assumed that they either did not know of any prior mortgage or did not care about it",so he said no more. First, if the lenders did not know of any prior mortgage, then there was all the more reason why they shouldhave been alerted to the possibility of one. Secondly, as to not caring whether there was a prior mortgage, it would be extraordinaryfor private individuals lending a substantial sum of money for the first time on security not to care if the security was effective.If security did not matter, why have it at all? Why would they have needed to attend his office on New Year's Eve to sign a documentwhich was not worth more than the paper it was written on?</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> If Mr Chow had been trying to exempt himself from liability, in the light of the legal advice he had given the lenders four daysbefore, and given the appearance of the Loan Agreement, he should have put that message across in clear and unequivocal terms, e.g.by saying that the Loan Agreement had not been drawn up by him, or that he was there to witness the execution of the document only,or that the lenders signed the document at their own risk, etc. He did none of the above, and the lenders cannot reasonably be expectedto second-guess what he was trying to say from a vague statement referring to what would appear to a lay person to be a matter oftechnical procedure.</p>    <p class="heading">Statement as confirmation of role</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Indeed, the statement in my judgment has objectively the effect of confirming his involvement with the Loan Agreement otherwise thanas a mere witness. Why would a mere witness to the execution of a document have to do a land search, or say that he had <em>not</em> done one?</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In my judgment, the objective facts listed above show clearly that after Mr Chow met the lenders and advised them as a lawyer onaspects of the proposed loan transaction, and followed that four days later by explaining the terms of the legal document that purportedto put through the transaction (a document that bore his firm's name), he had objectively conveyed to the lenders that he assumeda responsibility towards them in providing his professional services to put the proposed transaction into legal effect.</p>    <p class="heading">Trial judge's rejection of assumption of responsibility</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> The trial judge however held that there was no assumption of responsibility because he accepted Mr Chow's evidence that he was onlyacting as a witness. He likened Mr Chow's position to that of the solicitor in <strong>Law Wan-lan</strong> whose only participation was to act as witness to a document. In my view, <strong>Law Wan-lan</strong> was entirely different because the solicitor in that case had not given prior legal advice to the plaintiff on the matter, thus establishinga relationship of trust.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Based on his view that Mr Chow was only acting as a witness, the judge held (judgment para. 86):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"to say that he must have expected them to think he had drafted the documents and therefore had a duty to warn them that he had not,and also that they were at risk, would put his duty far too high; it would produce the sort of situation where no solicitors couldundertake the most trivial or casual matter without being at risk himself".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> With respect, given the appearance of the Loan Agreement, an objective observer would reasonably have thought that Mr Chow's firm<em>had</em> drafted the document. Further, I would not characterize Mr Chow's participation at the first meeting at his office as being "trivialor casual". A substantial sum was involved, serious matters were being discussed in his professional law offices and he was thereto render professional service to lay persons.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowledge of reasonable reliance</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The trial judge did not reject the alternative case on any other grounds and there has been no respondent's notice. Accordingly inmy judgment, that is enough to allow the appeal of the plaintiffs in HCA 14712/1999. In any event, it is clear from the evidencethat Mr Chow knew or ought to have known that the lenders reasonably relied on his professional skill. They were private lenders.Mr Chow admitted in evidence that it was obvious to him that they had not lent money before (Chow, transcript p.285 Q-R). They askedhim for advice about the legality of the interest rate and licensing requirements, and Mr Chow admitted in cross-examination thathe knew his advice would be relied upon (Chow, transcript p.287 I-J). They asked for the terms of the Loan Agreement to be explained.They would not have done that if they had other lawyers on whom they relied or could rely. Having shown caution asking about specificlegal concerns, it was unlikely that they would have risked their money in the transaction had they known that their interests werenot protected after all.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Applying the principles established in the three House of Lords cases discussed above, it is clear in my view that a duty of carehad arisen from Mr Chow's assumption of responsibility in the knowledge of the lenders' reasonable reliance on his professional skill.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Breach of duty of care</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> I then turn to the breach of that duty of care. It was not disputed (in the pleadings or at trial: Defendants' counsel, transcriptp.239 F-H) that the Loan Agreement did <em>not</em> have the effect of providing the lenders with the security they had bargained for. However, despite having explained the terms tothem, Mr Chow did <em>not</em> warn the lenders that the effective security they expected and was ostensibly given may not have been put in place. In law, it mattersnot that the breach of duty arose from a <em>failure</em> to inform. That failure was a negligent omission on the part of a professional person (<strong>Henderson v Merrett</strong> 181F). After the Loan Agreement was signed and the sum of $5,000,000 changed hands, the lenders' fate, as it were, was sealed. Thesubsequent agreements were along the same lines. It was not suggested by the defendants that anything the lenders did, or did notdo, after the execution of the Loan Agreement and the payment of the sum, contributed to or exacerbated the loss.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Loss</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> The trial judge accepted that the lenders suffered loss when the borrower proved to be worthless (judgment, paragraph 1). The judgedid <em>not</em> find that the lenders were in collusion with the borrower to obtain money from Mr Chow's firm or their insurers 5 years after theevents took place. The judge did <em>not</em> find that the transaction was not genuine, nor did he find (despite using the term "disputed documents") that the documents werenot authentic or anything other than what they purported to be. The fact that the lenders had suffered loss as a result of the breachof duty is therefore clear.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> By reason of the above, I would dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiffs in HCA 14713/1999 with costs to the Defendants, but I wouldallow the appeal of the Plaintiffs in HCA 14712/1999 and order that they have the costs here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Rogers VP:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> There will therefore be an order as set out in paragraph 53 above.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Maria Yuen)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Warren Chan, SC and Mr M C Chiu, instructed by Messrs George Tung, Jimmy Ng &amp; Valent Tse, for the Plaintiffs/Appellants</p>        <p>Mr Simon Westbrook, SC, instructed by Messrs Herbert Smith, for the Defendants/Respondents</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <appeal>Appeal dismissed: see FACV18/2004 dated 4 November 2005</appeal>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/255.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
