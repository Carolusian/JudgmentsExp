The defendant provided the pallet jack and roller trolley to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant knowing and intending that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant should use them for the transportation of the stentering machine.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â59.    â¦ That unsafe system of transportation was clear to anyone and everyone who was there to see it to realize that it wasan unsafe system as was made clear from the evidence of Ip (the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs supervisor).  Moreover, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had a hand in that unsafe system in that it had supplied the equipment and therefore had assisted in perpetrating thatunsafe system of transportation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> As the learned judge recorded, Ip (the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs supervisor):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â33.    â¦ agreed that he thought it was âextremely unsafeâ when he saw the calendering unit being transported by the palletjack and bearing trolley as there was a risk that the calendering unit might topple over. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> On such findings, I am of the view that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant owed a duty of care to persons who might be injured by the unsafe use of the pallet jack and trolley.  Just as a personwho allowed his lorry to be used intending or knowing that it would be used to carry an excessive and dangerous load owes a personalduty of care to other road users.  The fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was an independent contractor is not sufficient to negate liability.  We are not concerned with vicarious liability butthe duty of care of a person who permitted its chattel to be used in an obviously dangerous way.  Stone J, whose judgment I alsohave had the opportunity of reading in draft, relies on what Lord Goff said in <i>Ferguson v Welsh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20WLR%201553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 WLR 1553</a>,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ of the ordinary householder who calls in an electrician; and the electrician sends in a man who, using an unsafe system establishedby his employer, creates a danger in the premises which results in his suffering injury from burns.

I have in mind, rather, a case where the householder lends a faulty (or unsuitable) ladder knowingthat it would be used by the employer in an obviously unsafe manner, resulting in injury to his employee or someone else who wasin the vicinity.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> I agree with the analysis of Cheung JA that a clear case of negligence was made out against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as a joint tortfeasor, and the appeal should be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Cheung JA :</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff obtained judgment from Suffiad J in the sum of $2,569,786 together with interest and costs against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants in respect of personal injuries he sustained in an industrial accident.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant now appeals against the judgment in respect of liability. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The background</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff was an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the operator of a factory which carried on the business of âPU coating of cloth for the manufacture of waterproofgarments such as windbreaker and raincoatâ.  The machines that were used by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant included a stentering machine.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant engaged the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to do repair and maintenance work for the stentering machine.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The stentering machine was a huge machine.  It had a detachable calendering unit (âthe unitâ).  The unit was also big and heavy. It was about 1.68 m in height, 7 m in width and 2.5 m in length.  It comprised of a steel frame, two cylinders, a motor and othermetal parts.  The unit was about 1.5 tonnes in weight.  The unit was designed such that the centerlines of the cylinders were notaligned with that of the unit.  As a result, the centre of gravity of the unit was not centrally located. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> On 10 June 2000 the plaintiff together with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant attended the factory to do repair work.  This required the unit to be detached and removed from the stentering machineso that repair and maintenance can be done on the unit. After the unit had been detached, the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant used a pallet jack and a roller bearing trolley to transport the unit.  The pallet jack was inserted into the undersideof the unit on one side of it and the trolley was placed under the other side of the unit.  After they had repaired the unit, whichwas resting on the pallet jack and the trolley, they pulled it back to about five or six meters near its original position withinthe stentering machine.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In order to push back the unit into its original position within the machine a second pallet jack was used.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant first jacked up one end of the unit using the first pallet jack so that a second pallet jack could be inserted underneaththe front part of the unit.  Two pieces of wood were also placed on the forks of the second pallet jack by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  When the second pallet jack had been inserted into position, the forks of the first pallet jack were lowered so as toallow the unit to rest on the second pallet jack.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> When that was done, the plaintiff took hold of the handle of the first pallet jack while the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant attempted to jack up the second pallet jack in order to enable the first pallet jack to be pulled out from underneath theunit and then pushed the unit backwards by about 1 meter using the second pallet jack on which the unit now rested. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> When the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was attempting to jack up the unit with the second pallet jack, the plaintiff heard him said that the forks of the secondpallet jack would not rise.  On hearing that the plaintiff came over to the front.  At that moment the unit began to topple towardsthe plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The plaintiff tried to push back the unit with his hands but it was too heavy for him and as a result the unit fell ontop of him and crushed both of his legs.  Later on firemen and ambulancemen arrived at the scene and rescued the plaintiff underneaththe toppled unit. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The two pallet jacks and the trolley were equipment in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs factory.

Firstly, the fork of the pallet jack was only 1.5 metres long, but the calendering unit was 2.5 metres long, as a result,a bearing trolley was placed under the other side of the calendering unit to transport it.  The bearing trolley was not connectedto the pallet jack at all and in that sense the equipment used to transport the calendering unit was not itself an integral unitbut two wholly separate pieces of equipment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">36.    Secondly, the calendering unit had a height of 1.68 metres and when put on the pallet jack which, when jacked up with the calenderingunit on it, the calendering unit on the pallet jack would be taller than a person.  The calendering unit was some 1.5 tonnes in weightwith a cylinder of some 500 kg at the top part of it.  Given Ipâs evidence when the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant used the pallet jack to transport cloth, they normally see to it that the cloth placed on the pallet will not be tallerthan a normal personâs height, therefore the method employed to transport the calendering unit on the pallet jack must result inthe calendering unit, when sitting on the pallet jack, being top heavy thereby increasing the risk of its toppling over.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">37.    Thirdly, no steps were taken to secure the calendering unit in any manner whatsoever, when it was being transported on thepallet jack, to minimize the risk of its toppling over.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">38.    Fourthly, the placing of two pieces of wood on the second pallet jack in order to raise the calendering unit higher than otherwisethe pallet jack could show it to be a makeshift system designed to move or transport the calendering unit in any way and with whateverequipment is available but without any proper regard to safety measures.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiff had previously pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was his employer.

The Law Commission was of the view that the danger arising from some activity for which the person sought to be made liable is notresponsible in his capacity as an occupier of the premises will continue to be treated in accordance with ordinary principles ofnegligence at common law, see <i>Revill v.

The council had contracted the work to Mr. Spence who illegally subcontracted it to the subcontractor.  The work was carried outin a dangerous manner and the plaintiff sustained serious injuries.  The plaintiffâs case against the council was unsuccessful. Lord Keith of Kinkel dismissed the appeal by concentrating on section 2(4) of the 1957 Act (i.e. section 3(4) of the <i>Ordinance</i>).  His view was agreed by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Griffiths and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Lord Keith was of the view that if the plaintiff was a lawful visitor and a common duty of care under section 2(2) was owed to him,the Council would still have a valid defence under section 2(4) because the Council had engaged a contractor whom it had reasonablegrounds for regarding as competent.  Section 2(4)(b) of the 1957 Act (i.e. section 3(4)(b) of the <i>Ordinance</i>) provided that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger due to the faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repairby an independent contractor employed by the occupier, the occupier is not to be treated without more as answerable for the dangerif in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor and had taken such steps(if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properlydone.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Lord Keith after referring to that section held at page 1559 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe enactment is designed to afford some protection from liability to an occupier who has engaged an independent contractor whohas executed the work in a faulty manner.  It is to be observed that it does not specifically refer to demolition, but a broad andpurposive interpretation may properly lead to the conclusion that demolition is embraced by the word âconstruction.â  Furtherthe pluperfect tense employed in the last words of the paragraph âthe work had been properly doneâ might suggest that there isin contemplation only the situation where the work has been completed, but has been done in such a way that there exists a dangerrelated to the state of the premises.  <b><u>That would, however, in my opinion, be an unduly strict construction, and there is no good reason for narrowing the protection affordedso as not to cover liability from</u></b><b><u>dang</u></b><b><u>ers created b</u></b><b><u>y a</u></b> <b><u>ne</u></b><b><u>gligent</u></b> <b><u>act or omission by the contractor in</u></b><b><u>the course of his work on the premises.</u></b>  It cannot have been intended not to cover, for example, dangers to visitors from falling masonry or other objects brought aboutby the negligence of the contractor.  It may therefore be inferred that an occupier might, in certain circumstances, be liable forsomething done or omitted to be done on his premises by an independent contractor if he did not take reasonable steps to satisfyhimself that the contractor was competent and that the work was being properly done.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Lord Keith then referred to special circumstances in which the occupier may be held liable,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â <b><u>It</u></b> <b><u>would not ordinarily be reasonable to expect an occupier of</u></b><b><u> </u></b><b><u>premises having engaged a contractor whom he has reasonable grounds</u></b><b><u> </u></b><b><u>for regarding as competent, to</u></b><b><u>supervise</u></b> <b><u>the contractorâs activities in order to ensure that he was discharging his duty to his employees to observe a safe system of work.</u></b><b><u> </u></b><b><u> In special circumstances, on the other hand, where the occupier knows or has reason to suspect that the contractor is using an</u></b> <b><u>unsafe system of work, it</u></b> <b><u>might well be reasonable</u></b> <b><u>for the occupier to take steps to see that the system was made safe.</u></b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The crux of the present case therefore, is whether the council knew or had reason to suspect that Mr. Spence, in contravention ofthe terms of his contract, was bringing in cowboy operators who would proceed to demolish the building in a thoroughly unsafe way.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Lord Oliver of Aylmerton at page 1562 stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â It is possible to envisage circumstances in which an occupier of property engaging the services of an independent contractor tocarry out work on his premises may, as a result of his state of knowledge and opportunities of supervision, render himself liableto an employee of the contractor who is injured as a result of the defective system of work adopted by the employer.

He further held at page 1563 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â ......There can, no doubt, be cases in which an independent contractor does work on premises which result in such premises becomingunsafe for a lawful visitor coming upon them, as when a brick falls from a building under repair onto the head of a postman deliveringthe mail.  In such circumstances the occupier may be held liable to the postman, though in considering whether he is in breach ofthe common duty of care there would have to be considered, inter alia, the circumstances specified in section 2(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Act.  But if I ask myself, in relation to the facts of the present case, whether it can be said that Mr. Fergusonâs injuryarose from a failure by the council to take reasonable care to see that persons in his position would be reasonably safe <i>in using the premises</i> for the relevant purposes, the answer must, I think, be no.  There is no question as, I see it, of Mr. Fergusonâs injury arisingfrom any such failure; for it arose not from his use of the premises but from the manner in which he carried out his work on thepremises.  For this simple reason, I do not consider that the Occupiersâ Liability Act 1957 has anything to do with the presentcase.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">I wish to add that I do not, with all respect, subscribe to the opinion that the mere fact that an occupier may know or have reasonto suspect that the contractor carrying out work on his building may be using an unsafe system of work can of itself be enough toimpose upon him a liability under the Occupiersâ Liability Act 1957, or indeed in negligence at common law, to an employee of thecontractor who is thereby injured, even if the effect of using that unsafe system is to render the premises unsafe and thereby tocause the injury to the employee.  I have only to think of the ordinary householder who calls in an electrician; and the electriciansends in a man who, using an unsafe system established by his employer, creates a danger in the premises which results in his sufferinginjury from burns.  I cannot see that, in ordinary circumstances, the householder should be held liable under the Occupiersâ LiabilityAct 1957, or even in negligence, for failing to tell the man how he should be doing his work.  I recognise that there may be specialcircumstances which may render another person liable to the injured man together with his employer, as when they are, for some reason,joint tortfeasors; but such a situation appears to me to be quite different.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b>Makepeace v.

However, it is not necessary,for the purpose of this appeal, to decide whether the present case falls outside the âoccupancy dutyâ of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and therefore did not engage the <i>Ordinance</i>.  It is also not necessary to decide, whether based on the distinction between âoccupancy dutyâ and âactivity dutyâ, whatLord Keith regarded to be the special circumstances where a liability is to be attached to the occupier must necessarily be outsidethe scope of the âoccupancy dutyâ.  The distinction of these two types of duty obviously was canvassed before the House of Lords,yet Lord Keith did not specifically state that the âspecial circumstancesâ must be considered in the context of a claim basedon negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Negligence was established</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In my view negligence was established against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  The plaintiff had pleaded that the accident was caused by the negligence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, its servants or agents.  The relevant particulars on negligence were :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(k)   Failed to devise a safe system of work;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(l)     Failed to ensure that all apparatus used for the manual handling task were in proper working order and suitable for the purposeused.  The pallet truck and roller trolley were unsuitable and unsafe equipment in that the unit could not be held stable by 2 men. In order to raise the level of the forks of the pallet truck to a suitable height, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to place a piece of wood on each fork which destablilised the unit;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(m)     By its employee, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, failed to ensure that the unit was safely and securely positioned on the pallet truck before operating the same;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(n)   By its employee, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant failed to have any or any adequate regard to the stability and centre of gravity of the unit before attempting to raisethe same on the pallet truck;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(o)   By its employee, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, failed to ensure that the cloth used to cushion the unit whilst it was positioned on the roller bearing trolley was keptaway from the rotating wheels of the trolley.  The unit might have started toppling over when the cloth became caught in the rotatingrollers;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(p)   Failed to supervise the Plaintiff to ensure that he was able to carry out his work in safety;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(q)   Failed to have any or any adequate regard to the Plaintiff and exposed him unnecessarily to a risk of injury;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(r)    In the circumstances, failed to take reasonable care to see that the Plaintiff would be reasonably safe whilst working at itspremises.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In essence the plaintiffâs case is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had failed to take reasonable care to ensure that he would reasonably be safe whilst working at its factory.  It had lentor allowed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff to use the equipment to carry out the repair which were unsuitable and unsafe.  It was aware of the dangeroussituation that arose when such equipment was used.  The plaintiff had, of course, not pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had failed to instruct a competent contractor to carry out the work.  This is understandable because of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs previous position regarding the employment status of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff.  However, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to rely on such a plea.  As a matter of fact, at thetrial the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had attempted to absolve liability by relying on the use of an independent contractor and its lack of control over hiswork. </p>    <p class="heading"><b>Duty of care</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Even proceeding on the basis that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had engaged a contractor whom it had reasonable grounds for regarding as competent, liability against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had been established.  The issue ultimately is whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The editors of <i>Charlesworth &amp; Perry on Negligence</i> (11<sup>th</sup> Ed) at Chapter 2 discussed the development of duty of care from its early inception in <i>Heaven v.

First, the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were foreseeable because of thedangerous operation.  Second, there was the requisite proximity between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the plaintiff who was lawfully on its premises.  Third, it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant because it had allowed and did not stop the dangerous event to take place on its premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Foreseeability of damage</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  First, damage is clearly foreseeable due to the dangerous method used in the removal of the unit.  The Judge found that the methodof transporting the unit was extremely dangerous to the knowledge of the 2<sup>nd </sup>defendant who had provided the equipment for the transportation :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â 54.   However, it cannot be disputed that that system of transporting the calendering unit was done not only with the knowledgeof the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as is shown in the evidence of Ip that on previous occasions he had seen a similar mode of transportation used for thecalendering unit by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  It was also done with the assistance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant since the equipment for such transportation was provided by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, namely the pallet jacks and the bearing trolley.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">55.     Not only that, but also Ip did at the time, or even before this accident occurred, realized that such transportation employedby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in his words âextremely dangerousâ.  Nevertheless, he still allowed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to continue such a system of transportation without so much as a caution or warning let alone preventing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant from continuing with such unsafe system.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">56.    In short the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had permitted an unsafe system of transportation to be carried out in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs factory and which he knew or ought to have known would be dangerous either to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs workers, or for that matter, any of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs own workers who may come close to the calendering unit when being transported in this way, all of those persons beingâvisitorsâ as defined by the Ordinance and to whom a duty is owed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In summary the Judge held that</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â 59. â¦â¦That unsafe system of transportation was clear to anyone and everyone who was there to see it to realize that it wasan unsafe system as was made clear from the evidence of Ip.  Moreover, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had a hand in that unsafe system in that it had supplied the equipment and therefore had assisted in perpetrating thatunsafe system of transportation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  These are findings that the Judge was clearly entitled to make from the evidence adduced before him. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Proximity of relationship</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had participated in creating the dangerous situation by lending the equipment that was used in the removal operation. It was aware of the danger involved by the use of the equipment and it could easily have put a stop to the operation.  There clearlywas a proximity of relationship between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Just, fair and reasonableness</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In this connection, I find Lord Browne-Wilkinsonâs statement in <i>Barrett v. Enfield London Borough Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20AC%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 AC 550</a> gives the best practical guidance on how this matter should be approach,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particularclass of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holdingsuch class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action inrespect of the loss they have individually suffered. â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Based on the unique facts disclosed in this case, I cannot see any detriment to the public interest if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was to be held liable for the injuries of the plaintiff. The case is different from situations in <i>Ferguson</i>, <i>Makepeace</i> or <i>Fairchild</i> where the occupiers had engaged competent contractors and were not aware of the risks that the injured persons were exposed to. Here the specific finding was that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was well aware of the extremely dangerous method of work that the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant were engaged in by using the equipment that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had lent them.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was in a position to stop it but had not chosen to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Bottomley</u></b> <u>adopted the same approach</u></p>    <p>57.  In fact Brooke LJ in <i>Bottomley</i> adopted the three criteria approach when he found liability against the Cricket Club.  He held that</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â If this result is tested by applying the range of tests for identifying a legal duty of care which the House of Lords has developedin the years that followed Ferguson v Welsh, the result is in my judgment the same.  The injuries suffered by Mr Bottomley were foreseeableif there was no proper safety plan: there was the requisite proximity between the club and Mr Bottomley, who was lawfully on theirpremises that evening; and it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the club because it did not do what it ought tohave done before it allowed this dangerous event to take place on its land.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I have no hesitation in finding that liability was established against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant based on well established principles.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Respondentâs notice</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  While the Judgeâs decision against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under paragraphs 62 and 63 of his judgment was said to be based on the breach of common duty of care by an occupier, hisreasoning is equally applicable to that based on negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The plaintiff had issued a respondentâs notice to affirm the judgment by relying on a claim based on joint tortfeasor.  In myview even without a specific plea that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a joint tortfeasor, the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded a case of negligence against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the facts supported the claim.  This is a case where the facts speak louder than the labels.  Based on the evidenceadduced in this case, I would, in any event, allow the plaintiff to rely on the respondentâs notice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Special circumstances</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I would also, in so far as necessary, find that liability can be established based on the âspecial circumstancesâ test propoundedby Lord Keith in <i>Ferguson</i>, namely, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant knew or had reason to suspect that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was using an unsafe system of work, it was reasonable for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to take steps to see that the system was made safe and it had failed to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I would dismiss the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs appeal with costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p><b>Hon Stone J :</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>     I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of the Vice President and of Cheung JA.  I regret that I am unableto share the majority view that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is to be held liable for this accident, and thus for the injuries consequently suffered by the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>     With respect, it seems to me that such finding of liability necessarily would result in an unwarranted extension of establishedprinciple, notwithstanding the attractive consequence that the plaintiff thus would be able to effect a recovery otherwise deniedhim by the circumstances of the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, his employer and tortfeasor, whom we are told now has had default judgment entered against him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>     The essential facts of this case are tolerably straightforward.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>     The plaintiff was an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contractor.  He was instructed to present himself at the premises of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and to participate in the reinstallation of a calendering unit, which needed to be re-attached to the main stentering machine.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>     Apparently this was a procedure which had occurred on several occasions prior to the date of the accident, and when the desiredreattachment had been achieved without mishap by fundamentally the like modus operandi as was used in this instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>     On this occasion, however, something went wrong.  We do not know precisely why this happened, although I suspect that the presenceof two loose pieces of wood apparently placed upon the forks of the second pallet jack had something to do with the imbalance andconsequent toppling of the calendering unit, which seems to have had a high centre of gravity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>     Be that as it may.  Liability for this regrettable occurrence now has been held to accrue to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, in whose premises the accident occurred, and who had retained the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, qua independent contractor, to do this particular job.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>     As I am in the minority, my views are of no immediate consequence in terms of the result of this appeal, but for my part I failto understand why in principle the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should also be held liable as joint tortfeasor for this accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>     It is said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is liable under the provisions of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a></i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>     I am unable to agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>     True it is that as a matter purely of physical fact the accident took place within the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs factory, but that is as far as it goes. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>     I perceive no good reason why this occurrence is anything to do with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs statutory responsibilities, qua occupier, under that Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>     The accident as occurred had nothing to do with the premises themselves, which represented no more than the physical settingfor this accident, which transpired not by reason of the use of the premises but from the manner in which the work in question wascarried out upon those premises; as Mr Godfrey Lam SC, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, neatly summed up the position, in these circumstances the invocation of the <i>Occupiersâ Liability Ordinance</i> is and can be no more than a âred herringâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>     Alternatively it is said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is liable to the plaintiff in common law negligence, which as I understand the position represents the view of the majorityof this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>     With respect, once again I find myself unable to agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was an independent contractor.  He was retained to do the job in question, precisely as he had been retained before, albeiton these earlier occasions happily with no adverse consequence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>     As previously had occurred, the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant apparently had employed a trolley and a pallet jack to effect the required procedure.  We are told that the trolley at leastwas available in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs factory, and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant knew of its use for this purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>     It is trite law that use of an independent contractor precludes vicarious liability ensuring to the person who retained the servicesof such contractor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>     Therefore, unless this was one of those tasks which is regarded by law as intrinsically ânon-delegableâ, in other words byits very nature to be so dangerous or risky that delegation of its performance to an independent contractor â and thus protectionagainst vicarious liability â is not to be permitted, the fault of such contractor, if fault there be, does not permeate throughto the party which retains that contractor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>     It is clear that this particular task to be performed on the occasion in question was not a task which fell within the realmof being âintrinsically non-delegableâ; no doubt it had to be performed with due care and attention, but in itself this taskis far from extraordinary, and seems to be well within the realm of normal delegability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>     Why, therefore, should the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant factory owner now be held liable at common law?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>     The answer to this question appears to lie in the proposition that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant knowingly had permitted his chattel(s) to be used in an âobviously dangerousâ way, and thus that use thereof by the1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant independent contractor is insufficient to negate liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the injured plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>     In this context reliance is placed upon certain cross-examination evidence that an employee and supervisor of the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, a certain Mr. Ip, who was not present at the time of the accident, had opined that in his view the procedure was âdangerousâor âextremely unsafeâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>     Of course it turned out to be unsafe as matters transpired, and in light of the accident as occurred it would have been surprisinghad this particular employee seen fit not to express this view; I dare say that had he been asked for his opinion of this reconnectingoperation at the time when it had been successfully performed, as it had been in the past, it is most improbable that Mr. Ip wouldhave expressed the same view.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>     In any event, I do not regard this subjective post-facto opinion of Mr. Ip as anything to the immediate point.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>     The test for that which is to be classified dangerous can and must be objective: liability in this or indeed in any other casecannot depend upon the random âpost-event perceptionâ of any particular individual â in this case a non-expert employee ofthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant â who ventured this incidental opinion in the course of his cross-examination at the trial below. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>     I note, also, that there was no expert evidence on this issue.  In any event, I am unable to imagine how an operation of thisnature could be conducted without some use of a trolley (or trolleys) and pallet jack (or jacks).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>     Nor was it pleaded in this case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant factory owner failed to ensure that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contractor was competent to do this task.  Once again, this is unsurprising, given that this particular operation of separatingthis calendering unit from and reconnecting it to the âmother machineâ had been successfully performed on several previous occasions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>     Accordingly (and whether pleaded or not) it seems to me that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant was competent to do the job â or, putting it at its lowest, that he had had no reasonable grounds to believe that thecontractor was not so competent â and as a matter of general principle I do not understand the law to be that an employer of anindependent contractor, whom he reasonably (or not unreasonably) regards as competent, has any duty either to supervise the contractorâsactivities and performance of that job, or any independent duty to ensure that the contractor is conforming to that contractorâsown personal duty to his employee(s) to provide a safe system of work. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>     Save in the obvious ânon delegableâ cases, this is precisely the reason that the retention of an independent contractor sufficesto preclude liability on the part of the person, in this instance the factory owner, from being attracted into the potential âliabilitynetâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>     If this analysis be correct, as I believe that it is, that must be an end of the matter, however unfortunate for the injuredplaintiff, who regrettably may wind up with an empty judgment against his 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant employer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>     What then of the argument that in normal course the employer of the independent contractor does have a duty in law to overseeand to âvetâ the working procedure of the independent contractor and his workmen, and that in failing so to do he renders himselfa joint tortfeasor with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>     On the particular facts of this case I emphasize that I do not consider that at the relevant time the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had any reasonable reason to believe that an unsafe system of work was in operation, but even were this to have been so,I have difficulty with the proposition that thereby it would be incumbent upon the employer of the independent contractor to intervenewith that independent contractorâs work in order to ensure adoption of such a safe system of work as that employer perceived âsafeâor otherwise appropriate, and it seems to me not to matter whether this argument is said to arise under the provisions of the OccupiersâLiability Act or under the principles of common law negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>     In this context I respectfully adopt and agree with the observations of Lord Goff in <i>Ferguson v Welsh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20WLR%201553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 WLR 1553</a>, who, after concluding that the Occupiersâ Liability Act 1957 had anything to do with the facts of that particular case (demolitionwork on a building) went on to observe (at 1563A-D):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â I wish to add that I do not, with all respect, subscribe to the opinion that the mere fact that an occupier may know or have reasonto suspect that the contractor carrying out the work on his building may be using an unsafe system of work can of itself be enoughto impose upon him a liability under the Occupiersâ Liability Act 1957, or indeed in negligence at common law, to an employee ofa contractor who is thereby injured, even if the effect of using that unsafe system is to render the premises unsafe and therebyto cause injury to the employee.  I have only to think of an ordinary householder who calls in an electrician; and the electriciansends in a man who, using an unsafe system established by the employer, creates a danger in the premises which results in his sufferingan injury from burns.  I cannot see that, in ordinary circumstances, the householder should be held liable under the OccupiersâLiability Act 1957, or even in negligence, for failing to tell the man how he should be doing his work.  I recognize that there maybe special circumstances which may render another person liable to the injured man together with his employer, as when they are,for some reason, joint tortfeasors; but such a situation appears to me to be quite different.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In <i>Ferguson</i>, op cit., Lord Goff was of course making his comments against the factual backdrop of the potential application of the OccupiersâLiability Act and of the premises in question being made unsafe by the demolition work in question; it strikes me that the positionmust be a fortiori on the facts of the instant case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>    Accordingly, I do not consider that any such argument would be sufficient to get the plaintiff home in terms of liability either.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>    It follows from the foregoing that in this case I am unable to discern any basis for formulating any sustainable finding in negligenceagainst the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, and thus rendering him a joint tortfeasor with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, however inviting it may be to create a situation in which the injured plaintiff is able obtain the adjudged recompensefor his injuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>    In my view, as a matter of policy and principle our law does not make, nor indeed does it seek to make, the employer of an independentcontractor effectively the insurer of that contractor should anything go amiss in the performance of a normally delegable task whichthat contractor is retained to carry out, and, if this be correct, it follows that, with respect, the majority conclusion that liabilityto the plaintiff thus can be founded against his employer, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, is not one to which I feel able to subscribe.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>    For the foregoing reasons, I would have been minded to allow the appeal of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, with costs to the appellant both here and below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Hon Tang VP :</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>    By a majority the appeal is dismissed with costs <i>nisi</i> to the plaintiff both here and below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Robert Tang)<br />                Vice-President</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)<br />                Justice of Appeal</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(William Stone)<br />                Judge of the Court of First Instance</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Neville Sarony, QC SC &amp; Mr. Y.
