Mr Tollan relied onpara 6(6) of the Amended Defence of the 1st Defendant which referred to the 2nd defendant.  Para 6(6) of the Amended Defence of the1st defendant pleaded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(6) The partners of the 1st Defendant are independent and separate from Grant Thornton International Limited, the 2nd Defendantcompany. The 2nd Defendant is a non-profit making umbrella organisation that co-ordinates and regulates global firm standards forits member firms, all of which are independent accountancy firms that practise in their respective countries under the name GrantThornton. The 1st Defendant is one such firm, which is locally owned, operated and managed in Hong Kong. The 1st Defendant and 2ndDefendant are not in a partnership or an agency relationship. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Tollan also referred to the Statement of Claim and said that the sole cause of action against the 2nd defendant is vicariousliability for the acts of Mr Azedo and that is based on the allegations in para 35 of the Statement of Claim as referred to above. He highlighted the lack of particulars for these allegations.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Tollan then repeated that the 2nd defendant is a not-for-profit, non-practising, international umbrella membership entity andorganised as a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales.  It does not provide services to clients andit has no clients.  The member firms, including the 1st defendant, are independently owned and managed around the world which provideaccounting, tax and specialist business advice to private businesses and public entities.  Mr Azedo was the 1st defendantâs managingpartner until 31 March 2008 and his consultancy agreement with the 1st defendant also ended on 30 September 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Tollan also said that between late 2005 to 12 October 2009, Mr Azedo was a member of the Global Leadership Board at the 2nd defendant. His latest title was âGlobal Leader â Member Firm Networkâ.  In this role, he was responsible for managing the relationshipbetween the 2nd defendant and its member firms.  Mr Tollan learnt from the 2nd defendantâs Chief Legal Counsel, a Mr Kehoe thatthe scope of Mr Azedoâs duties in this role was solely business development of member firms and handling certain member firm issues. His role did not extend to any services involving the giving of any accounting or other associated advice either to the member firmsor clients.  Mr Azedo provided services to the 2nd defendant on the basis of a temporary secondment from the 1st defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Tollan also said that there is no evidence on which the particulars in para 35 of the Statement of Claim can be made out. Hence,the plaintiff did not have a good cause of action against the 2nd defendant.  He also referred to the statements issued under the2nd defendantâs letterhead as referred to in para 23(iii) of the Statement of Claim. He said that they cannot establish a causeaction and are irrelevant.</p>    <p class="heading">The 2nd Defendantâs allegations of material non-disclosure</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Tollan then alleged that the plaintiff had committed a number of material non-disclosures in her application for leave to issuea concurrent writ and to serve the same on the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Before going into these allegations, I would refer to <i>Wo Fung Paper Making Factory Ltd v Sappi Kraft (Pty) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 346</a> for Hunter JAâs observations at 356I to 357J on applications under Orders 11 and 12 and material non-disclosure:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(5) There are two stages to the enquiry. The first is the <i>ex parte</i> stage under Order 11. I emphasise that it is <i>ex parte</i> on documents. The practice does not envisage oral submissions ever being made except at specific request. Order 11, rule 4(1) specifieswhat the supporting affidavit has to show. At that stage it seems to me that the court has to come to a provisional view (it beingan <i>ex parte</i> application) on three matters. The first is whether the applicant shows a <i>prima facie</i> case. I read the speeches in <i>Vitkovice</i>as accepting that that is the burden of that stage, it may be for the simple reason that when the court has only got one party's versionbefore it, it can do very little more. That is how I read the speeches of Lord Simonds at p. 876, Lord Radcliffe at p. 884, LordTucker at p. 891. Secondly, it has to consider the sufficiency in law of the facts alleged: for example whether the applicant bringshimself within any of the sub-rules and whether the facts alleged are sufficient <i>prima facie</i> to establish the cause of action alleged. Thirdly, the court has to consider the facts within the limited scope available. This reallycomes down to considering whether the facts are sufficiently asserted in an apparently credible manner. The matter was put in thisway in a case in contract by Lord Buckmaster giving the opinion of the Privy Council in <i>Hemelryck v. William Lyall Shipbuilding</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1921%5d%201%20AC%20698" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1921] 1 AC 698</a> at p. 701. He said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âFor the purpose of exercising the discretion which is conferred by the rules to be exercised [that is Order 11] it is sufficientif there appears reasonable evidence that a contract has been made.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6) The second stage which may or may not be reached, follows a proper application under Order 12, rule 8. Then the court has to considerall the evidence before it, and to determine in the light of that whether the plaintiff shows a good arguable case. That it is thetest laid down in <i>Vitkovice</i>at that stage. But the courtâs position on fact and law is the same as it was at the <i>ex parte</i> stage. It cannot make any findings of fact. It can certainly consider the legal sufficiency of the facts, and whether there are legalholes or obvious failings in the plaintiff's case. It can in the words of Lord Goddard, C.J. in <i>Malik v. National Bank of Czechoslovakia</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%20176%20LT%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 176 LT 136</a> cited in <i>Vitkovice</i>at p. 888, âif it can see by what appears on the affidavits that the case put up is a perfectly groundless one and one in whichthere is no substance at all, the court can refuse to give leaveâ. Similarly if the case is demurrable or nearly so. But that isabout the limit of the courtâs power and function on disputed facts under this jurisdiction. It follows that the existence of disputedfacts is normally quite irrelevant to the question as to whether or not a good arguable case has been shown. Putting it in anotherway, the showing of a good arguable case does not postulate an Order 14 case, and is not negatived by the fact that good arguabledefences may exist. The relevance of the dispute goes really to little more than the question of the suitability of the forum evidentiallyand it may be a factor to be brought in there. Otherwise normally speaking factual disputes are quite irrelevant.</p>        <p class="quote">I turn now to the two principles I conceive to be relevant, in relation to non-disclosure. First the court's power to discharge anyorder obtained <i>ex parte</i> for material non-disclosure is salutary and necessary. As one of the earlier cases shows, <i>ex parte Polignac</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%201%20KB%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] 1 KB 486</a>, it is there for the courtâs own protection. It is necessary to prevent its processes being abused. Secondly, there is anotherequally significant principle in this jurisdiction. This is to make sure that the court does not get itself in a position of whatmight be called âcounter-abuseâ: where this sort of point is regarded by litigants as âa very present help in troubleâ; andwhere problems arise on the substance to resort to attack as the best method of defence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The first allegation of material non-disclosure is the plaintiffâs failure to distinguish between the 2nd defendantâs activitiesas a global coordinating entity and the services provided by member firms like the 1st defendant.  Mr Tollan referred to the plaintiffâsreference to the 2nd defendant as an âumbrellaâ entity.  He criticized the reference as an insufficient explanation to the courtof the role of the 2nd defendant and it did not explain that the 2nd defendant did not have a client facing operation.  There is,however, nothing that demonstrates the plaintiffâs awareness of the nature and role of the 2nd defendant.  She in fact said shehad no knowledge of those matters in her reply affidavit.  I do not think she can be criticised for not disclosing something thatshe did not know. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The second allegation is the plaintiffâs failure to disclose that she had never been provided by the 1st or 2nd defendant anydocumentation like engagement letter, invoices for service or report showing that they had been engaged by her to provide professionalservices.  This, I think, is more a defence argument than a matter that should have been disclosed by the plaintiff.  The lack ofsuch documentation alone cannot defeat the plaintiffâs claim against either defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The third allegation is the plaintiffâs failure to explain how the plaintiff could have believed that âinvestment advisory ortrustee servicesâ was within Mr Azedoâs title of âGlobal Leader â Member Firm Developmentâ of the 2nd defendant and theduties thereof.  However, there is again no evidence showing that the plaintiff was aware of Mr Azedoâs duties in his role withthe 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The next allegation is the plaintiffâs failure to identify the alleged irregularities in the statements purportedly issued bythe 2nd defendant to her.  Mr Tollan said these were hallmarks of falsity that should have been disclosed to the court.  I againconsider this more an argument for the defence than a matter that should have disclosed by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff has alsosaid in her reply affidavit that she was not aware of the irregularities.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Tollan also referred to the fact that for the 10-year period covered by the alleged services of the 1st and 2nd defendants, thestatements issued in the first six years did not bear any mark of either defendant and that suggested that it was Mr Azedo who servedthe plaintiff in his personal capacity.  This, I think, is again a defence argument.  There are statements purportedly issued bythe 1st and 2nd defendants in the later years. The plaintiff is also relying on these statements to support her case.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The last allegation is the plaintiffâs failure to disclose that she was a cousin and, until Mr Azedoâs disappearance, a veryclose personal friend of Mr Azedo.  This again is a defence argument.  I do not think its disclosure or otherwise would have affectedthe Masterâs discretion in granting leave.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On the whole, I do not think the 2nd defendant has made out a case of material non-disclosure against the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Submission of the 2nd Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Leading counsel for the 2nd defendant submitted that there is no serious issue to be tried in the claim against the 2nd defendantas the plaintiff has not got a good cause of action against the 2nd defendant.  What the plaintiff has pleaded in para 35 of herstatement of claim is just âritual incantationâ of the rule for establishing vicarious liability and is not enough.  There mustbe evidence to make out the claim. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Regarding the claim based on Mr Azedoâs ordinary course of employment with the 2nd defendant, leading counsel said the plaintiffhas not pleaded any facts to support her case that what Mr Azedo did in relation to her investment money was in the ordinary courseof the employment.  Insofar as it could be discerned from the title of âGlobal Leader â Member Firm Developmentâ, it is difficultto see how his duties in that role could provide the opportunity for the wrongs he did to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Regarding the claim based on the ostensible/apparent authority of the 2nd defendant, the plaintiff has also not pleaded any representationmade or permitted to be made by the 2nd defendant that Mr Azedo had the authority from the 2nd defendant to do what he did that injuredthe plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For the third claim that Mr Azedo acted in close connection with the business or activities of the 2nd defendant, there is againno pleading of nature of Mr Azedoâs employment with the 2nd defendant and how did it have a close connection with what he did thatinjured the plaintiff. From the plaintiffâs affidavit evidence, she did not appear to know about the nature of the 2nd defendantâsactivities.  Hence, her claim of vicarious liability of the 2nd defendant is speculative.</p>    <p class="heading">Submissions of the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Counsel for the plaintiff referred to <i>Ming Ah Insurance (HK) Ltd v Ritz-Carlton Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 569</a> and submitted that the court should apply the âclose connection testâ.  The facts of this case are summarised in the headnoteof report as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTwo pedestrians were seriously injured as a result of Eâs negligent driving of a limousine. E was employed as a doorman by H,a hotel. Part of his duties included acting as a âcar jockeyâ. This involved moving cars, and sometimes limousines, that causedan obstruction in the hotel forecourt. Moving cars sometimes involved taking the car out of the forecourt and along the same routewhere the accident occurred. H hired limousines and their chauffeurs from a third party limousine service. A limousine would be movedonly when its chauffeur was off duty. There developed a practice where employees would leave the hotel premises to collect food,sometimes by taxi, and sometimes by chauffeur-driven limousine. However, car jockeys were not authorised to drive limousines forthe specific purpose of collecting food. The accident occurred when E, using keys left in his custody by an off-duty chauffeur, drovea bellboy in a limousine to collect food.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Court of Final Appeal held against the hotel on vicarious liability that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)     An employer was vicariously liable for an employee's unauthorised tortious act, if the employeeâs tort was so closelyconnected with his employment that it would be fair and just to hold his employer vicariously liable.  This was the âclose connectionâcriterion. It was the basic criterion for all cases of tort committed by an employee while engaged in an unauthorised act for hisemployer, whether the tort involved intentional wrongdoing or mere inadvertence.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)       Courts should openly confront the question of whether liability should lie against the employer, rather than obscuring thedecision beneath semantic discussions of âscope of employmentâ and âmode of conductâ.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)       The concept of employment must be viewed broadly when applying the âclose connectionâ criterion.  The nature of theemployment was not to be ascertained merely by attempting to tabulate the employee's duties.  It was necessary to stand back andsee how the employer's activities were actually carried out and how that exposed the public to the risk of tortious harm caused bythe employee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Counsel further submitted that on the âclose connectionâ test, unless the 2nd defendant can conclusively show that Mr Azedohad no representative, agent or employment connection with the 2nd defendant, then there are serious issues to be tried in the plaintiffâsclaim for vicarious liability.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Counsel further submitted that the 2nd defendant is a necessary and proper party in the action as the 1st defendant denies liabilityafter 1 April 2008 on the ground that Mr Azedo had left its employment on that day, therefore there is an issue of for whom Mr Azedowas working from 1 April 2008. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Counsel also referred to the statements issued under the 2nd defendantâs letterhead to the plaintiff in support of the plaintiffâsclaim against the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Counsel further referred to the judgment of Recorder B Yu, SC in <i>Ren Yun Liang &amp; Ors v China Merchants Bank</i>, HCA 1456/2005 at para 32 that the threshold for the defendant to show that there is no serious question to be tried is high.  Itwould be necessary for the defendant to demonstrate that the Statement of Claim ought to be struck out against the defendant on thegrounds in O.18 r.19 of the Rules of the High Court.  Counsel also submitted that the Statement of Claim herein as against the 2nddefendant can survive a notional striking out.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Counsel also referred to <i>Mega v Archbishop of Birmingham &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%201%20WLR%201441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] 1 WLR 1441</a> where the English Court of Appeal upheld the claimantâs claim of vicarious liability against the defendant.  The facts of the caseare also summarised in the headnote as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe claimant, who had learning difficulties and epilepsy, brought a claim against a Roman Catholic archdiocese for damages forpersonal injuries, alleging that he had been sexually abused as a child some 30 years earlier by a priest who lived and worked inthe archdiocese. The claimant was not a Roman Catholic but had met the priest, who had special responsibility for youth work, throughchurch discos which were open to all young people, and had done jobs for the priest, including in the presbytery where the priestlived and where some of the alleged abuse had taken place. â¦ In its defence the archdiocese â¦ denied â¦ vicarious liabilityfor the priestâs acts, although it admitted, for the purposes of the action only, that the priest had been an employee of the archdiocese.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury MR said in paras 43-48 and 52-53:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â43 Although I acknowledge the issue is not easy to resolve, I have reached a different conclusion from the judge. â¦, the issue,although very much fact-dependent, is ultimately one of law rather than of inference from facts, and at least in this case, the judgehad no particular advantage over this court by his having seen live witnesses. Further, I consider that there is force in Ms Gumbelâsargument that the judge appears to have erred in principle by focusing on the actual motives of Father Clonan, and placing too muchemphasis on the acts of abuse themselves.</p>        <p class="quote">44. The torfeasor was a Roman Catholic priest, and the claimant was not a Roman Catholic, and at no time had anything to do with thechurch itself (other than doing some cleaning work in the church once, which I regard as an irrelevant isolated incident). To thatextent, the claimantâs case is clearly weaker than, or at least distinguishable from, that of the successful claimant in <i>Listerâs</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 215</a>, or of a Roman Catholic boy, such as M, who worked as an altar server at the church and was abused by Father Clonan. However, thereare a number of factors, which, when taken together, persuade me that there was a sufficiently close connection between Father Clonanâsemployment as priest at the church and the abuse which he inflicted on the claimant to render it fair and just to impose vicariousliability for the abuse on his employer, the archdiocese.</p>        <p class="quote">45. First, Father Clonan was normally dressed in clerical garb, and was so dressed, when he first met the claimant. At the very least,this factor at least sets the scene. A priest has a special role, which involves trust and responsibility in a more general way eventhan a teacher, a doctor, or a nurse. He is in a sense, never off duty; thus, he will normally be dressed in âuniformâ in publicand not just when at his place of work. So, too, he has a degree of general moral authority which no other role enjoys; hence thetitle of âFather Chrisâ, by which Father Colonan was habitually known. <i>It was his employment as a priest by the archdiocese which enabled him, indeed was intended to enable him, to hold himself out ashaving such a role and such authority.</i></p>        <p class="quote">46. Secondly, Father Clonanâs functions as a priest included a duty to evangelise, or âto bring the gospel to be known to otherpeople â¦ Roman Catholics and non-Roman Catholicsâ to quote from the evidence of Monsignor Moran. As a result he was, as MonsignorMoran also accepted, âobliged to befriend non-Roman Catholicsâ, and âto gain and be worthy of their trustâ. <i>Accordingly, he was ostensibly performing his duty as a priest employed by the archdiocese by getting to know the claimant.</i> The fact that he was getting to know the claimant for nefarious reasons is not really in point, any more than it assisted the schoolin <i>Listerâs</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 215</a> that the warden may have been âgroomingâ the claimant in that case: <i>Father Clonan developed his relationship with the claimant under the cloak, or guise, of performing his pastoral duties.</i></p>        <p class="quote">47. Thirdly, given that the claimant was aged 12 or 13 when his association with Father Clonan started, it is significant that FatherClonan was given a special responsibility for youth work at the church. It underlines the point that, when getting to know, wheneffectively âgroomingâ, the claimant, <i>Father Clonan was ostensibly carrying out one of his specifically assigned functions in the church.</i></p>        <p class="quote">48. Fourthly, Father Clonan was able to develop, and did develop, his relationship with the claimant by inviting him to a disco whichwas on church premises and which he organised as a priest at the church. <i>Thus, the claimant was drawn in to the relationship through the medium of a church-organised function carried on in church premisesby Father Clonan, a priest at the church.</i> Fifthly, the relationship was further developed by Father Clonan getting the claimant to help clear up after discos. There is noevidence that the claimant was paid for this work, but it does appear that this work, on church premises at the request of a priestat the church, led to the claimant doing other work for Father Clonan. <i>Thus, Father Clonanâs role as priest in the archdiocese gave him the status and opportunity to draw the claimant further into hissexually abusive orbit by ostensibly respectable means connected with his employment as a priest at the church.</i></p>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>        <p class="quote">52. I accept that the court should not be too ready to impose vicarious liability on a defendant. It is, after all, a type of liabilityfor tort which involves no fault on the part of the defendant, and for that reason alone its application should be reasonably circumscribed.Further and more specifically, the deleterious effect on schools, and charities and social clubs aimed at the young, of too readilyimposing such liability on employers for sexual abuse of children by their employees was rightly identified by the Canadian SupremeCourt in <i>Jacobiâs</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=174%20DLR%20%284th%29%2071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">174 DLR (4th) 71</a>, para 30. Thus, as emphasised in that case, the fact that the opportunity to commit abuse arises, as a result of the employment isnot enough (paras 53-56), but, as I have sought to explain, there was much more here.</p>        <p class="quote">53. In <i>Jacobiâs</i> case, a para.79, the Canadian Supreme Court suggested that, in order to establish vicarious liability, <i>a claimant must show that there was âa material increase in the risk of harm occurring in the sense that the employment significantlycontributed to the occurrence of the harmâ</i>. It appears to me, for the reasons given, that requirement is satisfied.â (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Analyses and decision</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The plaintiffâs case against the 1st defendant is built on paras. 9 and 10 of the Statement of Claim.  Para 9 pleads that in around1999, Mr Azedo advised the plaintiff that she should protect her wealth by placing her money with the 1st defendant for the 1st defendantto manage and invest on her behalf.  She did not say that her money was to be placed with Mr Azedo personally but it was to be placedwith the 1st defendant.  In para 10, she pleaded that she had accepted Mr Azedoâs advice and agreed to allow Mr Azedo, as the 1stdefendantâs managing partner to manage and invest her money.  Again, she allowed the management and investment of her money bythe 1st defendant through Mr Azedo as its managing partner and not by Mr Azedo personally. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It is her case against the 1st defendant that all along Mr Azedo was purportedly acting as the agent of the 1st defendant in hisdealings with her in relation to her investment money.  However, she did not plead how, when Mr Azedo ceased to be employed by the1st defendant and began to be employed by the 2nd defendant, the role of the 1st defendant (which was a contractual one) in managingand investing her money was taken up by the 2nd defendant.  This is a gap in her case of how the 2nd defendant had become vicariouslyliable for the loss of her investment money.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  She also did not know the nature of the 2nd defendantâs activities save what she has pleaded in para 5(ii) of the Statement ofClaim.  She pleaded in this paragraph that the 2nd defendant is an international umbrella entity of a renowned global organisationof accounting and consulting member firms providing tax, corporate business, financial and other specialist advice.  She has notchallenged Mr Tollanâs evidence that the 2nd defendant is a private company limited by guarantee and is a not-for-profit, non-practising,international umbrella entity which does not provide services to clients and has no clients.  Given the nature of the 2nd defendantâsactivities and Mr Azedo being its âGlobal Leader â Member Firm Developmentâ, I cannot see how Mr Azedoâs dealings with theplaintiffâs investment money can be said to be in the ordinary course of his employment with the 2nd Defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Though Mr Azedoâs employment with the 1st Defendant ceased on 31 March 2008, his fraud on the plaintiff continued.  However, itdoes not mean that there had to be another purported principal of Mr Azedo so as to facilitate the continuation of the claim of vicariousliability.  I do not think the 2nd defendant is a necessary or proper party in this action for this reason alone.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The plaintiffâs next claim of vicarious liability against the 2nd defendant is that Mr Azedo, in committing his acts of fraud,was acting with the ostensible/apparent authority of the 2nd defendant.  However, I agree with the submission of leading counselfor the 2nd defendant that the plaintiff has not pleaded any representation made or permitted to be made by the 2nd defendant tothe plaintiff that Mr Azedo had the authority from the 2nd defendant to do what he did in relation to the plaintiffâs investmentmoney.  I also disagree with the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff that it is for the 2nd defendant to prove that Mr Azedohad no representative, agent or employment connection with the 2nd defendant.  That reverses the burden of proof.  This inadequacyin the Statement of Claim is connected to the inadequacy of how the 2nd defendant had assumed the alleged role of the 1st defendantwhen Mr Azedo ceased to be employed by the 1st defendant on 31 March 2008 as pointed out above. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Though there are investment statements under the letterhead of the 2nd defendant issued to the plaintiff, these statements are obviouslyfalse documents created by Mr Azedo to perpetrate his fraud on the plaintiff.  I do not think a fraudsterâs unwarranted representationpurportedly on behalf of the principal can bind the principal.  These statements do not assist the plaintiff in her claim againstthe 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Regarding the close connection test, leading counsel for the 2nd defendant has rightly pointed out that there is no pleading ofthe nature of Mr Azedoâs employment with the 2nd defendant or how did it have a close connection with Mr Azedoâs activities thatinjured the plaintiff. In the light of the nature of the 2nd defendantâs functions and activities, particularly that it has noclient and does not provide service to any client, and Mr Azedoâs employment with it to carry out business development of memberfirms and handling member firm issues which did not extend to any service of giving accounting or associated advice to member firmsor clients, I cannot see any connection between Mr Azedoâs employment with the 2nd defendant and his fraudulent activities in respectof the plaintiffâs investment money. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I also refer to the <i>Mega</i>case.  I cannot see how Mr Azedoâs employment by the 2nd defendant would have enabled Mr Azedo to hold himself out as having a roleand authority on behalf of the 2nd defendant to handle the investment money of the plaintiff as the 2nd defendant has no client anddoes not provide such service to any client.  Mr Azedo was not ostensibly carrying out any of his duties/functions for the 2nd defendantwhen he dealt with the plaintiffâs money.  His employment with the 2nd defendant did not give him any status or opportunity todo so by ostensibly respectable means connected with the employment.  I do not think the plaintiff has shown that Mr Azedoâs employmentwith the 2nd defendant has significantly contributed to the occurrence of the harm occasioned by Mr Azedo to her.  Even if Mr Azedoshould have lied to her about the nature of the 2nd defendantâs functions and/or of his employment with the 2nd defendant, the2nd defendant would still not be affected by such lie.  I therefore do not think the 2nd defendant should be liable for Mr Azedoâsfraudulent acts.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  For the above reasons, I think the plaintiffâs claim against the 2nd defendant cannot survive a notional striking out.  I thereforeset aside:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)              the service of the concurrent writ of summons on the 2nd defendant;</p>        <p>(ii)           the Masterâs order granting leave to issue and serve the concurrent writ on the 2nd defendant; and</p>        <p>(iii)         the writ insofar as it relates to the 2nd defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Since the 2nd defendant has succeeded in this application, I also make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay the 2nd defendantâs costs of this application to be taxed if not agreed. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  On 10 March 2010, the Registrar dismissed the 2nd defendantâs application for the determination of a preliminary issue beforethe remainder of this application is dealt with.  I allowed the 2nd defendantâs appeal against the Registrarâs order on 13 April2010, but left the incidence of the costs before the Registrar to be agreed by the parties or to be determined later. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The hearing on 10 March was mainly for giving directions for the disposal of this application.  That was why the Registrar assessedthe costs for that hearing at HK$800.  The 2nd defendant has succeeded in the appeal against the dismissal of the application fordetermination of a preliminary issue.  It has also succeeded in the application itself.  I therefore make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay the 2nd defendant the HK$800 costs for the hearing before the Registrar.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Though the 2nd defendant succeeded in the application for determination of a preliminary issue, Master Kwang on 23 June 2010 decidedthe preliminary issue against it.  Master Kwang left the question of costs to be decided by me together with the costs of this application.Since the preliminary issue was decided against the 2nd defendant, I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that it should pay the plaintiff the costs for that determination.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Unless there is an application made within the next 14 days for variation of the above costs orders <i>nisi</i>, the parties shall fix a 9:30 a.m. hearing before me for summary assessment of these costs orders and the costs order I made on 13April 2010.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(L.
