"Hinode Maru No. 8" and landed in HongKong on the 14th August 1973 from a lighter and placed in the defendant's godown until the 22nd August 1973 and stored by the defendantbetween those dates for reward. While there the cartons were damaged by rain water in circumstances with which I will deal. The defenceas amended denies negligence but contains an alternative plea to the effect that the plaintiff by his agent Kyosei Agencies (H.K.)Ltd. (to which I will refer as Kyosei Agencies) or alternatively Kyosei Agencies with the consent express or implied of the plaintiffstored the cartons in the defendant's godown pursuant to an agreement between Kyosei Agencies and the defendant that the storagewas subject to the conditions set out on the back of the defendant's current standard form of godown warrant. These conditions ifapplicable provide that the defendant does not accept liability for loss, damage or deficiency caused or contributed to by any ofthe specified causes, whether such loss, damage or deficiency was also in part caused to or contributed to by any neglect, wrongfulact, misfeasance, error of judgment, of the defendants, their servants or agents or other persons for whose acts the defendants mightapart from such provision be liable. The causes so specified included water damage, tempest and typhoon; that the damage in questionwas caused or contributed to by rainfall from tropical storm "Joan" I have no doubt so that the damage to the goods was occasionedby water damage one of the specified causes. A matter for consideration is therefore whether, the water damage was due to the negligenceof the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In their reply the plaintiff denied the existence of any agency between the plaintiff and Kyosei Agencies and denied knowledge ofany agreement between the defendant and Kyosei Agencies or the terms and conditions of any such agreement and claimed that the goodswere stored in the defendant's godown by Kyosei Agencies without the prior knowledge or the implied or express consent or approvalof the plaintiff and denied the applicability of the conditions in question. At the suggestion of the parties and on the agreementof counsel for the defendant that, if negligence was relevant it was for the defendant to rebut its existence, I ruled that it wasfor the defendant to begin. Having considered the admissions in the pleadings and in answer to interrogatories administered by theplaintiff to the defendant and the evidence called by the parties I have arrived at the following conclusions of fact.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In July 1973 the plaintiff purchased the goods in question from a Japanese company. The invoices evidencing this purchase are inthe agreed bundle and show that the goods were to be leaded at the port of Yokohama in Japan. These invoices specify the unit pricefor the goods in Yen and under the column "amount" appears the following entry:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"F.O.B. Japan 3 Yen 2,169,000.50 and 3 Yen 744,724."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">An incomplete copy of the bills of lading appears in the agreed bundle but it is clear that the bills of lading contain the endorsement"freight collect". It is a condition of the bills of lading issued to the vendors in Japan that:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">The goods may be discharged, without notice, as soon as the ship is ready to unload continuously day and night Sundays and holidaysincluded, on to wharf or quay or into warehouse or into bulk lazaretto or left on to any other place and be stored there at the riskand expense of the shippers, consignees or owners of the goods, any a custom of the port to the contrary notwithstanding.

Kyosei Agencies then, following their usual practice,discharged the goods into the defendant's godown. Delivery orders were obtained by agents of the plaintiff and endorsed by the plaintiff.The delivery orders are dated the 16th August 1973 and are described as being "valid until the 21.8.73". The goods when dischargedat the godown were one of a number of consignments regarded by Kyosei Agencies as "general discharge". This was clearly a usual practicefor Kyosei Agencies to follow for as early as the 20th November 1971 Kyosei Agencies had appointed the defendant "as our generaldischarge godown with effective (sic) as from 1st January 1972. We hereby agreed (sic) with your conditions of storage as statedon the reverse side of your godown warrant." The reverse side of that godown warrant contains the exemption which I have mentionedwhen summarising the pleadings. On their discharge the goods were stored on the first floor of the defendant's godown. This is asix-storey building facing Yau Tong Bay looking south-west and Tong Yuen Street looking north-east. On the first floor of this buildingare two loading bays and goods to be stored on the first floor may be admitted to it, having been raised on winches through one oftwo large openings in the front wall of the premises which serve these loading bays. These openings may be closed by large metalsliding doors. These openings look directly onto the sea. There is a corresponding loading bay overlooking Tong Yuen Street but thesliding doors to this bay do not directly overlook Tong Yuen Street but are at right angles to it. The plaintiff's goods which werepacked in 56 cartons were, according to the evidence of the witnesses for the defendant, placed close to the loading bay overlookingthe sea but well away from the metal sliding doors and there was a wall intervening. They were placed between the loading bay anda staircase leading to the second and upper floors of the building and eventually to the roof. The roof is flat and its drainageis adequate to carry away storm water; such water as might enter the premises under the door to the roof one would expect to be carriedaway after passing down a short flight of stairs, by a gulley and a drain on the top floor. There is a similar gulley near the staircaseon each of the other floors. It was the case for the defendant that the rain water which damaged the goods in this particular instancecame down the staircase to which I have referred passing the gulley on the top floor turned right and then right again and continueddown the staircase passing in similar tortuous manner the fifth, fourth and third floors so that it was overflow from the roof thedefendant urges that caused damage to the goods. This I find quite impossible to accept. If the cartons in question were stackedone on top of the other as the defendant's godown manager stated and were more than 20 feet from the stair case all could not havebeen soaked but it is clear from the survey of the damage incurred that every carton was wet.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The manager of the defendant gave evidence as to the precautions to be taken against the danger of damage to goods stored by water.He indicated that there was a set procedure, a set of standing instructions to be implemented by the godown manager when a stormwas imminent. These standing instructions had not been committed to writing but had been passed by him to the manager by word ofmouth. They were to the effect that on the hoisting of No. 1 typhoon danger warning it was the duty of the godown manager to seeto it that all doors and windows on all six floors were secured. The manager in his evidence indicated with considerable particularitythe manner in which the sliding doors should be secured as they were most susceptible to seepage by water. He said that these doorshad to be sealed with a material which would apparently become impermeable if wet. On the hoisting of No. 1 signal a thorough checkwas to be made on the roof to see if any of the drains were choked or if there was any danger of flooding. This witness however hadno personal knowledge as to what took place on the occasion in question; the instructions which he insisted had been given on thisoccasion were of a general nature although he said that he had given instructions "long ago" of a detailed nature. His evidence wasof no assistance as to the precautions which were actually taken although of some guidance as to precautions which should have beentaken in the event of a No. 1 storm signal being hoisted. It is clear however from the evidence of the manager of the defendant'sgodown that on the night in question virtually no precautions against damage by water were taken. He was at the godown on the 20thAugust 1973 but his being there had nothing to do with the storm. He first became aware of the wind and rain outside at about 3.00a.m. on the 21st. (Although the witness referred throughout to the morning of the 20th since his evidence was that the godown wasflooded on the morning of the 20th as a result of a storm which took place on the night of the 19th/20th I took his remarks to beintended to refer to the night of the 20th/21st since it was clear that it was on that night that the storm occurred.) He did nothingto the doors leading to the roof. He did not know whether the caretaker had done so and his evidence that the 56 cartons had beenwet by water coming from the roof was obviously pure speculation. He said he became aware of water entering the godown at about 4.00a.m. He went he said to the roof on two occasions, noticed water had been accumulating and put sacks on the staircase to preventflooding. He was unable to shift cargo which was in danger of becoming wet to a dry spot in the godown because he had no machineryto do so and the goods were so heavy that they could not be shifted manually. He made no use of any substance which might have beenused to make the sliding doors impervious to water. Indeed he did not seem to know of any such substance although the general managerhad described it in detail. I found the evidence of the godown manager and of the caretaker highly unsatisfactory. I was driven byit to the conclusion that their memories of times and dates were faulty, that no protection had been taken against the entry of waterinto the godown other than the placing of sacks on the staircase inside the door to the roof, that there were no question of movinggoods which might be in danger in one place to another place in which they would not be in danger and that there was no labour otherthan the caretaker and the manager himself to move goods. I was not satisfied that the sliding doors to the loading bays on the firstdoor had been closed during the typhoon storm. Even had they been left open, however, I find it difficult to see how the goods couldhave been wet throughout if they were in fact placed where I was told they had been placed for the spot indicated is around a cornerfrom the sliding doors. Assuming then that is for defendant to prove the absence of negligence I must hold that it has not done so. Indeed I am satisfied on the evidence of thedefendant taken as a whole that the wetting of the goods was caused through the negligent omission of the godown manager and of thecaretaker to do anything to safeguard the goods. The godown manager stated unequivocally that he did not know of the approach ofthe storm. He came to know of it when it was already raging. I find as fact that the goods were damaged by rain water as a resultof the negligence of the defendant in that the defendant had failed to take obvious and reasonable steps (outlined by its manager)to prevent such damage and had failed to take steps to see that if goods were in danger they could be shifted to a safe place. Thesystem or its application was obviously deficient.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Bunting for the defendant has conceded that the defendant was bailee of the goods for reward, that the burden was on the defendantto disprove negligence and that the standard of care in question is the ordinary standard of care but I am quite satisfied not onlythat the defendant has failed to displace the accepted onus but that it has been established that the defendant was negligent. Isit in the circumstances possible for the defendant to escape liability by reliance on the conditions on the back of a 1972 godownwarrant incorporated into its agreement with the shipping agency. Since <u>Lee Cooper Ltd.</u> v. <u>C.H. Jeakins &amp; Sons Ltd.</u><sup>(1)</sup> it has been well accepted that the remedy of an owner whose goods are damaged or lost through the negligence of a sub-bailee whoowes no contractual liability to the owner lies in tort. In that case Marshall, J. having called to mind the words of Denning L.J.in <u>Greene</u> v. <u>Chelsea Borough Council</u><sup>(2)</sup> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"During the nineteenth century there was a doctrine current in the law which I will call the 'privity-of-contract' doctrine. In thosedays it was thought that if the defendant became connected with the matter because of a contract he had made, then his obligationswere to be measured by the contract and nothing else. He owed, it was said, no duty of care to anyone who was not a party to thecontract. This doctrine received its quietus by the decision of the House of Lords in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1932%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1932 A.C. 562."</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">went on to say at page 9:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Whilst it may be that there is no previous decision exactly fitting the facts of this case, that is no answer and in Lord Macmillan'swords (in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u>) 'the categories of negligence are never closed'.

Mr. Bunting argues that it is and bases his argument on two grounds. Firstly he argues that there is inthis case what he calls a chain of agency and secondly he on an implied consent by the owner to the "exempting conditions" containedin a contract between the negligent sub-bailee and the bailee from whom he took over possession.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In considering this question on the pleadings the first matter for decision then is whether the relationship of principal and agentexisted between the Kyosei Agencies and the plaintiff and, if so, if the Kyosei Agencies acted within the scope of its authorityso as to bind the plaintiff. It is apparent that the resonsibility of the shipping company (in relation to which Kyosei Agencieswas clearly an agent) ceased as soon as the goods were lifted from the ships deck and that the shipping company was within its rightsin entrusting them to the Kyosei Agencies. So much is clear from the terms of the bill of lading which I have quoted. It was to beanticipated by any reasonable importer of goods that the shipping agency would in due course entrust them to the care of a wharfand godown company. I cannot however see that it is to be inferred from this that the relationship of principal and agent was createdor is to be implied. There was no direct contract of agency between the plaintiff and Kyosei Agencies but Mr. Bunting argues thatthe defendant has proved what he referred to as a "chain of agency". By purchasing the goods on the terms indicated in the invoicesfrom which I have quoted the consignor was, he suggests, authorised to take all necessary steps to ensure that the goods reachedthe plaintiff as consignee in Hong Kong. By consigning the goods he took the first step in doing so and by accepting the terms ofthe bills of lading impliedly on behalf of the plaintiff authorised the shipping company to employ, on behalf of the plaintiff, theKyosei Agencies so that when the Kyosei Agencies following their usual course of business placed the goods in the godown of the defendantthey did so as agent of the plaintiff. This argument is not only to ignore the possible application of the maxim delegatus delegarenon potest but also requires the making of quite unjustifiable assumptions. I am asked to infer not one agency but to imply consentto a sub-agency on a sub-agency. As I understand it, it is a general rule that delegation where permitted does not create privity-of-contractbetween principal and sub-agent. Without privity-of-contract existing I cannot follow how a sub-agent can in turn have implied authorityto appoint a sub-sub-agent. I cannot regard the Kyosei Agencies as agents of the plaintiff. If they are so to be regarded there isno evidence before me to indicate that they had authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the plaintiff discharging the defendantfrom liability in the event of the plaintiff suffering loss through the negligence of the defendant. It is noteworthy that the contracton which the defendant seeks to rely existed long before the creation of any agency if one is to be inferred and that there has beenno evidence that the plaintiff ever knew of it. I consider that I cannot hold that Kyosei Agencies was the agents of the plaintiff.If they were, they were not expressly or impliedly authorised by the plaintiff or anyone on behalf of the plaintiff to deposit theplaintiff's goods with the defendant on terms incorporated in an agreement which came into existence long before the plaintiff'sgoods arrived in Hong Kong - terms which were unknown to the plaintiff. To hold otherwise would be to place unjustifiable limitationson the freedom of principals to appoint and direct their agents.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The alternative defence is that the goods were stored in the defendant's godown as sub-bailee with the implied consent of the plaintiffwho therefore impliedly consented to the terms on which they were accepted. The defendant, it is argued may owe the plaintiff allthe duties of bailees for reward but these duties are to be discovered by reference to the conditions contained in the agreementmade between the defendant as sub-bailee and the Kyosei Agencies as bailees.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The principal modern authority as to the liability of a sub-bailee to the first bailor was recognised in <u>Gilchrist Watt Ltd.</u> v. <u>York</u> <u>Products</u><sup>(3)</sup> at page 1269 to be <u>Morris</u> v. <u>C.W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup> In <u>Morris</u> v. <u>C.W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup> a mink stole sent by the plaintiff to a furrier to be cleaned was with the consent of the plaintiff sent to the defendants as cleaningspecialists for them to clean it under a contract between them and the furrier. This contract contained what were called "exemptingconditions" or an "exemptions clause" which were held not to be so framed as to protect the defendants. The fur was stolen by thedefendants' servant whose duty was to clean it. It was held that the defendants had a non-contractual liability to the plaintiff.Diplock L.J. expressly left open the question:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"whether any exceptions clause in a contract to which the plaintiff was not a party would be effective to modify any duty owed atcommon law by the defendants to the plaintiff in respect of their custody of her fur."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Salmon, L.J. was equally non-committed contenting himself with agreeing that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Even if the defendants could rely against the plaintiff upon the printed conditions, to which we have been referred, their liabilitywould not be excluded."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Lord Denning M.R. in the dicta on which Mr. Bunting found himself obliged to place considerable reliance had this to say:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%" class="quote">Now comes the question: Can the defendants rely, as against the plaintiff, on the exempting conditions although there was no contractdirectly between them and her? There is much to be said on each side. On the one hand, it is hard on the plaintiff if her just claimis defeated by exempting conditions of which she knew nothing and to which she was not a party. On the other hand, it is hard onthe defendants if they are held liable to a greater responsibility than they agreed to undertake. As long ago as 1601 Lord Coke adviseda bailee to stipulate specially that he would not be responsible for theft, see Southcote's Case, a case of theft by a servant. Itwould be strange if his stipulation was of no avail to him. The answer to the problem lies, I think, in this: the owner is boundby the conditions if he has expressly or impliedly consented to the bailee making a sub-bailment containing those conditions, butnot otherwise. Suppose the owner of goods lets them out on hire, and the hirer sends them for repair, and the repairer holds themfor a lien. The owner is bound by the lien because he impliedly consented to the repairs being done, since they were reasonably incidentalto use of the car: see <u>Tappenden</u> v. <u>Artus</u>. So also if the owner of a ship accepts goods for carriage on a bill of lading containing exempting conditions (i.e. a 'bailmentupon terms') the owner of the goods (although not a party to the contract) is bound by those conditions if he impliedly consentedto them as being in 'the known and contemplated form', see the words of Lord Sumner in <u>Elder, Dempster &amp; Co.</u> v. <u>Paterson Zochonis &amp; Co. Ltd.</u> which were regarded by Dixon C.J. and Fullagar J. as stating the ratio decidendi, see <u>Wilson</u> v. <u>Darling Island Stevedoring &amp; Lighterage Co. Ltd.</u> with whose judgment Viscount Simonds entirely agreed in <u>Midland Silicones Ltd.</u> v. <u>Scruttons Ltd.</u> and also the cases to which I referred in that case.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          In this case the plaintiff agreed that Beder should send the fur to the defendants, and by so doing I think she impliedlyconsented to his making a contract for cleaning on the terms usually current in the trade."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">Earlier in the judgment the Master of the Rolls had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"By which I take it that if the sub-bailment is for reward, the sub-bailee owes to the owner all the duties of a bailee for reward:and the owner can sue the sub-bailee direct for loss of or damage to the goods (<u>unless he is protected by any exempting conditions</u>) is liable unless he can prove that the loss or damage occurred without his fault or that of his servants."

Again I feel that Diplock L.J.had greater reservations as to the applicability of the "exempting conditions" than is apparent from his deliberately refrainingfrom expressing an opinion about it for the opening words of his judgment warn that "the legal route" which has led him to his conclusion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"is not at all points identical with that traversed by the Master of the Rolls. After all, that is the beauty of the common law; itis a maze and not a motorway."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In <u>Gillespie Brothers</u> v. <u>Roy Bowles</u> <u>Ltd.</u><sup>(5)</sup> the plaintiffs in London ordered watches from Switzerland for resale to buyers in Jamaica. The parcel was placed in bond in London.The plaintiffs entered into a contract with forwarding agents to arrange for transhipment. This contract contained a stipulationto the effect that it was subject to certain standard conditions among which were conditions that all goods were carried subjectto any conditions stipulated by carriers into whose possession or custody the goods might pass and that in no case should the liabilityof the forwarding agents exceed Â£50 per ton. The forwarding agents hired a carrier on a monthly basis and the watches were stolenthrough the negligence of the driver of the carrier who remained the servant of the carrier. The plaintiff sued the carrier as tortfeasors and obtained judgment for Â£1,008 for negligence. Relying on conditions of carriage incorporated into the contract betweenthe carrier and the forwarding agents the carrier in third party proceedings sought indemnity against the forwarding agents so thatthe case turned on the question whether the indemnity clause covered the carrier for the negligence of its servant. Although thecarrier by its defence claimed to have been instructed to carry the package by the owners agents, the forwarding agents and averredthat it was entitled under the conditions to limit its liability there was no appeal by the carrier against the judgment establishingits liability to the plaintiff. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is therefore of little assistance to me here. It seems clearfrom his judgment however that the Master of the Rolls had not changed his mind as to his obiter in <u>Morris</u> v. <u>C.W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In <u>Harris Ltd.</u> v. <u>Continental Express Ltd.</u> <u>and Burn Transit Ltd.</u><sup>(6)</sup> the plaintiff entrusted its goods to the first defendant for transmission and their contract with the first defendant contained stringent"exemption conditions". The first defendant in its turn entrusted the goods to the second defendant. The goods were lost in transitthrough the negligence of the second defendant's servant the driver of a vehicle in which the goods were carried. The conditionsof agreement between the first and second defendants included the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"12. Burn Transit shall not be responsible for any goods carried deposited or left in any vehicles used in connection with this hiringagreement or for any money or valuable articles entrusted to the driver."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Paull, J. observed at page 259:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the second defendants therefore being liable prima facie for the negligence of their servant, I cannot see that the terms ofthe contract between the first defendant and the second defendant can in any way affect the plaintiffs. Mr. Stephenson for the plaintiffs,is right when he says that in order for these defendants to succeed the second defendants must in some way be brought into contractualrelationship with the plaintiffs before the plaintiffs can be affected by any terms of the contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Again in <u>Learoyd</u> v. <u>Pope</u><sup>(7)</sup> it was held by Sachs, J. in similar circumstances that the terms of a contract between a bailee and his sub-bailee were of no concernto the owner. Having referred to the cases of <u>Harris</u> v. <u>Continental Express Ltd. and Burn Transit Ltd.</u> (supra) and <u>Lee Cooper Ltd.</u> v. <u>C.H.</u> <u>Jeakins &amp; Sons Ltd.</u> (supra) he he goes on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I do not propose to discuss them in detail or to attempt to add to the store of learning that is embodied in those respective judgmentsor in certain other judgments cited which deal with the position of sub-bailees such for instance as <u>Harris</u> v. <u>C.W.</u> <u>Martin &amp; Sons Ltd.</u> (supra). Suffice it to say that it is to my mind clear that where the vehicle is one which remains with its driver under the generalcontrol of the sub-contractor, that sub-contractor (or whatever either name it may be wished to give him) is in the position of baileeto the owner of the load on the vehicle ... to my mind the precise contractual terms on which the head-contractor and the sub-contractorwere working is no more the concern of the third party affected than it was in the case of the Mersey Docks decision (see the speechof Lord Simons 1947 A.C. at page 20) it would indeed in practice produce lamentable confusion if in such a common situation as thatwith which the court is now concerned the position of the third party was in law dependant upon such factors - with all the refinementsthat can result."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In <u>Monkataff</u> v. <u>B.O.A.C.</u><sup>(8)</sup> Browne J. when dealing with a case in which B.O.A.C. carried the plaintiffs' money as a result of certain agreements with the PostOffice for the carriage of mail by B.O.A.C. had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am, therefore, of the opinion that even if B.O.A.C. were entitled in some way to rely as against the plaintiff on their agreementswith the Post Office, these agreements would not exclude or limit their common law duties to the plaintiff or afford any defenceto a breach of these duties. In these circumstances I hope I shall not be thought to be pusillanimous or discourteous if I followthe example of Lord Justice Diplock in <u>Morris</u> v. <u>Martin</u> (supra) and deliberately refrain from expressing any opinion on the very difficult question whether or not the plaintiff would havebeen 'affected' by these agreements if they had been in some different and unknown terms."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In the instant case there has been no evidence that the plaintiff knew of the terms of the agreement between the defendant and theKyosei Agencies. Even accepting the dictum of the Master of the Rolls as correct one is left with the question whether or not theplaintiff impliedly consented to them as being in the "known and contemplated form". I am wholly unsatisfied on the evidence I haveheard that the exempting conditions in this case can be said to have been in a "known and contemplated form" or to have been "termsusually current in the trade". The evidence falls far short of that. When asked about them Mr. CHENG Tien-shum that the transactionwas a "perfectly ordinary transaction such as we had with" the shipping agency and that the defendant had "exactly the same relationshipswith others" the defendant's conditions were "more or less the same as prevails in Hong Kong". The managing director of the shippingagency said that he would "have expected" to see a condition absolving godown keepers from liability in "certain cases". He toldus that there were in the case of three companies with which the shipping agency dealt oral agreements on terms which usually embodiedexemption clauses. He had however never read the conditions in question himself and so clearly could not say if they were in a "knownand contemplated form" or in a form "usually current in the trade". Mr. CHIU Yen-leng the assistant manager of a large shipping lineof not inconsiderable experience did not know for what risks godown keepers accept liability. It is, he suggested "case by case".If this be correct there could be no question of the plaintiff having impliedly consented to terms of which he could not be fixedwith knowledge. Under cross-examination the plaintiff's representative frankly admitted that he would have expected the Kyosei Agenciesto have entered into a standing agreement with a godown for the taking in of cargo but he was unaware of the practice of limitationof liability by godowns. He was not in the shipping department of the plaintiff at the time of the arrival of the goods in questionand what he knew of the transaction was from information obtained in his capacity of chief accountant. On these facts I am not satisfiedthat the plaintiff knew or ought to have known of the exemption clauses. Hence he could not be said to have impliedly consented tothem. Although it is not necessary for me for these reasons to decide whether the dictum of the Master of the Rolls correctly setsout the law, I should have had difficulty in accepting it. The principal reason for this difficulty stems from the fact that thedoctrine to which the Master of the Rolls himself referred in <u>Greene</u> v. <u>Chelsea</u> <u>Borough Council</u> (supra) as the "privity-of-contract" doctrine had received its quietus in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u><sup>(9)</sup>. If it be accepted as I judge it to be that a sub-bailee's duty to an owner arises in tort independently of contract I find it difficultto see how that tortious liability can be limited by a contract to which the owner is not a party. I, like Paull, J. and Sachs, J.in the passages I have quoted above, find difficulty in seeing how the terms of a contract between the defendant and the Kyosei Agenciescould affect the plaintiff. In conclusion I would remark that I find it unnecessary to refer at length to those cases in which questionsof sub-bailment did not arise in which the courts have displayed a reluctance to saddle a party whose person or goods have been injuredwith notice of a condition limiting liability in negligence. Such cases as <u>Thornton</u> v. <u>Shoe Lane Parking Ltd.</u><sup>(10)</sup> (in which Megaw, L.J. observed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"All I say is that it (an exempting condition) is so wide and destructive of rights that the court should not hold any man bound byit unless it is drawn to his attention in the most explicit way"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">a remark which might well be applied to the exempting condition on which the defendant here seeks to rely) while of interest in showingthe general tendency of courts (even in days such as these when pride in a job well done seems to have declined) to scrutinize mostcarefully the details of transactions in which exemption clauses are prayed in aid to avoid liability for negligence are not strictlyin point. This tendency is also apparent in cases where exclusion clauses themselves fall to be construed. See for example <u>White</u> v. <u>John Warwick &amp; Co. Ltd.</u><sup>(11)</sup> and <u>Fagan</u> v. <u>Green &amp; Edwards</u><sup>(12)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I prefer however to base my decision on the ground that the plaintiff cannot be said impliedly to have consented to the terms usedhere because they have not been shown to be in a "known and contemplated form" nor to have been in "terms usually current in thetrade". It has been suggested that a decision to this effect will have the effect of preventing the defendant from carrying on itsbusiness. I do not accept that. It can insure against negligence or obtain an indemnity from the actual depositor against negligenceor better still be not negligent in the way it carries out its work.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $33,270.63 and costs.
