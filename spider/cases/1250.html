At the conclusion of the hearing, judgmentwas reserved which we now give.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff was 12 years old at the time of the accident which occurred on 21 October 2001.  At that time, the plaintiff, hisparents and his younger brother were living in a flat at Tin Shing Court, Tin Shui Wai.  They had moved there in January 2000, shortlyafter the completion of the development which had been built for the first defendant, the Housing Authority.  The family obtainedresidentsâ cards after having registered themselves as residents of the development.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Within the development was a seven storey building managed by the second defendant, comprising two floors of shops and five floorsof car parks.  On the roof of the building were tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, separated by wire mesh fences about 6 mhigh.  At the time of the accident, only the two basketball courts were open for use by residents between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. on adaily basis.  The volleyball and tennis courts remained locked up: they were awaiting remedial work and had never been in use.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The accident</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Shortly after 8 a.m. on the day in question, the plaintiff and his younger brother went to the basketball court on their own.  Itwas the plaintiffâs evidence that almost every Saturday and Sunday he would play there with his brother.  Their parents did notaccompany them on the occasion in question but had gone jogging.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  There was some dispute as to where a resident wishing to use one of the two basketball courts was supposed to register by showinghis residentâs card before using the court.  According to the plaintiff and his father, it was at the registration counter nearthe ball courts which was not always manned.  According to the second defendant it was to be done at the management office on theground floor which was manned 24 hours a day.  The judge made no express finding on that issue but found as a fact that residents,or indeed anyone, could in fact simply enter the basketball courts without registering.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It was the plaintiffâs evidence that the registration counter was unmanned when he arrived with his brother and so they went onto one of the courts without registering.  In the course of play, the ball accidentally went over the fence into the adjoining, lockedvolleyball court.  There was still no one at the registration counter so the plaintiff went down to the security guard post on theground floor of the shopping centre to look for a watchman or guard but without success.  He returned to the basketball court andwaited for about half an hour until around 9 a.m. in the hope that a watchman or guard would appear, but no one materialised beforehe was due back home.  Being extremely anxious to retrieve the ball and faced with no alternative, he decided to climb over the fence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The physical layout and characteristics of the ball court complex were as described in the following passage of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">8.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">The ball court complex is surrounded, and the individual courts within it are divided by high fencing made of steel tubing and wiremesh, about six metres in height.  The perimeter fence is supported by a series of stands with a triangular cross-section.  The standlooks like three ladders placed vertically in an isosceles triangle with one side against the mesh.  From the photographs it appearsthat the mesh is about 6 cm square.  The horizontal tubes, or rungs of these stands are 31.75 cm wide and 24 cm in circumference. The internal fencing between the courts is also supported by stands but they are flat rather than triangular, though the dimensionsof the tubes are the same; these stands look like single ladders to which the mesh is attached.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The judge found that the plaintiff climbed up one of the external triangular stands and down the other side of it into the volleyballcourt.  Having retrieved the ball and thrown it back into the basketball court, he then climbed up one of the flats dividing stands. After getting over the top, he fell from one of the rungs near the top of the stand to the floor of the basketball court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The judgment below</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The judge found (and it was not challenged) that the plaintiff had entered the basketball court as a visitor.  This must be correctsince the plaintiffâs right to use the court arose from the fact of his being a resident and, in any event, he had a residentâscard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  But the judge held that when the plaintiff climbed the fence, he ceased to be a visitor and became a trespasser because he did nothave the defendantsâ permission to climb the fencing nor did he have their permission to enter the volleyball court.  He took theview that the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ) did not apply to the plaintiff.  He also found that there was nothing dangerous in the state of thefences themselves which were perfectly sound.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The judge then considered the duty owed to the plaintiff as a trespasser.  He held that the law applicable in Hong Kong was thatset out by the House of Lords in <i>British Railways Board v Herrington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20877" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 877</a>, identifying and citing two passages from the speeches of Lord Diplock and Lord Morris (at pages 941 and 909) respectively.  Thejudge turned to the particular circumstances before him and found as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">38.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">There is no suggestion that [the second defendant] knew that trespassers did in fact climb the fencing, but it must have known, forit left the courts unsupervised from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., apart from visits by a patrolling guard, that persons, including childrenwould be in a position to climb the fencing if they wanted to; and there would be nothing and no one to stop them. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">39.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">It is also a fact of life that, no matter how high one may build a fence around a ball court to keep the balls in, sooner or latersome player will, through inadvertence or lack of skill, manage to put a ball out of the court.  If a ball goes out of play in thisway, the obvious remedy, where this is possible, is to go and fetch it back.  If the ball goes into an area where one is not supposedto go, e.g. a neighbourâs garden, there is nevertheless a temptation to go there, even if that means climbing a wall or fence. It is notorious that children have been succumbing to that temptation that from time immemorial.  The only difference between thatsituation and the situation here is that in the present case the fence was very high. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">40.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">High though the fences may be, to a young person possessed of normal fitness, fortitude and self-reliance they would appear an easyclimb.  The triangular and the flat stands are in the form of ladders with rungs.  Anyone could go up them easily.  One who did somight have problems climbing up or down the mesh side, because the mesh is quite small, and it might be difficult to get the toesof his shoes securely into it.  Nevertheless, there are plenty of hand-holds and toe-holds.  The climb would be easier than thaton an artificial rock-climbing wall, for instance, and probably much easier.  Indeed the plaintiff, having got up the triangularstand, must have got down the mesh side into the volleyball court without mishap. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">41.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">It seems to me, therefore, that any reasonable person must expect that from time to time balls would go out of the basketball courtinto the closed volleyball court, and sooner or later, some basketball player would go over the fence to get his ball back.  Theprobability of this happening was low, but, especially where the courts were unsupervised, the risk was there.  It was thereforethe duty of [the second defendant], in the words of Lord Morris, to take such steps as common sense or common humanity would dictateto exclude or to warn or otherwise within reasonable and practicable limits to reduce or avert danger.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In considering whether there had been a breach of the duty of care, the judge resolved the disputed evidence as to whether or notat the relevant time there was a notice on the wall outside the registration office indicating a telephone number which the userscould call for assistance.  On that issue he accepted the plaintiffâs evidence and held that on the day of the accident there wasno notice giving a number to call for assistance.  He concluded that the absence of such a notice</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">was a breach of the limited duty which the 2nd defendant owed to any person who was in the foreseeable but not very likely situationof having lost his ball into the closed court and wishing to retrieve it.  If there had been a notice, the plaintiff could have calledthe number.  He would not have climbed the fences and the accident would have been avoided.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It was on that basis that he held the second defendant liable to the plaintiff for negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On the issue of contributory negligence, he found the plaintiff 50% liable for the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The substantive point taken on this appeal was that the judge was wrong in holding that the second defendant owed to the plaintiffa duty of care as a trespasser.  Mr Lam who appeared for the second defendant submitted that the <i>Herrington</i> test is that stated by Lord Diplock (at 941E) and cited by the judge in Â§ 32 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The duty does not arise until the occupier has actual knowledge either of the presence of the trespasser upon his land or facts whichmake it likely that the trespasser will come on to his land; and has also <i>actual knowledge of facts as to the condition of his land or of activities carried out upon it which are likely to cause personalinjury to a trespasser who is unaware of the danger.â (emphasis added)</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">He also drew attention to the fact that at an earlier part of his speech, Lord Diplock had said (at 929H-930A) that</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">there is no duty owed by an occupier to any trespasser unless he <i>actually knows of the physical facts in relation to the state of his land or some activity carried out upon it</i>, which constituted a serious danger to persons on the land who are unaware of those facts.â <i>(emphasis added)</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Lam submitted that the italicized words in both passages from Lord Diplockâs speech made it clear that a pre-requisite or conditionof the duty arising was that the âdangerâ about which the occupier must know had to relate to âthe conditions of his land orof activities carried out upon itâ and had to be âhiddenâ and that the pre-requisite had not been satisfied in the presentcase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The difficulty with Mr Lamâs submission is that the pre-requisite referred to above is not to be found in the speeches of theother members of the House of Lords.  Lord Reidâs formulation of the duty (at 899B-C) was as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">So the question whether an occupier is liable in respect of an accident to a trespasser on his land would depend on whether a conscientioushumane man with his knowledge, skill and resources could reasonably have been expected to have done or refrained from doing beforethe accident something which would have avoided it.  If he knew before the accident that there was a substantial probability thattrespassers would come I think that most people would regard as culpable failure to give any thought to their safety.  He might oftenreasonably think, weighing the seriousness of the danger and the degree of likelihood of trespassers coming against the burden hewould have to incur in preventing their entry or making his premises safe, or curtailing his own activities on his land, that hecould not fairly be expected to do anything.

It is clear that no member of the House of Lords considered that theoccupation of land in itself created a situation whereby the occupier owed a duty to all persons on his land; that arose in the wherepersons were lawfully on the land.  Before it could be said that the duty was owed to a trespasser, and before consideration couldbe given to the content of that duty, there had to be a finding of some additional and special facts which would entitle a courtto hold that the occupier owed a duty to the trespasser.  These special facts or special situations were the variously described.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">After referring to the differing formulations of that duty to be found in the speeches of the members of the House of Lords, the Reportstated that it was</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">difficult to conclude that the question as to when the special facts gave rise to a duty to the trespasser received an entirely consistentanswer in<i>Herringtonâs</i> case.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In England, the lack of clarity and therefore uncertainty as to the <i>Herrington</i> duty led to legislation in the form of the Occupiersâ Liability Act 1984 following the recommendation of the Law Commission tocreate a statutory duty to trespassers.  However, Hong Kong did not follow suit and has no parallel legislation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In the present case, the uncertainties created by <i>Herrington</i> are perhaps academic because although the judge appeared to consider that the relevant duty was a duty of care owed to the plaintiffas a trespasser, on closer analysis, his reasons for holding the second defendant liable were entirely consistent with a duty ofcare owed to the plaintiff as a lawful visitor to the basketball court.  To such a visitor, the second defendant plainly owed a dutyto take reasonable care to ensure his safety.  The relevant test is based on foreseeability.  Mr Lam acknowledged that it was reasonablyforeseeable and not at all fanciful that a ball might accidentally be knocked over the fence into an adjoining court.  It was equallyforeseeable that in those circumstances a basketball player like the plaintiff would wish to retrieve his ball.  Thus the duty thejudge found to have been breached was nothing more than an appropriate step that ought to have been taken by the second defendantthat would have afforded a means of enabling the ball to be retrieved without exposing the player to unnecessary risk.  But if anotice giving a number to call for assistance is to have any meaningful effect, it must be given to the player before he becomesa trespasser by the activity of climbing the fence.  Logically, the duty must have been owed to him while he was still a lawful visitor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  When this was put to Mr Lam, he referred to the House of Lordsâ decisionin<i>Tomlinson</i>, as I understand it, as authority for the proposition that no duty is owed to a potential trespasser to prevent him from becominga trespasser.  That case concerned the duty of care owed by the owners and managers of a country park to a trespasser under the OccupiersâLiability Act 1984.  The park contained a lake which was a disused quarry.  Swimming was prohibited and there were prominent noticesto that effect.  The plaintiff who was a visitor to the park went into the lake and from a standing position in shallow water divedand struck his head on the bottom, breaking his neck.  Whilst it is true that the plaintiff in that case conceded that he was indeeda trespasser when he went into the water, the issue of liability turned on whether the injury sustained could be attributed to thefault of the defendants.  I do not read <i>Tomlinson</i> as laying down any general principle that no duty can ever be owed by an occupier to a potential trespasser.  The decision was basedentirely on the 1984 Act which has no counterpart in Hong Kong and which, in any event, is distinguishable on the facts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On the facts of the present case, the judge could not be criticised for his conclusion that the second defendant owed the plaintiffa duty of care in the form of exhibiting a notice giving a number to call for assistance.  In my view, that duty was owed to theplaintiff <i>qua</i> visitor given that he was using the basketball court for a lawful purpose and the foreseeability of both the ball being knocked overthe fence during such lawful user and the plaintiff wanting to retrieve it.  The duty could not have been owed to him <i>qua</i> trespasser because the steps required to discharge the duty would serve no purpose once he had become as trespasser.  It would simplybe too late.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  If that be right, it will not be necessary to address the other criticisms of the judgment made by Mr Lam in the context of theduty owed to a trespasser.  It was said that the degree of likelihood that someone would climb the fence as found by the judge atÂ§Â§ 41 and 54 (i.e. the probability was âlowâ and ânot very likelyâ) was insufficient to cause a duty of care to a trespasserto arise and that the appropriate test in the case of a trespasser is the âsubstantial chanceâ test.  Mr Lam referred to <i>Southern Cement Ltd v Cooper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 623</a> where (at 644D-E) Lord Reid said:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Next comes the question to whom does the occupier owe a duty.

It was argued that the duty could be limited to cases where the comingof trespassers is more probable than not.  Their Lordships can find neither principle nor authority nor any practical reason to justifysuch a limitation.  The only rational or practical answer would seem to be that the occupier is entitled to neglect a bare possibilitythat trespassers may come to a particular place on his land but is bound at least to give consideration to the matter when he knowsfacts which show a substantial chance that they may come there.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">That passage appeared to have been premised on a distinction of substance between something that is âextremely probableâ (whichwas expressly rejected as the appropriate test) and âfacts which show a substantial chanceâ.  For my part, I find the distinctionsomewhat obscure.  In any event, while it seems clear that an occupier is âentitled to neglect a bare possibilityâ, what constitutesa âsubstantial chanceâ has to be read with the paragraphs immediately following (at 644F and H):</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Such consideration should be all-embracing.
