In fact the computer business has become so widespreadthat it has been said that the human race has been âcomputerisedâ ever since the creation of computer.  Moreover, not only isthe computer business so active and profitable, the business of <i>organizing</i> a computer festival is an incidental business by itself. </p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff âthe Chamber of Hong Kong Computer Industry Co.

It hasestablished its own goodwill and reputation.  Further, as a result of media reporting, it has also acquired goodwill and reputationin the name of âShamshuipo Computer Festivalâ (æ·±æ°´åé»è¦ç¯), âHong Kong Computer Festival I.T.

This was called âShamshuipo Computer <i>Malls</i> Computer Festivalâ (æ·±æ°´åè¦å ´é»è¦ç¯) at 4 computer shopping malls in Shamshuipo, namely :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)      Golden Computer Arcade (é»éé»è¦åå ´),</p>        <p>(ii)     Golden Computer Centre (é«ç»é»è¦ä¸­å¿),</p>        <p>(iii)    Golden Computer Plaza (é«ç»é»è¦å»£å ´), and</p>        <p>(iv)    New Capital Computer Plaza (æ°é«ç»é»è¦å»£å ´). </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  That was just 3 days before the plaintiffâs LSCE of âHong Kong Computer Festival 2009 I.T.

The plaintiff complainedthat the defendant has passed off its LSCE as that of the plaintiffâs.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Thereafter in this case, the Writ of Summons with the Statement of Claim endorsed therein was issued on 4 May 2010.  It is a passing-offaction against the defendant.  The defence was filed on 15 June 2010 and the Reply on 13 July 2010.  </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Two days afterwards, the plaintiffâs summons for interlocutory injunction against the defendant was filed and served.  It wasseeking an injunction to restrain the defendant from holding another LSCE on 18 to 25 August 2010 by the name of âShamshuipo ComputerMalls Summer Computer Festivalâ (æ·±æ°´åè¦å ´å¤æ¥é»è¦ç¯).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The plaintiff alleged that since it has already acquired the goodwill and reputation in the trade name of âHong Kong ComputerFestivalâ (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦ç¯) and/or âShamshuipo Computer Festivalâ (æ·±æ°´åé»è¦ç¯), the defendantâs name is passing offthe trade name of the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  However the defendant pointed out that in fact the reason behind this application of the plaintiff (i.e. the plaintiff only withoutthe Shamshuipo District Council) is that it is organizing a commercially profit-seeking LSCE at the Hong Kong Convention and ExhibitionCentre 2 days thereafter from 20 to 23 August 2010.  This is called âHong Kong Computer &amp; Communications Festival 2010 (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦éè¨ç¯2010)â. However it was not the one organized jointly with the Shamshuipo District Council, and the venue is not in Shamshuipo, but one bythe plaintiff alone elsewhere at the HKCEC in Wanchai.  The defendant said that the plaintiff is furious and jealous of the defendantâsLSCE because any computer festival would promote products at a bigger discount, (e.g. here the defendantâs retailer is offering300 Notebooks at half price).  The plaintiff is said to be afraid that its retailers would suffer if they are selling the same productseven at the same rate of discount.  It is not, therefore, genuinely complaining that the defendant is passing off the plaintiffâsgoodwill and reputation, if any, in the name of the Computer Festival in Shamshuipo.  It is actually going after the defendant to<i>protect</i> the plaintiffâs Exhibition in Wanchai, in which the plaintiff has no prior goodwill and reputation. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Johnny So, counsel for the defendant, in his oral submissions asked rhetorically :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)      If the plaintiff has organized :</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     a Beer Festival (å¤éç¯);</p>            <p>(b)     a Food Festival (ç¾é£ç¯); or</p>            <p>(c)      a Fleas Market Festival (è·³è¤<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>å¸å ´ç¯);</p>        </blockquote>        <p>does it mean that no one else could organize any Beer, Food or Fleas Market Festival?</p>        <p>(ii)     What if San Miguel organized a San Miguel Beer Festival, does it mean that Carlsberg or Heineken cannot organize a Beer Festivalin their own trade name?</p>        <p>(iii)    If one organized a German Beer Festival, does it mean that Tsing Tao Beer<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> cannot organize a Tsing Tao Beer Festival?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Vincent Poon, counsel for the plaintiff was asked whether the <i>Hong Kong Arts Festival</i> can object to another organization holding a <i>Hong Kong Orchestral Music Festival</i>. He submitted that the former <i>cannot</i> object to the latterâs name and operation.  It turned out that he was not familiar with the Hong Kong Arts Festival which usuallytakes place in February and March each year since 1973.  It included orchestral music with usually one foreign and world-class orchestratogether with our 2 local orchestras. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Poon was asked to the effect of this question : what <i>if</i> the Hong Kong Orchestral Music Festival invited the Berlin Philharmonic, the Weiner Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, togetherwith the Hong Kong Philharmonic to perform in Hong Kong for the whole month of January 2011, (I must be dreaming), just before theHong Kong Arts Festival which has invited the Leipzig Gewandhaus Symphony in February/March 2011, can the latter successfully obtainan injunction from the Court, prohibiting the former from doing so? </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  At first Mr Poon submitted in the negative.  But admittedly as he is not familiar with these things, he then said he will have todo some research on these things. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The defence counselâs aforesaid rhetorical question together with the plaintiff counselâs answer to the question from the benchwill show the unreasonable attitude and action of the plaintiff.  In order to demonstrate that, the legal positions of the partiesâarguments will be examined more closely hereinbelow.</p>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The plaintiffâs cause of action herein is the tort of <i>passing off</i>.  It has been said in <i>Kerlyâs Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i> (14 ed.) at p. 431 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPassing off is a single common law cause of action which can apply in a very wide range of factual situations. The breadth of thetort is such that, despite some views to the contrary, it now appears to be generally accepted that it is permissible to define twoforms of the cause of action : the classic form, defined by the âclassical trinityâ, and the âextended formâ,â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The âclassical trinityâ is enough for the circumstances of this case.  This has been explained by the House of Lords in theâ<i>Jif Lemon</i>â<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> case :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe âJif Lemonâ case is important in at least two respects. First, the House of Lords confirmed that each passing off casedepended on its own facts. Secondly, their Lordships reverted to the âclassical trinityâ for their definition of the elementsof the cause of action. Lord Oliver put the matters a successful claimant must prove as follows :</p>        <p class="quote">âFirst, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasingpublic by association with the identifying âget-upâ (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or theindividual features of labeling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that theget-up is recognized by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs goods or services.</p>        <p class="quote">Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely tolead the public to belief that the goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a <i>quia timet</i> action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâs misrepresentation thatthe source of the defendantâs goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.ââ<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">I.

Carnivalâ; or âåäººç æ©å¤§å¯æ¼Do-It-YourselfAssemblyâ; or âèèªè³è¨ç§æå¤§å¯å±Christmas I.T. Showâ. In other words, whilst each name, of course, began with HongKong Computer Festival (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦ç¯), it also ended with another phrase of descriptive words. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The question is : has the plaintiff acquired a goodwill and reputation in the name of Hong Kong Computer Festival (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦ç¯)<i>simpliciter</i> to such an extent that anyone using these few words in any combination would be guilty of passing off its own name as that of theplaintiffâs?  Putting it in another way as in line with the first element in the âclassical trinityâ, has the name of âHongKong Computer Festivalâ under which the plaintiffâs service are offered to the public, become so distinctive such that the get-upis recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs services. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In this respect, one can compare the name Hong Kong Arts Festival and Hong Kong Orchestral Music Festival.  The question is whetherthe formerâs goodwill and reputation would include all kinds of Hong Kong festivals in arts and thus no one is allowed to holdHong Kong Orchestral Music Festival, Hong Kong Opera, Drama, Film or Dance Festival?  In other words, can the plaintiff âmonopoliseâthe name of âHong Kong Computer Festivalâ by the actual name it used for the Shamshuipo Computer Festival with all the otherdescriptive words following the first 4 words?</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Further, there are no âgoodsâ in respect of which the plaintiff has acquired a goodwill and reputation.  The plaintiffâs goodwilland reputation is only in the <i>services</i> of <i>organizing</i> a LSCE.  The goods shown or offered in the festival belonged to the individual booth owner, some of whom were selling one brand andothers were selling different brands of computer items.  These different brands have their own trademark and/or goodwill and reputationwhich should not be confused with the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.  People attending the plaintiffâs LSCE are moreinterested in looking for computer items offered at competitive prices of different brands, rather than <i>who</i> organized the exhibition or festival. In respect of the goodwill and reputation of the services offered by the plaintiff, it wouldbe the concern of the prospective individual booth owner who intended to participate in the festival.  However there should not beany confusion from the prospective booth owners (being experienced merchants in the computer business) as to who is the <i>organizer</i> of the festival. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Thus in respect of the first point in the âclassical trinityâ, the plaintiff has not acquired a goodwill and reputation in thesimple name of the âHong Kong Computer Festival (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦ç¯)â to such an extent that anyone in Hong Kong using the wordsâComputer Festival (é»è¦ç¯)â in any combination would be passing off the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.  The questionof confusion will be discussed in the second point of the classical trinity. </p>    <p class="heading">II.    Misrepresentation</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  After we have ascertained that the <i>plaintiffâs customers</i> are primarily the booth owners participating in its LSCE who accepted the services of the plaintiff in organizing the same, thenfirst of all, one has to ascertain whether these owners would confuse the plaintiffâs services for those of the defendantâs orvice versa.  The booth owners are admittedly, merchants in the trade of computer items.  There is no suggestion at all that thesemerchants who participated or intended to participate in the plaintiffâs LSCE would have confused the defendantâs services forthat of the plaintiffâs.  Afterall the defendantâs services in organizing the LSCE would be offered to those shop owners in thefour shopping malls in Shamshuipo.  It is inconceivable that the shop owners of the malls would have confused the defendantâs servicesfor those of the plaintiffâs, who has been organizing the Shamshuipo Computer Festival in terms of I.T. Carnival Show, or Do-It-YourselfAssembly or Christmas I.T. Show elsewhere in the same district. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In any event those shop owners in the four malls would not have confused the festival organized by the defendant for that of theplaintiff in the HKCEC of Wanchai.  But obviously both sides admitted that the plaintiffâs services offered at the HKCEC in Wanchaishould have nothing to do with the defendantâs LSCE.  The plaintiff is not saying that because of its organization of the ShamshuipoComputer Festival, they have gained the goodwill and reputation in the name of the Hong Kong Computer Festival and this goodwilland reputation has somehow passed on to it when it is now organizing the one in Wanchai.  But the defendant pointed out that thisis the ulterior motive of the plaintiff, which shall be discussed in the next section under the title of âmaterial non-disclosureâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Is there any misrepresentation by the defendant that their Shamshuipo Computer Malls Computer Festival (æ·±æ°´åè¦å ´é»è¦ç¯)or Shamshuipo Computer Malls Summer Computer Festival (æ·±æ°´åè¦å ´å¤æ¥é»è¦ç¯), is the computer festival organized by theplaintiff?  Here I accept the submission of Mr So for the defendant that there could not possibly be any confusion even amoung theattendants of the LSCE.  The defendantâs LSCE is categorically held at those 4 malls in the Shamshuipo area, and in fact the 4malls are very near to each other; whereas the plaintiffâs LSCE in Shamshuipo has always been either in a playground or a designatedplace offered by the Shamshuipo District Council in the Shamshuipo or Cheung Sha Wan area as stated in the table hereinbefore betweenthe years 2002 up to January 2010.  </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Accordingly there is no misrepresentation by the defendant or passing-off by the defendant that their LSCE is the one organizedby the plaintiff in the past.  Further the defendant has, by means of press conferences and statements issued to the press, madeit very clear that it is a separate computer exhibition in competition with the LSCE organized by the Shamshuipo District Counciland the plaintiff.  It is a new and separate LSCE organized by the defendant and it is not the Hong Kong Computer Festival (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦ç¯)organized by the plaintiff.  In fact the media has widely published that there were two exhibitions competing with each other commerciallyat approximately the same time. </p>    <p class="heading">III.   Damages</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The plaintiff had no financial benefit to itself in the services organized by it together with Shamshuipo District Council in thepast Hong Kong Computer Festivals held in Shamshuipo/Cheung Sha Wan District.  The District Council has make it clear by the letterdated 10 May 2010 that any profit made in the LSCE organized by them would be used in other computer activities promoting I.T. applicationfor the Shamshuipo District. Accordingly, as submitted by the defendant, even if (which is denied by the defendant) the first elementof passing-off have been established as a serious issue to be tried, the plaintiffâs LSCE in which it said it has gained a goodwilland reputation by it, jointly with the District Council, the plaintiff would not suffer any damage as it has not gained any profitfor its own in the past years. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  What the plaintiff is actually complaining is that when they are organizing a LSCE commercially in HKCEC in Wanchai, they wouldhave suffered damage when the defendantâs LSCE is held just two days before its LSCE in Wanchai.  But the plaintiffâs cause ofaction does not depend on the LSCE held by it in Wanchai.  Accordingly that could not be considered.  Instead the fact that the plaintifffailed to disclose that they were organizing the Computer Festival in Wahchai, is relied on by the defendant as a kind of materialnon-disclosure which I shall deal with hereinbelow. </p>    <p class="heading">Material non-disclosure</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Shamshuipo District Council had decided not to organize the Hong Kong Computer Festival this year in the Shamshuipo Districtor at all.  However the plaintiff is now organizing a commercially profit-taking LSCE (not the subject of the LSCE organized jointlywith the District Council from which the plaintiff alleged that it has gained goodwill and reputation).  This LSCE is called âHongKong Computer and Communications Festival 2010â (é¦æ¸¯é»è¦éè¨ç¯2010).  It apparently is the real purpose for the plaintiffâsapplication for an injunction against the defendant.  In other words the plaintiff is using a legal method by claiming that it hasto protect the goodwill and reputation acquired by it in order to achieve its another commercial purpose with ulterior motive.  Assubmitted by the defendant, the plaintiff just wanted to eliminate its potential business competitors. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I consider that the plaintiff, in failing to disclose all these matters, would attract no sympathy from a court of justice in grantingan interlocutory injunction before trial, when it is quite obvious that the ulterior motive behind the injunction was to gain anunfair advantage over its competitor with no valid legal ground. </p>    <p class="heading">Balance of convenience</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Both parties are limited companies.  They have been keeping an account of their own LSCE in the past and in the future.  The accountwould show whether the defendant has damaged the alleged goodwill and reputation acquired by the plaintiff, if any.  The accountwould also show whether the defendant acquired any benefit from the LCSE âShamshuipo Computer Malls Summer Computer Festivalâto be organized on 18 to 25 August 2010.  In other words, damages would be sufficient if the plaintiff can prove at the trial thatthe plaintiff has suffered damage because of the Shamshuipo Computer Malls Computer Festival 2010 organized by the defendant in thefour shopping malls.  This obviously has nothing to do with the plaintiffâs computer festival organized by it alone in the HKCEC.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  On the contrary if the defendant is restrained by the injunction, especially when the Shamshuipo District Council has already decidednot to organize a LCSE with the plaintiff under the name âHong Kong Computer Festivalâ this year, the defendant would have suffereddamage by cancelling the LSCE in these four shopping malls.  There is a dispute between the parties as to the total amount of damagesanticipated at this stage.  The plaintiff submitted that it is no more than $80,000 whereas the defendant submitted that it wouldhave suffered more than $80,000.  Without going into detail, I consider that the injunction restricting the four shopping malls fromholding their LSCE organized by the defendant would have a greater impact on the defendantâs organization rather than on the plaintiffin refusing to grant the injunction. </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I consider that the plaintiff has not, even at this stage, established the three basic elements of passing-off, as described asthe âclassical trinityâ.  There is no serious issue to be tried. Even if there is a goodwill and reputation acquired by the plaintiff,there is no passing-off by the defendant.  In any event damages is an adequate remedy for the plaintiff should the plaintiff succeedat the trial.  On a balance of convenience, it is probably more convenient to refuse granting the injunction than by granting itagainst the defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  For the aforesaid reasons, I have dismissed the plaintiffâs application for interlocutory injunction. </p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The plaintiff came to this court with a case which cannot hold water.  It has no basis under any one of the three elements of theâclassical trinityâ.  The plaintiffâs application is also tainted with the ulterior motive of âprotectingâ its commercialLSCE in Wanchai, but it is not entitled to do so.
