We will call this contract "the MTR contract".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Then, by a construction contract dated December 10, 1980, between Telford as employer and the defendant/appellant. Shui On ConstructionCo. Ltd ("Shui On") as main contractor, Shui On agreed to construct 11 of those 21 blocks for Telford. We will call this contract"the Telford contract".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Another building contractor was appointed by Telford as the main contractor for the construction of the other 10 blocks.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> MTR complains of - but neither Telford nor Shui On admit - serious defects in all 21 blocks as built, which constitute Telford Gardens.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On June 17, 1986, MTR commenced an action against Telford and two guarantors of Telford's performance. In that action MTR seeks damageson the basis of such alleged defects. That action was formerly designated High Court Action No. A3518 of 1986. It is now designatedConstruction List No. 7 of 1989. We will call it "the MTR action".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Then, on April 3, 1987. Telford in turn commenced an action against Shui On on the basis that if the 11 blocks constructed by ShuiOn contain defects, then Shui On would be in breach of the Telford contract and would have been negligent. That action was formerlydesignated High Court Action No. A1946 of 1987. It is now designated Construction List No. 6 of 1989. We will call it "the Telfordaction".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It was in the Telford action that the order now appealed against was made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> On February 21, 1989, Shui On's application for a stay of the Telford action in favour of resolution by the architect or failingthat by arbitration was dismissed by Godfrey J. It was dismissed on terms. Those terms comprise : (i) Telford's undertaking to seekagainst Shui On only such damages as MTR recovers against it i.e. Telford in the MTR action; and (ii) liberty to Shui On to re-applyfor a stay if upon service of the Statement of Claim in the Telford action Shui On found therein allegations giving grounds for re-openingany decision or certificate of the architect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> That Statement of Claim was served on March 29, 1989, by which time the MTR action was in the process of discovery. Telford has notre-applied for a stay.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The MTR action will come on for hearing in September this year.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> We turn now to the preliminary issues ordered. it would be worthwhile to set out the preliminary issues and the paragraphs in theStatement of Claim in the Telford action and the supplementary condition in the Telford agreement referred to in the preliminaryissues.

Such discoveryas has been made has generated, or contributed to, some fresh thinking on time estimates.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Keating, who appears for Shui On before us but who did not appear in the Court below, estimates that the preliminary issues wouldtake-between 10 to 15 days to try. As far as the time which the trial of the whole action (consisting of the preliminary issues andall the other issues in the action including those pertaining to quantum) would take is concerned, Mr Keating said that it is somethingon which it is "incredibly difficult to form a view". He did, however, submit that it would take "very much longer than 4 weeks"and that it was obvious that it would take "many weeks".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> For Telford, Mr Scott's submission on the point is that until general discovery has been completed no estimate of any reliabilitycan be made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Turning to another matter, it is conceded by Mr Scott that if each and every one of the issues embodied in the preliminary issuesordered were decided against Telford, then that would be determinative of the action for all practical purposes. Mr Scott makes thatconcession on the basis that such a decision would leave Telford either wholly without remedy or without any remedy beyond a rightto nominal damages.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Even so, submits Mr Scott, it is neither just nor convenient to order the trial of any preliminary issue.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr Scott accepts that it is unlikely that much would have to be done in the way of resolving issues of fact when it comes to decidingthe issues under items (a), (b) and (c) of the preliminary issues ordered. At the same time Mr Keating accept that the question raisedunder item (d) stands differently in regard to the need to resolve facts. It may well be that in so far as that question pertainsto tort it is really besides the point in light of authorities such as <u>Tai Hing</u> <u>Cotton Mill v. Liu Chong Hing Bank</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] AC 80</a> in which Lord Scarman, delivering the advice of the Privy Council, said (at p. 107) that : "Their Lordships do not believe that thereis anything to the advantage of the law's development in searching for a liability in tort where the parties are in a contractualrelationship."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Recoverability under contract, however, is very much to the point.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> One of the questions put to Mr Keating from the bench was this: "If a building is built defectively, does remedial work to cure thedefects arise naturally i.e. according to the usual course of things?" Mr Keating's answer was "Yes". In light of that question andanswer it may be that, in so far as any defects arising from defective workmanship are proved, the expense of remedial work may berecoverable under the first rule in <u>Hadley v. Baxendale</u> (1854)9 Exch. 341 without any need to invoke the second rule in that case (as refined in later cases). The expense of remedial workdoes appear to be what MTR is seeking to recover. But, as Mr Keating has demonstrated (by reference to reply 4(b) of the particularsserved by MTR on April 14, 1989, in the MTR action) it would seem that MTR's complaints include at least some complaints as to design,and are not wholly confined to wokmanship. In any event, the fact of MTR's involvement is relied upon by Shui On as meaning thateven so much of Telford's claim as is grounded on workmanship defects would be too remote unless Shui On had at all material timesbeen aware of the material terms of the MTR agreement. Shui On denies such knowledge; and Telford is certainly not  prepared to takeso bold a course as to forgo an attempt to prove such knowledge on Shui On's part.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> So whether or not Shui On had such knowledge is a dispute of fact material to the trial of issue (d). It is to be noted that therewas an interval of no less than 4 years between the signing of the MTR contract and the signing of the Telford contract. That andthe long tender period of some 18 months for the latter suggest that the enquiry as to whether Shui On had acquired knowledge ofthe material terms of the former by the time it entered into the latter may well be an extensive one. Thus there is conviction inwhat he says when Mr Scott submits that there is a real possibility that a substantial number of witnesses would have to be proofedand called in regard to that dispute of fact. Mr Keating concedes that that cannot be excluded, although he submits that the probabilityis that the dispute would be resolved principally on documents. And although he suggests that the probability is that such documentationwill run to hundreds rather than thousands of pages, Mr Keating does not go so far as to suggest that Mr Scott's suggestion thata very large volume of documents may be relevant to the dispute can be brushed aside. Two other matters which illustrate the uncertaintyover how much time it would take to resolve this dispute of fact are worth mentioning. The first is that some of the documents discoveredby Shui On have been discovered upon an express reservation by it of its right to contend that such documents are not relevant. Thesecond is that Telford does not accept that Shui On's discovery in regard to such dispute is complete with or without that reservation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> One of the points taken on behalf of Telford is that, even assuming that one can safely estimate that the trial of the preliminaryissue will not take more than 15 days, it is unlikely that it can be held before September this year, which is when the trial ofthe MTR action will commence. We agree. And we also think that there is substance in the allied point that one cannot ignore thepossibility that the result of the MTR action may remove the need for Telford to pursue its claim against Shui On. And even failingthat, what occurs at the trial of the MTR action may assist - in one way or the other - in the preparation for and the conduct ofthe Telford action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> We also think that if - as is reasonably possible - the result of the trial of the preliminary issues (if there is going to be sucha trial) is taken on appeal to this Court and on further appeal to the Privy Council, then the delay that would be occasioned tothe main trial of the Telford action could.bevery great. That is an important consideration. One of the cases on Mr Keating's listof authorities is <u>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Herbert Smith &amp; Co.</u> [1969]1 Ch. 93. There the plaintiff East German Carl Zeiss Stiftung brought an action against the defendant West German Carl ZeissStiftung's solicitors seeking an account and payment of all moneys which they had received from the West German company in respectof fees, costs and disbursements. The Court of Appeal allowed the solicitors' appeal against Pennycuick J's refusal to order a preliminaryissue as to whether or not they were accountable to the East German company for such moneys received in good faith. Lord DenningMR (with whom Diplock and Sachs LJJ agreed) said this (at p.99 D-E):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was said that this issue is a serious issue which may go to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, and not be disposed offor a long time. That does not trouble me. It can and should be decided with expedition in every court. It can and should be decidedon the first day of next term in the Chancery Division; and, being an interlocutory matter, it can be brought on here within anotherweek. It can be decided by next month. I would allow this appeal and order the preliminary point in the terms set out in that letter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That case was a wholly exceptional one.: The solicitors concerned would be in an extremely awkward if not impossible position untilthe point was resolved - as would be any solicitors who might have been prepared to step into their shoes. Thus the West German companywas practically deprived of effective legal representation. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Master of Rolls was confidentthat every court. would deal with the matter with expedition. There is nothing to justify anything like the same degree or indeedkind of priority being accorded to the preliminary issues here in question.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The general rule is that all the issues in a case are to be tried at one and the same time. There is power to order that differentissues in a case be tried at different times. But that departure from the general rule is ordered only if it is just and convenient.And it is of course for the party who seeks such a departure to demonstrate that it is indeed just and convenient.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> We do not think that circumstances as they existed when this matter was before Mayo J, or as they stand now, demonstrate that thetrial as preliminary issues of the issues which have been ordered to be so tried is just or convenient. The estimates as to how longthe trial of the action as a whole, on the one hand, and the trial of the preliminary issues ordered, on the other hand, would takeare vague in the extreme. So on any view, it is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how much time and costs wouldbe saved if the preliminary issues determined the Telford action. And this is even ignoring. the possibility that the result of theMTR action would render the whole of the Telford action unnecessary. Then there. are the other considerations to which we have alreadyadverted and which point away from the idea that it is just and convenient to order the trial of the preliminary issues sought byShui on. Here we have in mind among other things: (i) the need to proof and call witnesses (who, it might be added, might have tobe proofed and called again when the main trial takes place); and (ii) the delay to the main trial which may be occasioned if theresult of the trial of the preliminary issue is appealed to this Court and possibly even beyond.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> We do not forget that learned Judge had a discretion in the matter. But a careful study of his judgment satisfies us that he overestimatedthe strength of the points in favour of having the preliminary issues. We are likewise satisfied that he did not have regard to allthe points against that course and that he underestimated the strength of those of them to which he did have regard. We have alreadyquoted from his judgment his view of the "very great advantages" of the preliminary issues. Nowhere in his judgment does one finda recognition of its drawbacks.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In our judgment, it has not been demonstrated that it would be just and convenient for the preliminary issues ordered to be triedas such. We think that the learned Judge would not have come to the conclusion which he did if he had taken all the relevant considerationsinto account and given them their due weight.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In these circumstances, we allow the appeal setting aside the Order from which it is brought. We make an order nisi awarding Telfordthe costs here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Before parting with this case, we wish to note in fairness to the learned Judge that he was not assisted in his effort to come tothe right decision by the underestimate which he was given of the time which the preliminary issues would take to try; and we wishto express our indebtedness to counsel who appeared before us, none of whom appeared below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading" style="text-align:center">[Counsel address on costs]</p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The costs below which we award to Telford are the costs below in so far as they are referrable to Shui On's summons for the trialof preliminary issues. Counsel for Shui On has asked us to say so in terms in case it is not otherwise clear; counsel for Telfordagrees that we should do so; and by what we have just said we have done so.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(K.
