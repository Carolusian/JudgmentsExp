Sea Horse had taken over from an Associated Company Interocean Express Ltd. (IEC) who had previously been conductingbusiness with the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Although some of the earlier bills of lading were IEC bills I do not think that it was a matter of great significance that the originaldealings had been with IEC as Mr. Skoczen accepted that to a large extent IEC staff had been seconded to work for Sea Horse.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The main thrust of Mr. Skoczen's evidence was that it was at all times his understanding that the scope of the Defendants' authoritywas limited to the shipment of goods from Hong Kong to United States ports. He accepted a substantial proportion of the goods whichwould be shipped would originate from Southern China but it was his evidence that the goods would be consolidated in Hong Kong andthat in essence the Defendant would assume the role of freight forwarders.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Skoczen was subjected to a searching cross examination by Mr. Jat for the Defendants. He was taken through correspondence whichhad been exchanged and shown Bills of Lading which on their face stated that the goods being shipped had been shipped from NingpoPRC.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> His answers to the questions put to him were generally along the lines that Sea Horse transacted a very large volume of businessand that it was only if attention was specifically addressed to the port of origin that anyone would notice this. The documentationwas in the normal course of events processed by clerical or accounting staff who would not primarily be concerned with the originof goods which had been shipped.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Certainly this was not a matter which would come to the attention of senior management unless the specific issue was raised. Whatneeded to be borne in mind was that Sea Horse had 6 Branch Offices and documents dealt with by a Branch Office would not usuallybe referred to the Head Office at Long Beach California.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Jat put to Mr. Skoczen his fax to the Defendants dated the 22nd June 1987 which dealt amongst other matters with 3 IEC Billswhich on their face stated that Ningpo had been the port of discharge of the cargo. Mr. Skoczen maintained his evidence that he hadconsidered the accounting problems referred to in the fax and that he would have had no reason to personally scrutinise the Billof Lading. This being the case he had not become aware of the shipment under the Bills of Lading from Ningpo.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Jat also referred Mr. Skoczen to the letter he had written to the Defendants on the 22nd November 1988 from which it was evidentthat he had definitely been aware of this fact at the time that the goods had been shipped from Ningpo to Hong Kong. Mr. Jat askedhim why he had not at that stage raised the question of the breach of the terms of the Agency Agreement between the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Skoczen said that he had focused his attention upon trying to obtain the background information which would enable him to providethe Insurers with the information they were seeking. His mind had been focused on the damages which were being claimed and how SeaHorse could deal with any claim being made by the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The next witness to give evidence was Mr. Michael Dugan who is the Chief Financial Officer of Sea Horse. He is also the Presidentof the Holding Company which controls Sea Horse so notwithstanding his title in Sea Horse he would in effect be Mr. Skoczen's superior.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> He gave evidence along similar lines to Mr. Skoczen's and there were no obvious or manifest deviations in their evidence. Mr. Duganhad made 3 visits to Hong Kong and had had meetings with Mr. Arthur Wong of the Defendants. He emphasised that it was at all timesin the contemplation of the parties that goods should be shipped from Hong Kong although he accepted that they might and probablywould originate from China.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He was also cross examined on the correspondence I have referred to when commenting on Mr. Skoczen's evidence. He said that Sea Horse'smain concern was to find a solution to the problem which was being encountered and that attention was focused on how damage had occurredto the cargo rather than upon whether there had been a breach of the terms of the Agency Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I found both Mr. Skoczen and Mr. Dugan to be excellent witnesses. I had no hesitation in accepting their testimony.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Captain Brown a Marine Surveyor gave evidence concerning the survey he conducted at Charleston South Carolina of the 606 cartonscontaining polyester cotton yarn which had been stuffed into the container in Hong Kong. It will be helpful to refer to the conclusionswhich were reached by him in his Report.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"NARRATIVE REPORT</p>        <p class="quote">It is our understanding that the shipment had been consolidated from various suppliers at the port of Ningbo, thence forwarded bybreak-bulk vessel to Hong Kong. It had then been discharged to barge before being loaded into containers for shipment via "YAMATAKAMARU" to Charleston.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">On receipt at Commercial Bonded Warehouse, no damage had been sighted to the container and exceptions noted on truck waybills relatedonly to physical condition, ie., "Mashed, torn, contents exposed". However, a strong odor of mildew was noted that was subsequentlyshown on warehouse receipts issued.</p>        <p class="quote">At the time of survey, the containers had been stripped and the goods were in store in the warehouse. Packing consisted of double-facedcorrugated fiberboard cartons, each 51 x 51 x 72 cms with gross weight 114 lbs. and net weight 100 lbs. The yarn was wound on fiberboardcones, individually wrapped in polyethylene.

The conclusions he reached and the action he took was not dissimilar to the evidencegiven by Captain Brown.</p>    <p>Paragraphs 11 and 12 of Captain Wray's statement read :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"11. I note that the cargo was said to be first carried break bulk on the "LIN JIANG" from Ningbo (loading dated 25th December 1987)to Hong Kong (arriving 30th December 1987) and there discharged by lighter and containerized on 2nd January 1988, to be carried aboardthe "California Jupiter". I found no sign of any heavy wetting of the cargo which could have been a possible cause of damage hadthis occurred a considerable time before stuffing. The sound condition of the containers suggests that no water could have enteredthe containers to damage the goods following containerization. The cartons tested negative for a sea water wetting. The damage isindicative of the yarn coming into contact with moisture conditions. The most probable cause of this is fresh water wetting of thecardboard cartons in which the yarn was stored at sometime before stuffing in Hong Kong. The most likely cause of damage is thatlight rain fell on the cargo probably shortly before containerization and as the hatches on the "LIN JIANG" would presumably havebeen sealed for the voyage from China to Hong Kong the most likely time of wetting of the cartons was during or following dischargefrom the "LIN JIANG" at Hong Kong, prior to containerisation. Consequently, some partial drying out of the cartons would be possible,but cardboard is hygroscopic, i.e., it is able to hold (and give out) relatively large quantities of moisture. As the containerswere sound, moisture introduced would not be able to escape. The moisture then absorbed by the cardboard cartons would be releasedwithin the containers during the ocean voyage giving rise to high humidity conditions. The damage is indicative of the yarn cominginto contact with this diffusion and condensation of moisture. In the presence of such humidity, mold growth would be encouraged.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">12. In light of the damage, on instructions from insurers we sent out invitations to bid to 27 salvors known to us, for the 116,400lbs of yarn remaining after Mr Meisel's test. The best offer received was from Saw Mill International Corporation of New York beingUS$0.7327/lbs (US$85,286.28 total), (see pages 30-34 of "ABW-I"). Assuming the 4,800 lbs (48 cartons) used for testing suffered anequal diminution in value i.e., US$0.7327/lb that value amounts to US$3,516.96. Given a sound market value of US$2.25/lb which wasascertained on enquiry, a loss of US$183,896.76 arose from the damage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> While taking cognisance of the fact that Captain Wray was not subjected to cross examination I can see no legitimate reason not toattach considerable weight to his evidence. I say this as his statement and survey have obviously been carefully prepared and itis noteworthy that in important respects his evidence corresponds to the evidence given by Captain Brown.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The main witness for the Defendants was Mr. Arthur Wong. He said that he is effectively the owner of the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> He described the business relationship which had developed. Initially, that is in 1984, it had been with Mr. Robinson of IEC. Hesaid that at the end of 1986 there had been a reorganisation of IEC, and its Associated Companies Western Overseas Corporation andSea Horse.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The end result of this had been IEC's freight forwarding business was taken over by Sea Horse and Western mainly did business asa Customs Broker.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In early 1987 he had met Mr. Dugan who had represented himself as the President of Western and who was in charge of Sea Horse. Mr.Skoczen was responsible for the day to day business.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> He claimed that when he had met Mr. Dugan he had outlined his modus operandi and had made it clear that he obtained goods from Chinaand arranged for their shipment in containers to other parts of the world.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Besides the relationship with IEC he had not shipped goods to United States ports as the Defendants were not NVOCCs. He was awareof the regulations laid down by the F.M.C. and knew that Sea Horse was an NVOCC. He also knew that if goods were shipped to UnitedStates ports freight rates had to be in accordance with the Tariff laid down for this. Mr. Dugan had appeared to be keen to developa business relationship with the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Wong's evidence concerning the supply of blank IEC and Sea Horse Bills of Lading forms was similar to the Plaintiffs' evidence.He also accepted he had signed the 2 Indemnity forms referred to but claimed that he had not read them before doing so. I did notattach any great weight to this as the forms were-principally designed to protect Sea Horse from misconduct on the Defendants' part.I do not think that the Defendants' conduct amounted to the sort of matters covered by the Indemnities.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> What is of more importance was Mr. Wong's evidence in relation to the letter of Authority I cited earlier in this judgment. At firstMr. Wong attempted to claim that as the document was addressed to "To whom it may concern" it was not really intended to govern therelationship between the Defendants and Sea Horse.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> When pressed by Mr. Fok in cross examination he accepted that the authority was clearly limited to cargoes shipped from Hong Kongand that he had not taken any steps to inform Sea Horse that the authority did not accurately reflect the business discussions heclaimed to have had with Mr. Dugan.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Even more unsatisfactory than this was Mr. Wong's evidence concerning the practice adopted for issuing Bills of Lading when goodswere shipped from Ningpo.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> He accepted that on account of the matters he referred to in paragraph 12 of his statement of evidence that there was a higher riskinvolved in shipping goods from PRC ports. Notwithstanding this the Bills of Lading had been issued by a member of his staff in HongKong when there had been no sufficient opportunity to inspect goods before they left Ningpo. He also reluctantly accepted that thestatement on the face of the Bills to the effect that they had been issued in Ningpo was false. He did not though think that he haddone anything wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Also Mr. Wong's evidence concerning communications with Sea Horse left much to be desired. He agreed that when eventually in April1989 Sea Horse had claimed that the Defendants had been in breach of the terms of the Agency Agreement between them he had at notime denied this although he had written to Sea Horse claiming that he was doing all he could to resolve the situation.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr. Gary Choy, the Operation Assistant of the Defendant gave evidence concerning the system adopted. His evidence was in conformitywith Mr. Wong's. I regret that it reinforced the impression I had gained that the Defendants adopted a somewhat cavalier approachto documentation and were prepared to make statements without too much regard for their accuracy. That is not to suggest that I foundMr. Choy to be an untruthful witness.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> I have provided a brief summary of the evidence of the main witnesses. It is of course also necessary to consider the backgroundcorrespondence.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I have already referred to what I regard as being the most important document namely Sea Horse's letter of the 16th June 1987 whichI am satisfied set out the basis of the Agency Agreement between Sea Horse and the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> It is also of importance to consider the correspondence which was exchanged between the parties at the time when it was agreed thatSea Horse Bills of Lading should be used by the Defendants. I would refer in particular to the letter sent by Mr. Skoczen to Mr.Wong on the 5th July 1987 which was as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5/07/87</p>        <p class="quote">To: Ace Protrans - Attn: Arthur Wong From: Sea Horse Container Lines - Len Skoczen</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Dear Arthur:</p>        <p class="quote">This acknowledges receipt of the two agreement forms which we received by fax on May 6, 1987.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We are forwarding to you today Sea Horse bills of lading for your future use. Please note, however, that we must inform the F.M.C.of your selling rates by commodity before the Sea Horse bills of lading can be issued. We must file the rates in our tariff and submitthem to the F.M.C. forty eight hours in advance of shipment.</p>        <p class="quote">We are sending photocopies of our Hong Kong/USA tariff so you can see the rates we currently have on file. It is imperative that younotify us by fax at least 72 hours in advance of issuing S.H. B/L so we can file tariff rate with the F.M.C. Please note that filinga lower tariff rate for any item that appears in the tariff requires only 48 hours notice but to file an increase of an existingrate requires 35 days notice.

Mr. Wong agreed in his evidence that hedid not in any way query this letter after receiving it and I consider that this is rather strange if his version of the positionis correct. If indeed Mr. Wong had agreed with Mr. Dugan that shipments would be made from PRC ports and that Sea Horse Bills ofLading would reflect this fact it is surprising to say the least of it that Mr. Wong did not raise this issue with Sea Horse afterreceiving the letter dated the 5th July 1987.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> When considering the oral testimony in conjunction with the correspondence it is almost impossible to escape coming to the conclusionthat the Plaintiffs' version of the evidence must be preferred to the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I find it very difficult to believe that either Mr. Dugan or Mr. Skoczen would have countenanced any arrangement whereby Sea HorseBills of Lading would be used for the shipment of goods from PRC ports to ports in the United States of America. Any such arrangementwould require the adoption of Sino Chart rates and with the exception of one letter to the New York Branch Office. This was neverthe subject of discussion or negotiations between the parties.

The argument was that it was or could be the representor who was responsible for ambiguities if the representeereasonably misunderstood what was said to him and acted upon it. The short, and to my mind conclusive, answer to this line of reasoningin the present case is that the ambiguity, if any, in the whole correspondence originated from the alleged representee and not fromthe alleged representor. In such a case, I would have thought that justice, law and common sense demanded that the alleged representorshould not be made to bear any financial loss arising from the ambiguity. To my mind, this also disposes of the entire sequence ofauthority which the appellant sought to pray in aid. But, since the matter is of some general importance, I desire to add some generalcomments upon the authorities and quotations relied on by the appellants. The first of these was a dictum <em>of McNair J. obiter in Marquess of Bute v. Barclays Bank Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20QB%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 Q.B. 202.</a> In the course of a judgment in which he held that a particular representation relied on as giving rise to an estoppel was not clearand unequivocal in the required sense McNair J. is reported as saying, at p. 213: "the representation must be clear and unequivocal<em>or at least reasonably understood to be clear and unequivocal"</em> (italics mine). These words clearly give rise to considerable logical difficulties in exegesis, since, one would have thought, wordsare either clear and unequivocal, in which case they would be reasonably so understood, or not clear or not unequivocal, in whichcase a representee would not be reasonable in so understanding them. However that may be, it is reasonably clear that the words italicisedabove are unnecessary to the decision, and it is therefore for consideration how far, apart from them, there is or was any authorityfor the proposition. The researches of counsel led him to the citation of the well-known passage of Bowen L.J. in <em>Low v. Bouverie</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%203%20Ch%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 3 Ch. 82.</a> But I do not think that this citation bears the weight sought to be placed upon it. Bowen L.J. said, at p. 106:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"... an estoppel, that is to say, the language upon which the estoppel is founded, must be precise and unambiguous. That does notnecessarily mean that the language must be such that it cannot possibly be open to different constructions, but that it must be suchas will be reasonably understood in a particular sense by the person to whom it is addressed."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I am satisfied that, in the second sentence of the above quotation, the meaning is to exclude far-fetched or strained, but still possible,interpretations, whilst still insisting on a sufficient precision and freedom from ambiguity to ensure that the representation will(not may) be reasonably understood in the particular sense required. I do not regard this second sentence as any authority for generalqualification of the first. On the contrary, the first sentence governs the second and contains the very proposition for which Lowv. Bouverie is rightly cited as an authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> It is necessary to bear in mind that in essence the Defendants are placing reliance upon the failure of Sea Horse to notice thatit was manifest from the face of a few of the documents submitted to them that goods were being shipped from Ningpo.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> I accepted the evidence of Mr. Skoczen and Mr. Dugan that Sea Horse process an enormous volume of Bills of Lading.
