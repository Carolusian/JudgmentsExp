The Defendants are a Danish Shipping Line whose registered office is in Denmark but carry on businessin Hong Kong through local agents.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The action arose as a result of two bills of lading dated the 19th August 1969 whereby the Defendants agreed to deliver to the orderof the Plaintiff at Djakarta, Indonesia from Japan 500 units of Honda motor cycles types s.90-11. By a certificate dated the 19thAugust 1969 the Defendants agreed to deliver the goods to the consignee against the surrender of the original bills of lading.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiffs who claim to be the owner of the goods and as holders for value of the bills of lading allege that the Defendantsfailed to make delivery in accordance with the contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Defendants by their defence deny that the property in the goods ever passed to the Plaintiffs and claim that the goods were deliveredto the notify parties in or about October 1969 in Indonesia.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Third Party proceedings have been issued in which the Defendants claim to be indemnified under a letter of guarantee dated the 3rdOctober, 1969 and by a letter dated the 4th October 1969.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Third Party denies responsibility for the letter of guarantee and the letter dated 4th October 1969.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In their reply the Plaintiffs aver that if the goods were delivered to the notify party it amounted to a fundamental breach of theDefendants' obligations to deliver the goods to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Robertson in his affidavit says that the witnesses referred to are material and necessary and that the action cannot safely proceedto trial without their evidence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The managers of the Honda Motor Company Limited are required to give evidence as to the parties to the contract of sale in respectof the goods covered by the bills of lading and as to the true relationship between the Honda Motor Company Limited and the ThirdParty. The evidence of Mr. Fujii is required to explain and clarify the certificate of the 19th August 1969. It is stated that allthese witnesses are at present residing and working in Japan and that they are willing to give evidence on the Defendants' behalfbefore a special examiner in Tokyo. However, it is contended that it would be very difficult for each of the witnesses to attendHong Kong for the trial and that in view of the nature of their evidence it should be taken in Japan. The affidavit concludes witha request that the evidence of other persons whose names are at present unknown but whose evidence is believed to be material andnecessary should also have their evidence taken in Japan.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. Mills-Owens who appeared for the Defendants maintained that he evidence that he wishes to be taken in Japan relates solely tothe issue on contract and that the object of the examination is to demolish the Plaintiffs' claim on this aspect.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The evidence of the witnesses in Japan may be material and necessary to the Defendants' case but whether the application should begranted is entirely a matter for the discretion of the court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Mills-Owens commented upon the Plaintiffs' choice of Hong Kong as the forum of these proceedings and referred to the case ofRoss v. Woodford  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1894%201%20Ch%20P42" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1894 1 Ch. P.42</a> where the court held that in such applications of the present nature it will look more favourably towards a Defendant than towardsa Plaintiff. However, it is significant that the Defendants have not challenged the jurisdiction of this court despite clause 32of the two bills of lading which provides that Danish law will determine all disputes to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of thecourts of any other country.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The facts of Ross v. Woodford can be distinguished from the present application in as much as the Defendants in that case were notpossessed of unlimited means and would have been put to great expense to attend the trial by coming from South Africa to Englandfor that purpose. It could hardly be said that in this case the expense to the Defendants would be great nor could it be said tobe oppressive and unfair for the witnesses named, who hold responsible positions in their respective companies, to come to Hong Kongfor the trial. The Defendants have provided no information with regard to the names of the other witnesses, their positions or theevidence that they are required to give with the result that the application so far as they are concerned fails completely.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In Lawson v. Vacuum Brake Company LR 27 Ch. Division P. 143 Cotton, L.J. said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">'It is most desirable that such a witness should be examined in open Court. If, however, it could be shewn that he could not be inducedto come here, or that the Plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to bring him here, I think it would be tight to give leave toexamine him abroad, and it would be for the Court or the Jury at the trial to determine how far the weight of his evidence was affectedby their not having seen or heard him. But I think that in a case of this sort, where it is important that the witness should beexamined in Court, a heavy burden lies on the party who wishes to examine him abroad, to shew clearly that he cannot be reasonablyexpected to come here. On that point the Plaintiff has failed. In my opinion there is not sufficient evidence to satisfy me thatthis witness cannot be brought here, or will not come here. It is true we are told he is in the service of some company, but we donot know what is the character of his occupation, or whether he would not be able at comparatively small expense to leave for a timehis position there, and come over to this country. In my opinion, therefore, it is not shewn to be necessary for the purposes ofjustice that the examination of this witness should take place in America, and the appeal must be dismissed.'</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Accordingly the onus is upon the Defendants to show clearly that the witnesses cannot be reasonably expected to come to Hong Kong.The affidavit of Mr. Robertson says that it would be very difficult for the witnesses to attend here, but no reasons have been givento support this contention. It is common knowledge that without undue expense arrangements could be made for the witnesses to travelto Hong Kong from Japan by air and for their evidence to be taken the day after their arrival. The expense involved in bringing thewitnesses here could in no way be said to be prohibitive to the Defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Although the Defendants cannot compel the witnesses in a foreign country to attend here, this aspect does not arise, for the affidavitfiled in support of the application shows that the witnesses are ready and willing to give evidence on the Defendants' behalf. Ithas been said that the witnesses are reluctant to travel to Hong Kong for the trial but no evidence has been provided by the Defendantsto this effect nor has an approach been made to the witnesses with a request to come here for this purpose.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I am not therefore satisfied that the witnesses are either unwilling or unable to be present in Hong Kong for the trial. Furtherit is not in dispute that the Defendants have made no effort to obtain the evidence required by other means such as notice to admitfacts, affidavit or interrogatories. Mr. Mills-Owens in answer to this point said it is doubtful whether the matters to be ascertainedare within the knowledge of the Plaintiffs and consequently such an approach would not help. However, I consider that the Defendantsshould have made an attempt before issuing this application.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Cheung for the Third Party posed the question that if an order is not made would the evidence be lost to the Defendants. TheDefendants have not established that the evidence of their witnesses would be lost if I refuse their application.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In the interests of justice between the parties I am of the opinion that the Defendants have failed to show that it is necessaryfor the witnesses to be examined in Japan.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> As a result the Defendants' application will be dismissed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Costs of and incidental to this application will be paid by the Defendants. There will be a certificate for one counsel for eachparty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Dated the 8th day of March, 1971.</p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(B.L.
