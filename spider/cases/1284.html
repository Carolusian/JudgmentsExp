The Plaintiff, Aqsa Rana, was borne on 27 June 1999.  She was aged 5 years and4 months at the time of the accident.  At the date of trial, she was 8 years and 3 months old.  It is the Plaintiffâs case thatthe Plaintiff was crossing the junction of Oi Kwan Road and Tak Yan Street at about 5:14 p.m. on 25 October 2004 after attendingclass at Masjid Amman and Osman Ramju Sadick Islamic Centre (âthe mosqueâ) on Oi Kwan Road when the Defendant driving vehicleregistration No. FN5288 owned by the Defendantâs wife, collided with and knocked down Aqsa.  It is not disputed that the Defendantdrove into Tak Yan Street from Wanchai Road, intending to turn left into Oi Kwan Road at the time.  It is the Plaintiffâs casethat the front of the Defendantâs vehicle hit Aqsa, knocking her down, resulting in the Defendantâs car trapping Aqsaâs rightfoot, injuring her right foot.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  It is the Defendantâs defence that Aqsa did not emerge onto Tak Yan Street from the direction of the mosque on Oi Kwan Road. He claimed Aqsa had emerged from the front of a taxi parked outside the playground on top of Tak Yan Street, run into Tak Yan Street,collided with the Defendantâs car and was knocked down.  The Defendant claimed the point of impact with the Defendantâs vehiclewas the right i.e. offside front fender and the front wheel of the Defendantâs vehicle.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The Plaintiffâs Case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Aqsa and her father Mr. Muhammad Mubhtar did not give evidence at the trial.  The Plaintiffâs evidence came from Mr. Atiq-Ur-Rehmanwho was the religious studies teacher at the mosque.  He told the Court Aqsa and her 2 brothers had been attending the class at themosque on the day of the accident between 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.  He further said that Friday is the main religious day of the weekfor Muslims and classes of religious studies for Muslim children between the ages of 3 to 16 are held weekly on Friday afternoons. 25 October 2004 was such a day.  Across the road on Tak Yan Street is the playground where parents would pick up their childrenafter the religious studies class.  It was Mr. Rehmanâs evidence that as soon as he was informed of the accident involving Aqsahe rushed to the scene, he found blood on the street and Aqsa injured.  He saw the car involved in the accident and the driver andhis wife were a Chinese couple.  He said the Chinese lady told him that she was sorry and it was their mistake.  He claimed the ladywent to the mosque and asked for the phone number of Aqsaâs parents on the next day.  He told her the girl was in hospital andgave her the phone number of the parents.  She phoned the father in Mr. Rehmanâs presence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> witness for the Plaintiff was Mr. Mahmood Sajid who resided at the same address as Aqsa and her parents in Wanchai.  On the day ofthe accident, he was asked by Aqsaâs father to pick up Aqsa and her 2 brothers from the mosque because her parents had a hospitalappointment.  Mr. Sajid said in his witness statement he was waiting for the children to come out from the mosque under a tree outsidethe playground on Tak Yan Street and he was chatting to a friend when the accident took place.  He claimed Aqsa was walking fromthe mosque to the playground on Tak Yan Street, while she was crossing the road at the top of Tak Yan Street to get to the playgroundon the opposite side of the road, the accident happened.  He also claimed that there were many children crossing the road, parentsand their children walking down Tak Yan Street and children playing at the playground on Tak Yan Street.  He admitted there werecars driving up Tak Yan Street and cars parked along Tak Yan Street which is a one-way street linking Wanchai Road and Oi Kwan Road. He claimed, after the accident, Aqsa was trapped under the car tyre, the driver stopped, then reversed his car.  He went up to helpAqsa and carried her onto the pavement. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> witness for the Plaintiff was Mr. Muhammad Hassan.  Mr. Hassan claimed he had just finished praying at the mosque and was walkingdown Tak Yan Street.  He saw many children who had just finished their religious studies crossing Tak Yan Street to the playground. As he passed the entrance to the playground, he saw the Defendantâs car driving at a high speed.  Within seconds, the accidenthappened.  He went up to help Aqsa and found her foot bleeding.  He shouted for someone to call the ambulance and found that someonehad done so.  Later on, the ambulance arrived and took the little girl to the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiff produced medical reports from the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Dr. Richard K.M. Poon, a specialistin Orthopaedics and Traumatology.  Medical chits and referral for physiotherapy treatments for Aqsa were produced under a hearsaynotice.  These have not been challenged by the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The report from Dr. Leung Man Fai, Chief of Service, Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at the Pamela Youde NethersoleEastern Hospital confirmed that Aqsa was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">alert and fully conscious.

He claimed that he had been driving for 22 years and had never been convictedof careless driving.  On the day of the accident, he was driving his wife and himself back to his home in Happy Valley from his officein Wanchai.  He admitted he would drive through Tak Yan Street on his way home on a daily basis.  He was familiar with Tak Yan Streetand Oi Kwan Road.  He claimed he was driving at a speed of 15-20 kmph at the time and there were cars parked along the right sideof Tak Yan Street up to the entrance of the playground on the top end of Tak Yan Street near Oi Kwan Road.  When he passed Tak YanStreet on the day of the accident, there were 2-3 taxis parked on the right side of the street outside the playground.  As he wasdriving close to the 1<sup>st</sup> taxi parked at the top of Tak Yan Street, Aqsa suddenly emerged from the front of the taxi, dashing out into the road.  He immediatelybraked and swerved his car to the left and the child crashed onto the right front part of his car.  He stopped his car and saw apedestrian signalling to him telling him not to move. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  According to Mr. Tsuiâs witness statement, he alighted from the car and saw the little girl at the right front part of his car,her right foot was bleeding.  He also saw a man holding the child and a lady was calling the police.  Soon after, the police andthe ambulance arrived. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At the hearing, Mr. Tsui admitted he did reverse his car after he collided with the girl, then he alighted from his vehicle to lookat the little girl whom he collided with.  He claimed that after the accident he found a dent on top of the front right fender ofhis vehicle.  Other than that, there were no damage to his car.  He claimed he took a picture of the dent on the right fender ofhis car on 10 September 2007, the night before the trial.  He claimed his car had not been repaired since the accident in October2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Defendantâs 2<sup>nd</sup> witness was Ms. Mable Tam Mei Po, a police inspector, who happened to be passing by Tak Yan Street on the day of the accident.  InspectorTam told the Court that just before the accident, she had been teaching at the Lady Trench Training Centre on Oi Kwan Road.  As shewas walking down Tak Yan Street to catch the tunnel bus on her way home, she witnessed a little girl running from her left into theroad emerging from the front of a car parked on Tak Yan Street.  The girl was hit by a car that was coming up Tak Yan Street.  Shealso witnessed this car (registration No. FN5288) reversed for about half a foot to allow the little girlâs trapped foot to bereleased.  She claimed she told the driver not to leave and then she called the police.  She agreed there were a lot of childrenof similar age to the injured child of Indian/Pakistani descent coming out from the park and gathered round the site of the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Findings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  There is a major dispute between the Plaintiffâs and the Defendantâs witnesses on how the accident happened.  According to thePlaintiffâs witnesses, Aqsa was walking from the direction of the mosque to the park on Tak Yan Street, while she was crossingTak Yan Street she was knocked down and injured by the Defendantâs car that was coming up from the Wanchai Road end of Tak YanStreet as it reached the junction with Oi Kwan Road.  According to the evidence of PW2 at the hearing, Mr. Mahmood Sajid, he hadpicked up the children from the mosque and was walking with the children to the park when the accident happened.  He was 2Â½ metresbehind Aqsa and was chatting to a friend on the way to the park.  He did not notice what was happening to Aqsa because he was pre-occupiedand as soon as he realized what had happened he rushed up to the girl, by which time, the vehicle had already stopped moving.  Mr.Sajid admitted he did not see Aqsa crossing the road.  His evidence in Court is somewhat different from his witness statement wherehe claimed he was waiting under a tree at the park on Tak Yan Street for the children to come from the mosque.  He admitted thatthere were a number of cars parked on Tak Yan Street close to the entrance of the playground at the time.  He confessed he did notnotice how fast the Defendantâs vehicle was travelling before the accident, but he claimed he did see the vehicle before the accidentcoming up from Tak Yan Street while he was standing at the junction of Tak Yan Street and Oi Kwan Road chatting to his friend.  Heclaimed there were many children who had come out from the mosque after their religious studies.  Some of them and their parentswere walking behind him on Oi Kwan Road, some were in front of him and some were in the playground and pavement of Tak Yan Street.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiffâs 3<sup>rd</sup> witness Mr. Muhammad Hassan said he had passed the playground when he saw the Defendantâs vehicle coming up the road at speed. He claimed he also saw Aqsa crossing the road when she was knocked down.  By that time, he had already passed the playground andwas some 15 feet away from the entrance when the accident occurred, and he was not sure on which side Aqsa had crossed the road.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Tsui claimed Aqsa had dashed out from the top of the taxi parked outside the playground onto the road when his car drove pastthe entrance.  He claimed he was traveling at a speed of 15â20 kmph at the time. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The evidence of the Defendantâs 2<sup>nd</sup> witness Inspector Tam supported the Defendantâs evidence that Aqsa was crossing the road from the playground side of the pavementon Tak Yan Street when the accident happened. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  As Aqsa herself did not give evidence we have no first hand evidence from the Plaintiff as to what happened from the injured personherself.  The Court is left with the evidence of bystanders who were in the vicinity at the time and the evidence of the Defendant. It is difficult to ascertain which version reflected what really happened at the accident.  It is not disputed that Aqsa and herbrothers had just finished their religious studies at the mosque and they were supposed to be walking from the mosque to the directionof the playground on Tak Yan Street.  On the other hand, the evidence from the Defendant and Inspector Tam was Aqsa had dashed outfrom the playground side of Tak Yan Street emerging from the front of a parked taxi which had presumably blocked her view of theoncoming vehicle on Tak Yan Street.  The illegally parked taxi outside the pavement to the playground entrance presumably also blockedthe Defendantâs view of pedestrians crossing Tak Yan Street from the playground side. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On the other hand, none of the Plaintiffâs witnesses saw the accident.  Mr. Sajid admitted he was chatting to his friend.  Mr.Hassan had walked passed the playground and was some 15 feet away from the entrance to the playground.  As the accident took placebefore the entrance to the playground near the top end of Tak Yan Street, it would not have been possible for Mr. Hassan to havewitnessed the accident which happened behind him.  He admitted in cross-examination that he was looking in the direction of WanchaiRoad when he walked down Tak Yan Street.  Mr. Hassan, however, made an important observation that the Defendant was travelling atspeed, coming up from Wanchai Road to Tak Yan Street before the accident took place.  Mr. Tsui admitted that he was travelling ata speed of 15-20 kmph after turning into Tak Yan Street from Wanchai Road, he did not slow down his vehicle when he drove past theentrance to the playground as he was approaching the junction Oi Kwan Road.  There is ample evidence from all witnesses that TakYan Street was full of pedestrians with about 22-30 children and parents walking down Tak Yan Street on the pavement and in the playgroundnearby. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr. Tsui admitted driving up Tak Yan Street was his routine on his way home in Happy Valley from his office in Thomson Road; hewould turn into Oi Kwan Road from Tak Yan Street.  He was familiar with this area of Wanchai having worked in this area for over20 years.  Because of his familiarity with this area, he must have been aware that there is a mosque on Oi Kwan Road and on Fridayafternoons he would expect children finishing their religious studies coming out of the mosque.  Some of them would be playing inthe playground on Tak Yan Street or parents would be waiting to pick them up in the vicinity of the playground.  This is also anarea where there is a school and a swimming pool.  It is to be expected that there would be children in the vicinity of a playground,and they would be crossing the road and walking down Oi Kwan Road and Tak Yan Street.  It is incumbent upon drivers driving up TakYan Street to take special care because young children crossing the road on their own near the playground are to be expected.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the words of the author of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts p. 182 para. 3-53:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><b>3-53  Anticipating danger</b> A reasonable claimant must not expect that others will always observe due care in their conduct.  âA prudent man will guard againstthe possible negligence of others, when experience shows such negligence to be common.â  Normally, a clamant should, for his ownprotection, keep his eyes open and take proper precautions to guard against the occurrence of an accidentâ¦â¦â</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><b>3-54   Contributory negligence of children</b> Conduct on the part of a child which contributes to an accident will not necessarily be judged in the same light as similar conductby an adult.

A judge should only find a child guilty of contributory negligence if he or she is of such an age as reasonablyto be expected to take precautions for his or her own safety.  This is not an entirely subjective test, because the question is whetheran âordinary childâ of the claimantâs age could be expected to have done any more than the claimant, and an ordinary childis neither a âparagon of prudenceâ nor âscatter-brainedâ.  Theoretically, there is no age below which , as a matter of law,it can be said that a child cannot be guilty of contributory negligence, but in practice it is unreasonable to exact a high standard.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Wong, Counsel for the Defendant, relied on the case of <i>Chan Hwai Yan v.

It is unfortunate that the Defendant failed to heed these guidelines when hewas driving down Tak Yan Street on the day of the accident.  He knew the area well for he drove into Tak Yan Street on a daily basis. He knew there are schools in the vicinity, there is also a mosque and a swimming pool in the area of Morrison Hill.  He admittedhe was maintaining a driving speed of 15-20 kmph after he turned into Tak Yan Street.  15-20 kmph cannot be described as high speedin urban area, but unfortunately, he had failed to slow down his car in a playground and school area and upon reaching the junctionbetween Tak Yan Street and Oi Kwan Road; in particular he failed to keep a proper look out for pedestrians crossing the road at thetop end of Tak Yan Street where a childrenâs playground is situated.  He knew very well there were a lot of children in the areafor he admitted he saw children walking down Tak Yan Steet.  According to the Plaintiffâs and the Defendantâs witnesses, therewere at least 20-30 children at the junction of Oi Kwan Street and Tak Yan Street and in the playground, yet he failed to slow downhis vehicle as he approached the junction to Oi Kwan Road where children coming from the mosque were expected to cross the road inthe direction of the playground.  I find the Defendant negligent and is liable for the accident. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Contributory Negligence</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  As to whether Aqsa had contributed to the negligence, one has to look at the circumstances that led to the accident.  Given thepositions of various witnesses at the time of the accident, it seems to me that Inspector Tam gave a more credible version of whathappened at the accident even though it may not be logical for Aqsa to be running back from the playground to the direction of themosque by crossing the road from the playground to the mosque side of Tak Yan Street.  Examining the photographs showing Aqsaâsinjuries and comparing them to the description in the medical reports of her wounds from doctors who attended to her at Pamela YoudeNethersole Eastern Hospital and from Dr. Richard Poon, her injury was on the outside of her right ankle.  The photographs on pages110D-110E showed the post-operation scars covering the front middle part of her right foot stretching from the outside of the anklearea.  Para. 3 of the report of Dr. Leung of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on p. 88 said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">A 3 x 3 cm skin defect was found over her right foot dorsum.  â¦â¦ There was no other injury.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  According to para. 2 of Dr. Richard Poonâs medical report (p. 91) he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">According to her father, Ms. Rana sustained injury to her right ankle and foot when a motor vehicle ran over the foot, causing herto collapse onto the ground.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">According to the report by Dr. Leung Man Fai, her right foot was trapped by the car wheel.

The torn and ripped skin on the dorsum of Aqsaâs right foot close to the outside of her ankle would suggestthat the car had come from her right side and the wheel ran over the top of her right foot, her outside foot, which had stepped forward. If she had, as claimed by the Defendant, dashed out from the front of the taxi on the right side of Tak Yan Street outside the playground,the injury would either be on the outside left ankle or the inside of the right foot.  I have invited Mr. Wong Counsel for the Defendant,to explain why Aqsaâs injury was on the outside of her right ankle.  Mr. Wong suggested that Aqsa might have been walking towardsthe Defendantâs car when she collided with the Defendantâs vehicle.  He further proposed that she might have even been playinghide and seek at the time and was running into the Defendantâs car from the front end.  However there were no such evidence tosuggest Aqsa was playing hide and seek at the time of the accident or running down Tak Yan Street from the top end.  The evidencefrom the Defendant was, she had dashed out from the front of the taxi after the Defendantâs vehicle had passed her and she collidedwith the right front fender of the Defendantâs car.  The Defendant also produced a photograph of his car taken 3 years after theaccident that showed a dent on the top of the bonnet.  He claimed the dent was caused by Aqsa during the collision.  Mr. Wong wasunable to explain how a dent could be caused by 5 years old girl who collided with the front offside and right wheel of the Defendantâscar.  There was no dent on the front right fender of the Defendantâs car at all.  I find the evidence of the photograph taken 3years after the accident highly suspicious and of no probative value whatsoever.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Judging from the injury on Aqsaâs right foot, it is highly likely that her injury was caused by the effect of the front wheelof the Defendantâs car running over her right foot.  It is also likely that the injury was made worse by the Defendant backinghis car without first checking on Aqsa after the collision.  Mr. Tsui admitted he did not step out of his car before reversing hiscar.  It is likely that by reversing the car the tyre on his car could well have caused further injury to Aqsaâs right foot trappedunderneath the car causing the skin on top of the right foot to be ripped and torn off.  That can be the only possible explanationwhy Aqsaâs right ankle was injured on the outside when she ran from the playground side of Tak Yan Street onto the road.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In considering whether Aqsa had contributed to the negligence, the Court must look at her age, the circumstances of the case andthe knowledge of the child to the dangers to which the Defendantâs negligence had exposed her.  Aqsa was 5 years old at the timeof the accident, she was not as young as the infant in the <i>Yuen Yan Ting</i> case but she was younger than the child in the <i>Chan Hoi Shan</i> case.  In the C<i>han Hoi Shan</i> case, the driver had the right of way because the traffic light was against her when Chan Hoi Shan crossed the road.  In the presentcase, there was no traffic light and no pedestrian crossing at Tak Yan Street, it is a stretch of road where pedestrians would beexpected to cross close to the junction with Oi Kwan Road and children are known to cross on their way to the playground.  It isundisputed that a 5 years old child would not have appreciated the danger on the road as an older child might have; furthermore,this is in a quiet school area where children with their parents are seen in the vicinity, this may have given her a false impressionof safety crossing Tak Yan Street even if she had emerged from the top of a parked taxi outside the playground on Tak Yan Street. For this reason, I find the contributory negligence from Aqsa is no more than 20%.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Quantum</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Pain, Suffering, Loss of Amenities</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Aqsa received 2 operations on her right foot.  She was hospitalized between 25 October 2004 and 13 November 2004.  Her right footand ankle were supported in a cast when she was discharged.  According to Dr. Poonâs report (p. 91), the cast was changed fromtime to time and there were recurrent discharges from the wound.  The cast was eventually removed after 3 months. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Due to the thickness of the skin graft, a further operation might be required as Aqsa become older to ensure more stable and durableskin coverage over the right ankle and foot.  According to Dr. Poon, it had taken one year of repeated dressing changes before thewound finally healed up completely in February 2006 after Aqsaâs last follow-up in February 2005.  During this period she had problemswalking properly and going to school.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Aqsa is now left with an unsightly scar on the right ankle and foot, mild hypersensitivity at the skin graft donor site in the rightthigh and pain in the bone under the grafted site on rough contact.  This scar from the donor site is 8 cm x 7 cm and the scar onthe right ankle and foot is 16 cm x 5 cm.  The area over the right ankle and foot is now healed and she has normal right ankle andfoot function.  According to Dr. Poon, âthe grafted area is pigmented, unsightly and anaesthetic, and will probably remain so asshe grows up.  The split thickness skin graft is also less durable than normal or full thickness grafted skin because it lies overmostly bones and ligaments rather than muscle, and across the ankle joint which stretches, compresses and twists with each motionmaking it even less durable and more susceptible to breakdownâ.  That was why her doctor had advised a replacement with the skinflap to ensure more stable and durable skin coverage.  In Dr. Poonâs estimation, the skin flap procedure requiring the expertiseof a plastic surgeon done at a private hospital would cost in the region of $40,000.  The scar would likely be more extensive followinga skin flap procedure, which will add to the scarring on Aqsa.  The unsightly scar in the right ankle and foot and the donor regionwould be socially awkward when she puts on shoes without socks, during swimming and in communal changing rooms.  She will also notbe expected to pursue a career as a photographic or fashion model or jobs that require a normal looking ankle and foot.  Dr. Poonassessed in the light of the loss of muscle bulk in the right calf, disfigurement caused by the grafted area and its possible futureproblems, there is a 8% impairment of the whole person resulting from the traffic accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr. Beel accepted that the Plaintiffâs injury cannot be categorized as  âserious injuryâ defined in the case of <i>Lee Ting Lam</i>.

There were 2further thickened and pigmented scars on her upper right arm.
