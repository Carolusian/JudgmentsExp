The purpose of adducing the evidence is in support of thestriking out order (made by the judge) on the ground that some of the plaintiffsâ claims are barred by limitation. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The reasons for our refusal of leave can be briefly stated.  The judgeâs ruling is in relation to a striking out, and it is onlyin plain and obvious case that this drastic measure is justified.  If the judge were wrong (as the plaintiffs contend) in his rulingon the evidence before him, it would not be just to the plaintiffs to allow the defendants to adduce fresh and additional evidencein support of a wrong ruling, especially when there is no respondentsâ notice to raise any point so in support.  Moreover, allowingthe fresh evidence would entail the plaintiffs putting in other fresh evidence to counter the points to be made by the defendants. In any event, the fresh evidence proposed to be adduced would be subject to different interpretations by the parties and thus maynot have any significant bearing on the outcome of the appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffsâ claims</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> There are essentially four causes of action pleaded by the plaintiffs against the defendants, namely, (a) dishonest assistance inthe breach of fiduciary duties and trust, (b) dishonest breach of fiduciary duty, (c) breach of duty and (d) negligence. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The main allegations in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim (âRASCâ) that was struck out by the judge are summarised in the followingparagraphs. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Agricultural Bank of China (âthe Bankâ) or its various branches intended to invest in a joint venture project with Chio Ho-Cheong(âChioâ) in buying various lots of agricultural land at Mai Po, a well-known conservation area, for the purpose of developingthe land into residential premises (âthe projectâ).  It was Chio who approached the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff (âP2â), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, for the project. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 25 September 1991, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (âD1â), a partner of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants (âD2â), was instructed by Chen Jun-Yi (âChenâ), the General Manager of P2, to do all things necessary for theproper prosecution of, and in relation to, the project (para 6 of RASC), including to provide all necessary professional advice onand in connection with various matters which needed to be inquired about before deciding on the purchase of the land, planning restrictionand permission and user (para 9 of RASC) and to make full disclosure of facts known to the defendants (para 9A of RASC).  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff (âP1â), a shell company, was made available by D2, for the purpose of the project.  Chio and Chen became P1âs directors.</p>    <p class="heading">The claims based on dishonesty</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The following circumstances, which are alleged to be highly suspicious, in the purchase of the land are pleaded in various paragraphsof the RASC, and in particular para 36 thereof, in support of the plea that D1 dishonestly assisted the breaches of fiduciary dutyand breaches of trust on the part of Chio and/or Chen.  Asiagreat Limited (âAsiagreatâ) was to sell the land as confirmor toP1.  The agreed price was $187 per square foot.  Asiagreat had just acquired the land at very substantially less than the price veryshortly before selling it to P1.  Asiagreat pressurised P1 to complete the purchase at great speed.  Unknown to the plaintiffs, Chioand his girlfriend, a well-known artiste, Ms Chan Yik Sze, Elsie (âElsie Chanâ), beneficially owned Asiagreat.  Elsie Chan wasintroduced by Chio to D1 in October 1991 as Chioâs girlfriend, prior to 4 October.  Thereafter Elsie Chan attended D2âs officeson one or more occasions in connection with the project.  After portions of the purchase money were sent to Asiagreatâs solicitorsMessrs Albert K K Luk &amp; Co (âAKKLâ), AKKL sent six official receipts dated respectively 7 October, 9 November, 21 November,9 December 1991 and 20 January and 2 March 1992 to the defendants.  These receipts showed AKKLâs Ledger Name (ie AKKLâs clientname) as Elsie Chan.  There was no reasonable prospect that planning permission would be obtained for the proposed development.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The fact that Elsie Chan and Chio beneficially owned Asiagreat features most significantly in the matters complained of.  Para 25of RASC pleads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Chio and Elsie Chan (by Asiagreat) succeeded in defrauding the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff by concealing from the Plaintiffs their improper involvement in Asiagreat and by selling for a total price of HK$515,193,914land which they (by Asiagreat) had purchased shortly before from the registered landowners for a total price of only HK$150,580,144.40and/or in respect of which they knew there was no reasonable prospect of planning permission for development being granted or werereckless as to whether such permission would be granted (â<b>the fraud</b>â).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I adopt âthe fraudâ as bearing the same meaning in the above pleading.  It is pleaded under the particulars of dishonesty inpara 36 of RASC that the highly suspicious facts and matters (referred to in paragraph 7 above)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ <b>did alert</b> the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and would have alerted an honest solicitor in the position of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the likelihood that the transaction involved a fraud on the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff of the character referred to in paragraph 25 above.â (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The fact that the suspicious facts and matters âwere known to D1â is also pleaded in para 37A of RASC.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The judge struck out the plea in para 36 of RASC of dishonest assistance.  His main reasons can be found in the following paragraphsof his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â47. Mr Griffiths SC leading Mr Bullet submitted that in the particulars going to dishonesty as now amended the words lack particularityof actual knowledge and thus absent is the vital ingredient of dishonesty.  I agree.  Awareness of the so-called suspicious factstaken singly and together at best can be taken as inferences of impropriety and no more than that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">54. These pleadings are largely denied in the statement of defence.  But even if taken as correct; it is not pleaded that D1 readand absorbed the contents [of the receipts] and noticed an apparent irregularity.  And why should he?  The money did not come fromhis firmâs trust account but from his client.  More importantly, given his professional obligations owed his client, was that hisfirm received the assignments and documents of title which gave his client what it had paid for; registered and registrable instrumentsthat could secure its interest.  His duty being to his client, that is what he would have been particularly concerned about.  Evenif he was to note the irregularity of a strange name on the trust account receipt (and that is not the pleaded case) enquiry wouldnot have improved his clientâs position which was already secured.  Had he followed up with AKKL he may well have been told: âHowwe deal with your clientâs money is a matter for us and our client.  Mind your own business.â  Such arrangement that may havebeen made may well have troubled AKKLâs auditors were they to have been spotted; that is neither here nor there; certainly it isnot a matter for D1.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">55. The plaintiffs have not in the circumstances, pleaded particulars of knowledge of dishonesty.  The pleadings do not disclose ââ¦a dishonest state of mind, that is to say, consciousness that one is transgressing ordinary standards of honest behaviourâ; perLord Hoffman at p. 807, <i>Twinsectra</i> supra.  And there is nothing in the particulars that goes close to suggesting that this can be repaired by amendment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">56. I find the plea of dishonest assistance discloses no cause of action.  I allow the amendment to paragraph 36 and as amended orderthat it be struck out.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> There are a number of matters in the cited passages that, in my judgment, are wrong.  The knowledge of D1 of the name Elsie Chan(whom he knew as Chioâs girlfriend) on the receipts and his being alerted by that name has been cleared pleaded.  It is unnecessaryfor the pleading to contain an allegation, as suggested by the judge, that D1 read and absorbed the contents of the receipts andnoticed an apparent irregularity.  The effect of that has already been pleaded. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Secondly, at a striking out for disclosing no cause of action, it was not pertinent for the judge to have conjecture what steps D1would have taken to deal with the irregularity that he noticed.  The simple and obvious step to take was for D1 to inform his client,the plaintiffs and the Bank. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Thirdly, the judgeâs criticism that no âparticulars of knowledge of dishonestyâ has been pleaded cannot be upheld.  If thecriticism was directed at lack of particulars of D1âs knowledge of the fraud, the fact that Elsie Chan was mentioned in the receiptsas AKKLâs Ledger Name could very well indicate that the recipient of the purchase money was Elsie Chan, who was known to D1 asChioâs girlfriend, and thus would be very relevant to the likelihood that any reasonably competent solicitor would appreciate orat least suspect that dishonest secret profits that were substantial had been made by Chio (a director of P1) as the purchaser ofthe land through Elsie Chan via the vehicle of Asiagreat by sub-selling it to P1 at a very considerably higher price.  The plea isadequate.  See <i>Barlow Clowes v Eurotrust International Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20All%20ER%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 All ER 333</a>, 341, para 28, per Lord Hoffmann. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> If the criticism was directed at the lack of particulars of 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs own dishonesty, the pleading is clear that D1 had a duty to disclose material facts (the highly suspicious circumstancespointing to the fraud) that came to his knowledge which might affect his clientâs interest: see paras 4-95 to 4-102 of <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, but he had failed to discharge that duty. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Moreover, it is pleaded in para 36 of RASC under the Particulars of Dishonesty that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant <b>ignored such facts and matters</b> and acted in reckless disregard of the rights and possible rights of each of the Plaintiffs.  By reason of the foregoing the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant acted dishonestly. â¦â (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In my view, the pleas that the suspicious facts and matters âwere known to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâ and âdid alert the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâ and that âthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant ignored such facts and mattersâ amount to sufficient particulars of knowledge of the fraud and sufficient particularsof D1âs dishonesty.  I am of the view it was wrong for the judge to have struck out the claim for dishonest assistance on the groundof the RASC disclosing no cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The judge also struck out the plea of intentional and dishonest breach of fiduciary duty.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â77. I come now to the claim founded in intentional and dishonest breach of fiduciary duty; namely, to act and advise oneâs clientin good faith and in the best interests of the client; in particular to <b>make full disclosure of facts known</b>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">78. Arguably, no limitation period runs because of the necessary ingredient of fraud.  But as I have earlier found the element ofdishonesty has not been established.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">79. I allow the application to incorporate this ground but strike it out for disclosing no cause of action.â (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> As I have already held, the judge was wrong to strike out the claim on dishonest assistance, he was also wrong for the same reasonsin striking out the claim of intentional and dishonest breach of fiduciary duty for disclosing no cause of action. </p>    <p class="heading">The claims for breach of duty and negligence - limitation</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The defendants raised limitation against the claims of the plaintiffs who relied on the extension of the time limit under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 26</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Whether the claims founded in breach of duty as solicitors and negligence were time-barred depends essentially on when the plaintiffsfirst came to know that the defendants had failed in their duties to disclose the fraud to them or were negligent for failing todo so, and whether the plaintiffs, with reasonable diligence, could have uncovered the matters material to this cause of action anddamage. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In the Reply, the plaintiffs plead that they did not discover, and could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the frauduntil December 1998 in the course of criminal investigations conducted by the ICAC.  The plaintiff first became apprised of the followingfacts on 15 August 2000 when D1 gave evidence at the Preliminary Inquiry, namely, (i) D1 had received the said receipts, (ii) thereceipts bore the name of Elsie Chan, (iii) D1 had been introduced to Elsie Chan and knew her to be Chioâs girlfriend, and (iv)accordingly, the receipts disclosed to D1 an improper connection between Chio and Asiagreat (para 4(2)(a), (d) and (e) of the Reply). There is no positive fact to gainsay these allegations.  Thus, for the purpose of striking out, there is apparently a sound casethat D1 had concealed those facts or one or more of them from the plaintiffs all along.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The judge dealt with the matter in some detail:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â63. In support of their contention that the plaintiffs lacked the requisite knowledge until August 2000 an affidavit was made byHuang Zhuyong.  I have already referred to him; he emerged from the Guangdong Branch of the ABC [the Bank] to be made managing directorof both of the plaintiffs following Chenâs departure from the bank in later 1992.  By then the land in question had been bought. Mr Huang came to know almost immediately that the original landowners had sold to Asiagreat at a much reduced price from that paidby the bank.  Between then and 1999 various consultants and experts were engaged to write environmental impact and other studiesconcerning and going towards the ultimate objective of a rezoning of the land; all, it finally transpired by September 1999, to noavail.                       </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">64. Meanwhile, in January 1997, Chio having failed to pay for his allotted shares in P1 and both Chen and Chio having failed adequatelyto assist in Pâs objectives, the share capital in P1 was adjusted to reflect the actual contributions made, and Chen and Chio wereretired from their directorships.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">65. Mr Huang went on to state that in December 1998 he first learned of an ICAC enquiry into a fraud which concerned Asiagreatâsinvolvement in the transactions as middleman, and implicated Chio and Elsie Cha.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">66. One wonders who if not the bankâs officers initiated the investigation.  That has not been revealed in the pleadings or evidence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">67. In any event, according to Mr Huang, this was the first indication that: âthe plaintiffs or anyone in the bank (other than Chenand Chio) had been informed that a fraud had been practised on them through the vehicle of Asiagreatâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">68. The evidence adduced by D1 at the preliminary hearing which followed, primarily goes to the issue of the trust account receiptsfrom AKKL already traversed.

According to my firmâs records only two such receipts were received.  I do not recall examining such receipts personally, anddo not believe I would have done so and the name âElsie Chanâ did not mean anything in particular to me prior to the commencementof these proceedings.  Such receipts are clerical matters which normally would be filed and dealt with by clerical staff.  Such receiptsrelated to monies the receipt of which had already been formally acknowledged in the executed agreement, so there was no reason togive them particular attention.</p>            <p class="quote">18.

If she was ever introduced tome as Elsie Chan I failed to register that fact.  I never realised and it was not made apparent to me that Ms Chan had any involvementwith Asiagreat or the land.

The knowledge of the high cost and the impossibility of rezoningcannot reasonably by themselves give rise to a suspicion of the existence of a fraud that secret profits had been made in breachof fiduciary duties, but rather they would just indicate a bad deal.  <i>A fortiori</i>, these two matters would not reasonably have given rise to any suspicion that D1 knew of the fraud but concealed it from and didnot disclose it to the plaintiffs, which is the basis for the claim on breach of duty as a professional adviser and negligence. The facts alleged against the defendants being unknown to the plaintiffs until 15 August 2000 consist of not only D1âs knowledgeof the receipts bearing Elsie Chanâs name, but more importantly that D1 knew that Elsie Chan was Chioâs girlfriend at the materialtime.  This latter fact could not have been discovered by the plaintiffs until D1âs own admission, even if the plaintiffs had exercisedreasonable diligence in making enquiries.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It may be argued that by the end of 1993, when Mr Huang was sent by the Bank to Hong Kong to take over the handling of the affairsrelating to the project from Chen, if Mr Huang (and the Bank) had exercised reasonable diligence he should have made enquiries whichcould have uncovered the fraud and the breach of duty or negligence of the defendants.  However, as matters presently stand I amnot certain that it is impossible or hopeless for the plaintiff to prove the contrary.  To put it another way, the defence of limitationis not so âmanifestly and immediately destructive ofâ the plaintiffsâ claim under this head, per Sir Sebag Shaw in <i>Ronnex Properties v John Laing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20QB%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 QB 398</a>, 408A as adopted by Godfrey J in <i>Lam Kee On v Lam Hing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20HKC%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 HKC 317</a>, at 320B.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> For the reasons I have set out above, I also consider that the judge was wrong to hold that âthere is nothing I find to promotethe prospect of deliberate concealment by the defendantsâ and that âthe plaintiffs could in 1993 by exercise of reasonable diligencehave discovered the fraud and the fraudstersâ (para 74 of his judgment).</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The plaintiffsâ pleaded case, as supported by the evidence of Mr Huang, is that they only realised the involvement of D1 (and soD2) giving rise to the claim of breach of duty and negligence at the earliest on 15 August 2000, and that even with reasonable diligencethey could not have discovered the defendantsâ involvement.  In my judgment, this is not a clear and plain case that the claimis unarguably barred by limitation or that it ought to be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, with an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiffs have the costs of here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Cheung JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I agree with Woo VP that the appeal should be allowed and the action should proceed to trial.

While there are passages in the judgment which may suggestthat the judge had also evaluate the strength of the plaintiffsâ case, it was clearly not the case.  In any event that task shouldbe left to the trial.</p>    <p class="heading">The principle</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> On the requirement of pleading dishonesty I would respectfully adopt the judgment of Lord Millett in <i>Three Rivers District Council and Others v. Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No. 3)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 AC 1</a> at 291 and 292:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â184    It is well established that fraud or dishonesty (and the same must go for the present tort) must be distinctly alleged andas distinctly proved; that it must be sufficiently particularised; and that it is not sufficiently particularised if the facts pleadedare consistent with innocence: see <i>Kerr on Fraud and Mistake,</i> 7<sup>th</sup> ed (1952), p 644; <i>Davy v Garrett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%207%20Ch%20D%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 7 Ch D 473</a>, 489; <i>Bullivant v Attorney General for Victoria</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%20AC%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] AC 196</a>; <i>Armitage v Nurse</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Ch%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Ch 241</a>, 256.  This means that a plaintiff who alleges dishonesty must plead the facts, matters and circumstances relied on to show thatthe defendant was dishonest and not merely negligent, and that facts, matters and circumstances which are consistent with negligencedo not do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>185     It is important to appreciate that there are two principles in play. The first is a matter of pleading.  The function of pleadingsis to give the party opposite sufficient notice of the case which is being made against him.  If the pleader means âdishonestlyâor âfraudulentlyâ, it may not be enough to say âwilfullyâ or ârecklesslyâ.  Such language is equivocal.  A similar requirementapplies, in my opinion, in a case like the present, but the requirement is satisfied by the present pleadings. It is perfectly clearthat the depositors are alleging an intentional tort.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>186     The second principle, which is quite distinct, is that an allegation of fraud or dishonesty must be sufficiently particularised,and that particulars of facts which are consistent with honesty are not sufficient. This is only partly a matter of pleading. Itis also a matter of substance. As I have said, the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet. But since dishonesty isusually a matter of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted dishonestly, butalso the primary facts which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference. At trial the court will not normally allow proofof primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will not do so in a case of fraud. It is not open to the court to infer dishonestyfrom facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must be <i>some</i> fact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be both pleaded and proved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Dishonesty sufficiently pleaded</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In the present case before the plaintiffs pleaded the 19 matters (which have been summarised by Woo VP at paragraph 8 of this judgment)as particulars of dishonesty, they have pleaded the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âBy acting or continuing to act for the Plaintiffs in respect of the purchase of the land the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) did not act as an honest solicitor would have acted; or</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) acted in a way which was dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and which he himself realized wasdishonest by those standards.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>A number of highly suspicious facts and matters (referred to below) did alert the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and would have alerted an honest solicitor in the position of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the likelihood that the transaction involved a fraud on the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff of the character referred to in paragraph 25 above.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant ignored such facts and matters and acted in reckless disregard of the rights or possible rights of each of the Plaintiffs. By reason of the foregoing the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant acted dishonestly; alternatively, it may be inferred from the foregoing that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant acted dishonestly.  Such facts and matters were: â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In my view dishonesty has been sufficiently pleaded.  There was nothing equivocal about the nature of the plaintiffsâ claim andthe particulars in support of the claim.  The plaintiffs have pleaded, as primary facts, that the defendants knew of the 19 mattersbut chose to disregard them.  From these primary facts the plaintiffs seek to draw an inference of dishonesty on the part of thedefendants.  While the word ârecklessâ has appeared in the plea, it must be understood in its context and does not by itselfoffend the requirement of putting forward an unequivocal plea of dishonesty.</p>    <p class="heading">The receipt</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Much has been said about the fact that the plaintiffs had not alleged that the defendants had read the receipt.  But it is clearfrom the passage I have quoted at paragraph 34 that the plaintiffsâ pleaded case was that the defendants had knowledge of the receipt.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As Peter Gibson LJ observed in <i>Rigby v. Decorating Den Systems</i> (Hearing date: 15/3/1999):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt does not seem to me a necessary requirement for a pleading of this nature, where it is quite clear that fraud is being allegedand where the pleading expressly states that the defendants had the relevant knowledge, that particulars of knowledge must be given.That to my mind is sufficient to enable the plea to withstand an application to strike out.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On this basis, the judge was wrong to strike out this cause of action.  In any event, the defendants accepted that they have not askedfor particulars of the knowledge of the defendants on the receipt.  In the circumstances the cause of action on âdishonestly assistingâshould not be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading">Limitation</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The judge also struck out the cause of action on negligence and breach of duty on the basis of limitation.  The transactions tookplace between 1991 and 1993.  The parties agreed that without the extension the limitation period expired in 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I must say that I am not impressed with the plaintiffsâ case that they only became suspicious and were only able to take actionafter they were alerted by ICAC of the fraud in October 1998 and came to know of the evidence of Mr. Yu at the criminal hearing thathe had received the receipts which bore the name of Elsie Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In my view the objective evidence in this case pointed towards a different direction:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)      The Bank which controlled the plaintiffs were aware in 1993, not merely that it had a âbad dealâ because of the largesums of money that it had invested in the project (over $500 million for some wet-land which could not be developed into residentialbuildings as intended) but also of the unusual feature of the transaction.  This is so stated by Mr. Huang Zhi-yong who was assignedin 1992 to take charge and manage the Bankâs investment which included the Mai Po project.  The Bank had documents which showednot merely the substantial price difference in the two sales but also the astronomical price increase occurred in an extremely shortperiod of time.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)      The Bank was also aware of the relationship between Mr. Chio and Elsie Chan.  The plaintiffs accepted two bank officialswere aware of this relationship: Mr. Foo Shi-feng (to whom Mr. Huang reported what he discovered in 1993 of the huge price differencepaid by the Bank to Asiagreat) and Mr. Leung Kwan Pui (who was the deputy general manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)      The plaintiffsâ present solicitors had no difficulties at all in inspecting the defendantsâ conveyancing file in October2000 in which the receipt to Elsie Chan was discovered.  This receipt, which was so highly placed by the plaintiffs as the key tounravel the true identity of the confirmor vendor, when considered in the context of the knowledge of the Bank, would indicate thatthe Bank could have conducted a proper inquiry at a much earlier time if it was truly interested in finding out the truth. Yet despiteknowledge of the unusual feature and other relevant matters and despite Mr. Huang reporting this matter to his seniors, the Bankhad chosen not to take action in investigating the background of the sale.  The attitude it had adopted was one of âhead in thesandâ response. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     All this becomes even more mystifying when the protagonist here is a bank which is familiar with commercial transactions andwhen it knew it had landed not simply with a bad deal but a transaction with highly unusual features.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I am of the view that based on the present evidence the Bank ought to have carried out a proper investigation in 1993 or at the latestin 1994 when it had failed to obtain planning permission to build residential properties on the land.  However, what is more significantfor the present appeal is whether, if an inquiry should be commenced earlier, the Bank would be able to unravel all the evidenceof the fraud and formulate a proper claim against the defendants before the limitation period expired in 1999.  Bearing in mind thatthis is a strike out application, I cannot at this stage conclude without hesitation that this must be so.  The problems with discoveryshould not be underestimated.  It had taken a criminal investigation agency, namely, the ICAC quite some time before it could lodgea criminal prosecution against those who had defrauded the Bank.  For this reason the extension of the limitation period is an issuethat has to be tried and cannot be properly dealt with in a strike out application.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hartmann J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I agree that the appeal should be allowed.
