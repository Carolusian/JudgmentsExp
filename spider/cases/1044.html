A surgical pad used in this operation was left inside the Plaintiff's abdomen andonly removed by operation over 20 years later on 28th August 1987. The Plaintiff had regsived medical treatment periodically since1975 for abdominal pains.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Defendant did not dispute liability, even though a Defence had been filed, and interlocutory judgment was entered on 30th January1989 for the Plaintiff with damages and interest thereon to be assessed. Subseguent to his assessment being set down for hearingthe Defendant was granted leave to issue third party notices against the three named third parties which gave rise to difficulties.The chronology of the third party notices is set out in the Court of Appeal judgment No.16 of 1990 on an emergency appeal in whichit was ordered that this assessment of damages proceed forthwith without dealing with the issues arising in the third party proceedings.The assessment of damages proceeded as directed by the Court of Appeal and lasted 9 days without any of the Third Parties being representedeven though the first and second Third Parties were called as witnesses at the assessment by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The only issues arising on this assessment and in dispute were, firstly, whether some of the general damages were too remote becauseof the medical treatment received by the Plaintiff over 12 years or in other words whether a novas actus interveniens arose in thecourse of that treatment, and secondly, the measure or guantum of general and special damages to be awarded. The Plaintiff producedan agreed Bundle of 45 Documents comprising 228 pages to the Court, although not all of the contents of such documents were admittedby the Defendant. Plaintiff's Counsel called a total of 6 witnesses including the Plaintiff and her daughter and 4 medical witnesses.The Defendant called 2 medical witnesses. A full record of the evidence has been recorded and it is only proposed to refer to theevidence considered relevant to the issues to be determined.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Plaintiff gave evidence that she has been a widow for over 2 years and is now 70 years of age. She said she was illiterate andis financially dependant on her 6 children. The Plaintiff confirmed she had a gall bladder operation in Queen Mary Hospital in 1967and received follow-up treatment at Sai Ying Poon Clinic on 2 occasions where she had her stitches removed. At that time she saidshe only had a little pain over the area of the wound and was given some medication for the pain. Her evidence is that all alongshe felt a little pain on her side near her stomach. She says that as she was rather busy cultivating vegetables she did not payattention to this pain. She said she supported the family after her operation as her husband was too ill to work and was paralysed.The Plaintiff said the pain she felt after her operation did interfere with her work as a vegetable farmer at Wong Chuk Hang andshe was only able to work when she did not feel the pain. Some years later she gave up vegetable farming and moved to her presentaddress in Wah Fu Estate where she lives with her son and one of her 5 daughters. She was unable to recall the date when this occurred.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Plaintiff said she first went to see Dr. Louis Wong in September 1975 after she was living at Wah Fu Estate. He was the firstdoctor she had seen since the follow-up treatment after her operation in 1967. She said that the pain she felt in 1975 was in thesame area but was more severe and she likened the pain to what she had experienced prior to her gall bladder operation. When shewent to see Dr. L. Wong he told her to have daily injections at his clinic and he prescribed same medicine for her. She went forfollow-up consultations every week. She said this treatment went on for a long time and that the pain usually felt better after shehad the injections. Dr. L. Wong told her that her liver was enlarged and hardened. The Plaintiff said she was unable to do her houseworkor to have a good sleep when she felt severe pain. After receiving this treatment from Dr. L. Wong over a long period she asked himif she could have the daily injections administered at a clinic in the Wah Fu Estate so that she did not have to travel to Dr. L.Wong's clinic every day. Dr. L. Wong agreed to supply her with the drug to be injected and she arranged with Dr. Stephen Soo forthe injections to be administered at his clinic in the Wah Fu Estate. She told Dr. S. Soo that the injections were treatment forher liver and he charged her $3.00 for each injection. The Plaintiff said she never had any consultation with Dr. S. Soo as she continuedto consult Dr. L. Wong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In July 1987 the Plaintiff went to see Dr. S. Soo and Dr. Jack Wong about pain in her chest and abdomen and was referred to Dr. VictorGoh who had her admitted to hospital for 5 days observation in August 1987. After coming out of hospital she felt worse than beforeand Dr. V. Goh referred her for x-rays of her chest and stomach and other tests. Later in August 1987 she was admitted to H.K. Sanatariumand Hospital where Dr. Frank Cheng operated on her and removed the surgical pad from inside her body which was later shown to her.She remained in hospital until 11th September 1987 and received follow-up treatment from Dr. F. Cheng and Dr. V. Goh. She said thatshe still felt pain on her right side even after the removal of the surgical pad. She says that even though it is 2 1/2 years sincethis operation she still feels some pain but that it is an improvement on her previous condition and does not interfere with herhousework or sleep. While in hospital she paid for 3 nurses to give her continuous care and to help her sit up to eat meals and togo to the toilet. She said she took nutritious food in the form of herbs, chicken and psecial tonic for a period of about 1 monthafter her discharge from hospital.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In cross-examination the Plaintiff admitted that no doctor recommended that she took nutritious food. She said that she occasionallyfelt pain and discomfort between 1967 and 1975 but admitted that that pain was not severe and did not occur freguently. The Plaintiff,contrary to her earlier evidence, said she had consulted doctors on a couple of occasions including Dr. S. Soo in 1972 and been givenmedicine for indigestion after he had examined her stomach around the area of her pain where she had the scar of her earlier operation.When she first consulted Dr. L. Wong she says she told him about the pain in her abdomen and her operation in 1967. She was examinedby Dr. L. Wong and sent for chest x-rays and had blood and urine samples taken for tests. Dr. Wong told her that she should haveinjections to cure her enlarged liver which was not functioning well. She received injections every day for a month and was chargedon each occasion. She also took drugs and medicine prescribed by Dr. Wong for pain relief and treatment of her liver. The Plaintiffadmitted her condition had improved by 1982 when she only went to see Dr. Wong every 2 months or so for medicine. She said she hadnot taken a letter from Dr. Wong to Dr. Soo when he started to give her the injections of the medicine supplied by Dr. Wong. ThePlaintiff had never been referred to another doctor by Dr. Soo whom she had seen on different occasions between 1972 and 1987. Similarly,Dr. L. Wong had never suggested she seek a second opinion or referred her to another doctor during the period of his treatment from1975 to 1987. Prior to her admission to hospital in 1987 the only diagnosis of her condition was from Dr. Wong, who told her shehad cirrhosis of the liver which was enlarged.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff was an impressive witness of truth. She answered all questions put to her to the best of her ability without in anyway trying to embellish or exaggerate her symptoms or condition. Any discrepancies between her evidence and that of later professionalmedical witnesses was not of her making, but, likely to have arisen from the translation of questions put and answers made in thecourse of her examination. She is a remarkable woman with considerable fortitude, perseverance and patience which no doubt enabledher to survive this unigue ordeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Dr. Jack Wong (P.W. 2) was called to produce his medical report and records set out at Pages 59 and 60 of the Bundle of Documents.This doctor only treated the Plaintiff once on 30th July 1987 when she complained of gripping chest pains and she was sent for anE.C.G., chest x-rays and blood report and prescribed medicine for a heart condition (angina). Dr. Jack Wong (P.W. 2) was recalledlater and questioned about the chest x-ray he had taken of the Plaintiff On 30th July 1987 (Ex. P.14) and found normal in his reportdated 7th April 1989 at Page 59 of the Bundle. When asked to examine this x-ray film he could not identify any wire of the surgicalpad in the area beneath the diaphragm. When asked to compare the 1987 chest x-ray with the 1975 chest x-rays (Ex. P.7 and P.8) henoticed faint lines on both x-rays which appeared to be metallic wire but said the lines on the 1987 x-rays were very faint. Dr.Jack Wong said he had not seen these lines that appeared to be metallic wire when he examined the chest x-ray film in 1987.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Dr. Stephen Soo gave evidence that he bas a clinic in Wah Fu Estate. He produced his medical report and records relating to his treatmentof the Plaintiff as set out at Pages 101, and 103 to 107 of the Bundle of Documents. In his report Dr. S. Soo said he treated Plaintiffon five occasions between 1972 and 1975 for ailments such as influenza. Furthermore, the report stated that on 14th August 1976 shebrought with her medicine, known as Reticulose, which she wanted him to administer by intramuscular injection on behalf of Dr. L.Wong, who bad prescribed it for her liver condition. He agreed to this request and administered this medicine to the Plaintiff ona regular basis between 14th August 1976 and 11th August 1984. His report also set out details of 3 consultations of Plaintiff from27th to 31st July 1987 for symptoms of a heart condition. An E.C.G. test revealed no heart abnormality. Dr. S. Soo gave evidencethat the Plaintiff had not consulted him in August 1976 when she brought Dr. Wong's medicine to be injected at his (Dr. Soo's) clinic.Dr. Soo said he satisfied himself that the medicine was used in the treatment of liver disease by injection. He says the Plaintiffexplained that it would be more convenient to her to have the injections in his clinic at Wah Fu Estate, where she lived, ratherthan travel each day to Dr. L. Wong's clinic in Kowloon for that purpose. Dr. Soo said these injections were administered mostlyby his nursing staff over the period from 14th August 1976 to 11th August 1984 with varying intervals of days, weeks and sometimesmonths between injections. Dr. Soo saw no reason to stop giving Plaintiff her injections even though she had been receiving samefor such a long period. The Plaintiff told him she benefitted from the injections and she never complained of any ill-effects fromsame.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Dr. Soo was cross-examined as to his standard procedure adopted in consulting a new patient. Dr. Soo denied that Plaintiff had consultedhim between 1976 and 1984 and he also denied treating her over this period. He said Plaintiff merely used his clinic as a place ofconvenience to her to be given her injections. He admitted that as a professional medical man it was his duty to be satisfied thatany treatment given to a patient was proper. Dr. Soo denied responsibility for treating the Plaintiff as she had not sought a consultationfrom him and she was still being treated by Dr. L. Wong. He admitted he had not received a letter of referral from Dr. L. Wong orever spoken with him about the Plaintiff's condition or treatment. This witness was cross-examined at length regarding the treatmentof various diseases of the liver and the use of the drug Reticulose in the treatment of same. Dr. Soo said he was not aware thatthis drug had been withdrawn from the Hong Kong market in 1976. He admitted that another doctor running his clinic in his absenceoverseas had seen the Plaintiff in April 1985 and on 15th January 1986 and the 7th November 1986. Dr. Soo denied that the Plaintiffhad ever complained to him about pain in the right upper guadrant of her abdomen. This witness denied that by giving or authorisingthe giving of injections in his clinic he was treating the Plaintiff. Dr. Soo denied it was improper to treat a patient without firstmaking a diagnosis and using his professional judgment. He admitted having treated the Plaintiff for minor ailments on differentoccasions but denied ever having treated her for a liver condition.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In answer to the Court Dr. Soo said he had never actually prescribed the drug Reticulose which was injected into the Plaintiff athis clinic and that these prescriptions were always made by Dr. L. Wong. He stated that it was not uncommon for patients to seekoutside advice from other doctors and return with the medicine to be administered in his clinic. Dr. Soo stated that he was awareof Dr. L. Wong's good reputation with the public in the treatment of liver ailments and also that Dr. Wong had a specialist qualificationand he did not think it necessary to query his diagnosis of the Plaintiff. He said he was aware from the patient that Dr. Wong hadasked her to find a clinic in the area where she lived to adminster the drug, and he assumed that if he contacted Dr. Wong over thematter, he (Dr. Wong) would think he (Dr. Soo) was taking over his patient.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The next witness called by the Plaintiff was Dr. Victor Goh, a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology. Dr. Goh treated Plaintiffsince 1st August 1987 for pains in the chest area over the heart and pain in her stomach and referred to his consultation notes setout in the Bundle of Documents at Pages 66 and 225. He confirmed that a chronic subphrenic abscess and an abdominal surgical padwas later removed from a space above the Plaintiff's liver. Dr. Goh explained that a surgical pad is a piece of cloth which is muchwider and larger than a surgical swab. The Plaintiff's symptoms of precordial or chest pains were related to the presence of thesurgical pad but this was only found out later. He arranged for Plaintiff to have an E.C.G. on 30th July 1987 and a barium meal x-rayexamination on 25th August 1987 which revealed a lateral calcified lump with metallic content in the abdomen near her liver. Dr.Goh also arranged for Plaintiff to have a C.T. (Computerised Axial Tomography) Scan, which is an extensive computerised x-ray ofthe body in cross-sections, on 27th August 1987. Dr. Goh consulted Dr. Frank Cheng, a gastro-intestinal specialist and surgeon, aboutthe C.T. Scan findings set out in the radiologist's report at Page 6 of the Bundle of Documents. Dr. Goh ordered x-rays of the Plaintiff'schest and abdomen to confirm his earlier findings.  This witness said it was a joint decision by Dr. F. Cheng and himself to operateon the Plaintiff on 28th August 1987. Dr. Goh stated that a sinogram taken after the removal of the foreign body and abscess revealeda cavity the size of a grapefruit where the calcified material had laid (P.25 in Bundle of Documents). A pathology report on theliver tissue, removed during the operation, showed it to be normal (P.23 in Bundle of Documents). Dr. Goh confirmed that the Plaintiffwas still complaining of abdominal pain in the area of her right upper guadrant during her follow-up treatment in the post-operativeperiod. Dr. Goh's consultation notes show that in August 1988 the Plaintiff complained of abdominal pain but that it was less severethan prior to her operation, a year earlier. Dr. Goh said that this pain was likely to have been caused by a gastro-duodenal lesionrather than by fluid collection in her stomach. Dr. Goh's notes confirm Plaintiff complaining on a number of occasions of abdominalpain in same area in April, November, and December of last year and as recently as 23rd January this year. In the second paragraphof his letter of 16th June 1988 (Page 30 in Bundle of Documents) Dr.  Goh stated that the cause of the persistent abdominal painwas likely to be due to the calcified wall of the previous subphrenic abscess which was in the immediate vicinity of the diaphragm.Dr. Goh stated that in the medication prescribed for the Plaintiff since her operation in August 1987 was a pain killing drug toreduce her abdominal pain. Dr. Goh agreed with the statement in Dr. S.T. Fan's report (Page 209 of Bundle) that it was most unlikelythat the existence of a surgical swab or pad over this period of time could cause any heart condition.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In cross-examination Dr. V. Goh agreed that the Plaintiff's symptoms of hypertension and gastro-entro enteritis were not relatedto the presence of the surgical pad in her body for such a lengthy period and that a person of her age would be likely to sufferfrom these conditions. He stated that the Plaintiff's statement that she is suffering less pain since her operation in 1987 is consistentwith her recovery over a long period. Furthermore, he stated that not all the Plaintiff's present pain is caused by the operationor residual tissue as she also has gastric hypersecretion which contributes to her pain. However, Dr. Goh was satisfied that thepresence of a foreign body for such a long time caused calcified tissue to remain in her body even after the operation which resultsin residual pain. Dr. Goh stated that the fibrous tissue sealed off the surgical pad to prevent infection and that after 5 yearsor so the fibrous tissue would begin to calcify and that calcification would be a gradual process from then on. In Dr. Goh's opinionthe fibrous tissue and calcification could have been prevented to a large extent if the surgical pad had been removed much earlier.He also stated that the arching of the Plaintiff's right diaphragm as seen on the x-rays was caused by the fibrous tissue containingthe surgical pad. Dr. Goh confirmed that it was normal practice to seek a second medical opinion when a doctor was not sure of hisdiagnosis and where the condition was outside his field of expertise. In this case various tests revealed that the Plaintiff hada foreign substance in her body so Dr. Goh sought a second opinion from Dr. Frank Cheng before reaching the joint decision to recommendsurgery. When shown the Plaintiff's chest x-rays taken in September and November 1975 (Exhibits P.7 and P.8) for the first time inCourt he said that they were normal except for the right diaphragm being elevated and the presence of linear calcification belowthat. Dr. Goh explained that linear calcification is typically left by the metallic thread in a surgical swab or pad. When Dr. Gohwas asked by Defence Counsel what he would have done after receiving these 1975 x-rays of the Plaintiff, he stated he would haveasked the patient if she had had surgery in the relevant area of her body and, if so, checked with the surgeon responsible on thepossibility of a foreign body being present. Next he would have checked whether any x-rays had been taken of the area of the linearcalcification and whether any such x-rays had been reported as normal. He would have confirmed his diagnosis by x-rays of the abdomenand arranged for surgery to have the foreign substance removed. Dr. Goh said that the 1975 x-rays indicate the presence of an unnaturalsubstance in the body rather than a cancerous mass.  It was Dr. Goh's evidence that if the foreign substance had been removed fromthe Plaintiff's body in 1975 it would be fair to expect the Plaintiff to have much less pain because excessive fibrous tissue reactionand calcification would have been avoided. Dr. Goh confirmed that the cost of the operation to remove the surgical pad in 1975 wouldhave been much less than the same operation in 1987, however, he said it would be difficult to estimate the cost of such an operationin 1975.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> When questioned about a patient asking a doctor to inject medication, Dr. Goh said he would ask the patient why he or she neededthe medication and then discover the nature of the medication to check whether there was any deleterious effect associated with it.He said he would discuss with the patient whether it was to her advantage to have the medication. Dr. Goh said that even if the patientsaid another doctor had prescribed the medication he would not necessarily agree to administer it. Dr. Goh said he considered ithis duty to work out if that medicine was good for the patient or not. He said that the only possible time he would administer medicationto a patient without a full consultation and a physical examination was on the personal assurance by another doctor he trusted andhad confidence in, such as, his professor at medical school, who had assured him that the medication was beneficial and necessaryfor the patient and could be given without a full consultation himself. Dr. Goh said that this is what he would expect from any doctor.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In re-examination Dr. Goh said that if a patient wanted him to inject her with medication he would have told her that it would havebeen in her best interest for him to examine her before doing what the patient requested. He said he would have the right to refusethe patient after his consultation and reaching a conclusion that the medication was not good for him or her. He also said he wouldhave told the patient his reason for refusing to inject the patient with the medication. In answer to a cuestion from the masterDr. Goh said that the injection of the drug Reticulose over a long period of at least 8 years could have potential side effects asthis drug contains nacleic acid (which is a protein derivative) and may cause an untoward reaction to the protein injection soonafter administration. However, Dr. Goh, said that this drug did not cause any severe long term reaction by the Plaintiff and hadnot contributed to the fibrous tissue or the calcification around it in her body. Dr. Goh admitted that this was an unusual casein that the surgical pad left in the Plaintiff's body did not produce a more drastic effect much sooner. For example, if the fibroustissue had broken the foreign substance in the form of the surgical pad would have caused infection leading to peritonitis. Dr. Gohsaid that this was the first occasion he had come across a case where the foreign substance had remained in a patient's body forsuch a long period of time. This witness said that the Plaintiff's chest x-rays in 1975 were unusual because of the arching of thediaphragm and this should have alerted the doctor looking at the x-rays to the possibility of linear calcification being present.Finally, Dr. Gob said that if a patient continued to complain of pain in the abdomen an x-ray of the stomach area should be soughtas it was not usual to examine the abdomen from a chest x-ray. He said that any doctor should have appreciated the Plaintiff's problemafter lengthy treatment of consistent symptoms in the same general area of the abdomen.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Plaintiff's daughter - Leung Yuk Mei - gave evidence that she had written out the receipt for $2,650.00 (Page 58 of Bundle) beingnight shift nursing services rendered to the Plaintiff at the H.K. Sanatarium &amp; Hospital over 5 nights from 28th August to 2ndSeptember 1987 at a nightly rate of $530. She said this receipt was signed by Ho Kit Bing, a registered nurse, after the Plaintiffhad paid over this sum. This witness said that this nurse was engaged for night shift nursing services through the Hospital authoritiesbecause there were fewer nurses on duty at night time. The Plaintiff's daughter said that her mother required 24 hour attention afterher operation as she had lots of tubes attached to her body and she could not eat. Because her mother was so weak at that stage thefamily wanted someone to look after her over-night when there were fewer hospital nurses to care for her than in the daytime. Thiswitness said that when her mother was able to move around, the family employed two nurse attendants through the hospital authoritiesto look after her mother. The receipts for these services are set out at Page 57 of Bundle with one nurse engaged in the daytimefrom the 2nd to 10th September 1987 at a cost of $1,350.00 ($150.00 a day) and the other nurse engaged for the night time from 3rdto 10th September 1987 at cost of $1,200.00 ($150.00 a day). In cross-examination the Plaintiff's daughter admitted that her motherreceived nursing care from staff employed by the H.K. Sanatarium and Hospital both before and after her operation. This witness claimedthat the 3 nurses were employed for her mother out of necessity as the hospital nurses could not provide continuous care at nighttime and her mother was unable to move even to press the bell to summon attention from hospital staff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The last witness called by the Plaintiff was Dr. Louis Wong Cheong Yee whose professional resume was produced as Exhibit P.1. Thiswitness said he had considerable experience in treating patients with liver diseases and that 60% of his patients are treated forliver conditions. Dr. Wong said that the Plaintiff first consulted him on 6th September 1975 but that his consultation notes forthis patient for the period up to the end of 1978 could not now be located as the notes were mislaid in changing his office fromHong Kong Island to his present Kowloon address. Copies of Dr. Wong's available consultation notes dating from 3rd January 1979 onthe Plaintiff are set out at Pages 131 to 192 of the Bundle. This witness was shown and agreed with a table showing that the Plaintiffvisited his clinic on 208 occasions between January 1979 and July 1987 for consultation and/or injection and/or for medicine. TheConsultation Table was produced as Exhibit P.2. Dr. Wong produced on amended Fees Table as Exhibit P.3 showing that the Plaintiffhad paid him a total of $57,870.00 as consultation, injection and medicine fees and charges between 1979 and 1987. The witness estimatedthat the Plaintiff would have paid him more than $30,000.00 as medical fees between September 1975 and December 1978 after takinginto account the annual fees in excess of $9,000.00 paid from 1979 to 1981. Dr. Wong admitted that this figure of $30,000.00 as medicalfees for the earlier period had been suggested by the Plaintiff's solicitors and he agreed with this figure on a pro rata basis withthe 1979 to 1981 period as he could not rely on his memory in the absence of his consultation notes. Dr. Wong was referred to hisconsultation notes in some detail by Counsel for the Plaintiff. He explained that the drugs reticulose and essentiale he prescribedfor the Plaintiff were given by intramuscular and intravenous injection respectively for her liver condition. On a number of occasionswhen Dr. Wong examined the Plaintiff he found and recorded in his notes that her liver was enlarged and tender because she complainedof pain when pressed on the liver. This witness stated that he gave the Plaintiff a full and thorough clinical examination at herfirst consultation in 1975 and that he noted her old scar on the right side. At this examination the Plaintiff complained of painand Dr. Wong said in evidence that he found she had a very enlarged liver. He was able to remember details of his examination evenwithout his misplaced notes because she was a special patient as far as Dr. Wong was concerned. The witness was referred to his letterdated 5th June 1989 to the Plaintiff's solicitors at Page 128 of the Bundle which sets out details of his treatment of the Plaintiffsince 1975. In evidence Dr. Wong said that this letter was not 100% accurate. Dr. Wong was shown 3 x-ray reports dated 8th September1975, 1st November 1975 and 17th June 1982 from the Flite x-ray service which he produced as Exhibits P.4, P.5 and P.6 respectively.He also produced the respective x-ray films as Exhibits P.7, P.8 and P.9. Dr. Wong confirmed that these x-ray films were taken ofthe Plaintiff on the respective dates at his request and that the x-ray reports related to her. Dr. Wong was referred to the chestx-ray of the Plaintiff taken on 8th September 1975 (Ex. P.7) and he said this was requested after the first consultation to ruleout whether or not the Plaintiff had a chest infection because her main symptoms were fever and accompanying signs of infection ingeneral. Furthermore, Dr. Wong said that his second reason for obtaining the chest x-ray was that it was his practice to do so wherepatients were suspected to be suffering from serious liver disease, such as liver abscess or liver cancer. He said that he did thisin these cases because the only part of the body where you can see if there is anything under the disphragm on the right side whichmay be protruding up to the lung is from a frontal chest x-ray. When referred to the x-ray report dated 8th September 1975 from the Elite x-ray service (Ex. P.4) Dr. Wongagreed with the findings that both lungs were clear, that the heart itself was not enlarged, and that the aortic arch was prominentwith calcification seen along its wall. He disagreed with the finding in this report that the diaphragm was negative and said thatthis was not correct in his opinion because clearly the right side of the diaphragm was elevated in comparison with the left side.Dr. Wong was that it was important for him to see if there were any inflammatory changes over the diaphragm but that none had shownup on this chest x-ray and that there was no evidence of chest infection which may have accounted for her condition. He said thatthe elevation and smoothness of the diaphragm on the right side confirmed that the liver was enlarged. After examination of thisx-ray Dr. Wong said that he probably came to the conclusion in 1975 that the Plaintiff did not have a liver cancer bulging out ofthe diaphragm. This witness said that judging from this x-ray alone it was difficult to say whether or not there is an abscess ofthe liver as the right lung does not show inflammatory changes and there was no indication of reactive effusion or fluid above thediaphragm on the right side which would have been signs of a liver abscess. Dr. Wong ordered a second chest x-ray in November 1975soon after the first one to check the area of the diaphragm again. He agreed with most of the findings of the Elite x-ray servicereport (Ex. P.5) and, in particular, the finding that the right side of the diaphragm was elevated and that there is a linear fibroticshadow shown in the middle zone of the right lung indicating a healed old scar. Dr. Wong said that there was pinimal difference betweenthe September and November chest x-rays taken in 1975 and he would have interpreted both in a similar way. This witness said thatin his memory the diagnosis of the Plaintiff's condition was one of the most challenging he had ever had and he would not have reacheda firm diagnosis even after inspecting the second chest x-ray. Dr. Wong said that the Plaintiff's symptoms did not fit any of theestablished patterns and she did not show any signs of liver cancer in her blood and other tests at that stage.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Dr. Wong was referred to 2 test reports on the Plaintiff in 1977:</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="75%">        <tr>            <td width="25%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right">(1)    </p>            </td>            <td width="75%" valign="middle">                An ultrasound test report dated 31st March 1979 (produced as Exhibit P.10) to detect any lesion inside the liver.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="75%">        <tr>            <td width="25%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right">(2)    </p>            </td>            <td width="75%" valign="top">A radio-isotope scan performed at Queen Mary Hospital on 6th April 1979 (produced as Exhibit P.11). Despite the findings of thesereports and all available medical technology Dr. Wong said that he could not make a proper diagnosis of the Plaintiff's conditionby 1979. He said that while the finding of the ultrasound test was indicative of cancer of the liver this had been excluded at anearly stage and confirmed by the Plaintiff surviving for a considerable period of time. Furthermore, Dr. Wong said that by 1979 hehad more or less excluded the 2 types of liver abscess as possible causes. </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Dr. Wong was referred to a spinal x-ray film taken on 17th June 1982 after the Plaintiff had complained sciatic pain in her lowerback. This x-ray film was produced as Exhibit P.9. In his evidence Dr. Wong said that he noticed two most unusual features, firstly,calcification of the liver and, secondly, something that looked like a handle of wire in the patient. As a result of this he saidhe eventually persuaded the Plaintiff to have a computerised axial tomography scan on a modern x-ray pachine which uses a computerto formulate pictures of a cross-section of a particular area of the body every few centimetres or so. Dr. Wong produced the C.T.Scan Heport as Exhibit P.12 and 4 films accompanying same as Exhibit P.13 and stated that the report findings that "there were 2large cysts surrounded by calcific rim and demonstrated in the right lobe as well as the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver"confirmed his diagnosis that the Plaintiff had polycystic disease of the liver. He said that this finding was consistent with theresult of radio-isotope scan. Dr. Wong said that he had formed this diagnosis that the Plaintiff had polycystic disease of the liversome time between 1975 and 1979 but had not been able to prove it at that time. Dr. Wong said that polycystic disease of the liverwas a very rare condition and that a doctor is not on safe ground in making such a diagnosis, which would normally only be made duringan autopsy or in the course of operating on the patient. He said that polycystic disease of the liver is a developmental defect atthe foetal stage but the symptom only appears when the patient is 40-50 years of age. Dr. Wong said that after confirming his diagnosisby the C.T. scan the Plaintiff did not require treatment even though she would suffer discomfort and pain as there is no method totreat such an abnormality. He said that the regular injections of reticulose was not given as treatment for polycystic disease ofthe liver. He said he probably prescribed this drug to treat the Plaintiff's liver but that it does not cure a liver condition. Dr.Wong said that the first few times he used reticulose the Plaintiff responded dramatically with reduction in pain and with a goodclinical response. He admitted that he could not find an adequate diagnosis for all the Plaintiff's symptoms, namely, that she hadan enlarged and tender liver, and that his diagnosis of polycystic disease of the liver only fitted the clinical aspects of her condition.This diagnosis did not account for the tenderness of her liver for which he treated her by injecting the drugs reticulose and essentialeas they had proved useful to her. Dr. Wong admitted that even today there are limited resources and medicine available to treat liverdisease. Dr. Wong reached the conclusion that the Plaintiff's condition had improved after 1982 as she had fewer consultations withhim thereafter but mainly came to him to prescribe more medicine up until 1987.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In cross-examination Dr. Wong was taken at length by Defence Counsel through his consultation notes (at Pages 131 to 192 of the Bundle)covering the period from 3rd January 1979 to 21st July 1987 to identify fees incurred by the Plaintiff for minor ailments unconnectedwith treatment of her liver condition. A total sum of $784.00 was identified in this way and Dr. Wong agreed that this sum shouldbe deducted from the fees calculation table (Exhibit P.3) to leave a balance of $57,086.00 ($57,870.00 - $784.00 = $57,086.00). Dr.Wong denied that the small dosage of calcium be prescribed for the Plaintiff to be taken orally and on 4 or 5 occasions by injectionwould have caused calcification of her body organs including the liver. He rejected Dr. Goh's evidence in this regard. When questionedabout the squiggle representing wire on the chest x-ray taken in September 1975 (Ex. P.7), Dr. Wong said that he was only able tosee this vague line on the x-ray film after it had been pointed out to him because he said no one looking at an x-ray looks everywhereto find the minutest detail. Dr. Wong said he was only looking at this x-ray film on his x-ray screen in his clinic as a physicianrather than as a radiologist, who is the expert in studying x-rays. Dr. Wong also admitted that he did not see the metallic shadowbelow the diaphragm in the x-ray film taken in November 1975 (Ex. P.8). Dr. Wong said that when he inspected the Plaintiff's spinalx-rays taken on 17th June 1982 (Ex. P.9) he wanted to find out about the bunch of wire plainly visible at the top of these 2 x-rayfilms. To this end he said he arranged for the C.T. scan to be done 3 months later to check out the representation on these x-rays.Dr. Wong denied that another x-ray would have given him any more information about the wire being inside or outside the Plaintiff'sbody and would not have solved the question as to why the liver was calcified. He considered that the C.T. scan would answer boththese questions and he stated that he was more interested in his patient that the wire shown on the x-ray. Dr. Wong said that thedelay in getting the C.T. scan done arose from Plaintiff's case not being urgent, the need to convince her to spend $3,000.00 asthe cost of this scan, and that the Raptist Hospital was installing a new C.T. scanning machine in 1982. Dr. Wong admitted that oneof the reasons be required the C.T. scan was to check on the bunch of wire in the 1982 spinal x-rays but he said it was not the mainreason, which was the calcification of the Plaintiff's liver. Dr. Wong admitted that he was very surprised to see the wire on thespinal x-rays in 1982 and that his first impression was to ask the Plaintiff if she had had something put inside her body but shesaid she did not. When asked why he did not arrange for an x-ray of the Plaintiff's abdomen which would have been much quicker andcheaper to confirm that wire was inside her body, Dr. Wong replied that his concern on seeing the definite pathology of the liverwas to find out the cause of this problem. He admitted he also had a duty to his patient to rind out about the bundle of wire seenon the x-rays and whether it was insider her body or not. Dr. Wong considered that an x-ray of the Plaintiff's abdomen would havebeen unnecessary work as it would have given the same information as the spinal x-rays without answering both questions as he hopedthe C.T. scan would. When questioned about why it never occurred to him that the calcification was around an abscess produced bythe surgical pad left inside the body, he replied that he wouldn't dare to make such an assumption or commitment and that he didn'tthink of that at the time. Dr. Wong added that he didn't think any doctor or surgeon would have made such a commitment that the coilof wire had caused such a big calcification. When it was put to Dr. Wong that the only thing that the wire seen on the 1982 x-rayscould have been was a surgical swab or pad with metallic thread, he denied that the wire had any particular feature to identify it as a surgical swab or pad and that the Plaintiffwould require a barium meal x-ray examination to show up the wire well enough to identify it as a surgical swab or pad. This witnessreferred to the barium meal x-ray taken in 1987 (Ex. P.15), which shows a considerably larger area of wire than the 1982 spinal x-rays(Ex. P.9) which show a close coil of wire, to point put that he could not have recognised the wire in the 1982 x-rays as metallicthread in a surgical pad. Dr. Wong explained that all doctors are busy in their work whatever their speciality and that they onlylook for pathological things in x-rays, that is, diseases occurring naturally in humans which they want to discover. Dr. Wong claimedthat he wrote a note to the radiologist doing the C.T. Scan in 1983 to look out for a foreign body as well as for polycystic diseaseof the liver. When questioned as to why he had not gone back to the radiologist doing the C.T. Scan to check why there was no mentionof the wire in his report (Ex. P.12), Dr. Wong said he had no experience with this modern medical technology and respected the findingsof the radiologist which he did not query. When asked about the C.T. Scan report (Ex. P.12) only referring to confirmation of hisdiagnosis of polycystic disease of the liver without reference to any investigation of any foreign body being present Dr. Wong wasevasive and defensive. When questioned about whether the reference to "curvilinear calific shadowing is also seen within this mass"in the C.T. Scan report taken in 1987 (Page 6 in the Bundle), Dr. Wong admitted that this expression meant a curved calicified lineor shadow but he could not say whether or not this was a reference to a foreign body without seeing the C.T. scan itself. Dr. Wongwas prepared to admit that the curvilinear line referred to in the 1987 C.T. scan report may have been caused by the wire in thesurgical pad but that the radiologist had not specified this in his report. Dr. Wong didnot offer any other explanation for the presenceof this curvilinear line, but after referring to the barium meal x-rays (Ex. P.15) he said that those x-rays showed a thin line orthread as compared to the 1987 C.T. scan which showed a thick curvilinear line. When questioned about the movement of the wire withinthe swab varying with its movement, the angle of the film, and the movement or position of the patient Dr. Wong agreed and commentedthat they seemed to be arguing over why be didn't see a "phantom".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> When asked why he had not referred the Plaintiff to be examined by a surgeon, Dr. Wong replied that he had examined hundreds, ifnot, thousands of patients with liver diseases and considered himself qualified to know if a liver patient could be save by surgery.When Dr. Wong was asked if his failure to see the wire from the surgical pad in the 1975 x-rays was a mistake on his part, he wouldnot accept that proposition as it was his opinion that no doctor, who saw those x-rays, could say that the metallic wire was a surgicalpad or swab. Furthermore, he said that there is no such thing as a definite shadow which typifies a surgical pad or swab that youcan define and that is why he described the shape and size of any pad or swab as a "phantom". When questioned whether he had everconsidered that a foreign body left after the 1967 operation could have caused a subphrenic abscess in the Plaintiff, Dr. Wong repliedthat this had proved to be the situation in this case but that one can ever be certain in medical practice where doctors only considertreating patients for diseases, rather than always being on guard for the mistakes of others which may never happen in one's lifetime.Dr. Wong refused to admit that his failure to see the metallic wire in the 1975 x-rays was a mistake which if it had not occurredcould have led to a diagnosis of the mass in the area of the liver as a subphrenic abscess resulting in the patient being referredto a surgeon for its removal in 1975. He pointed out that several other persons who had inspected the 1975 x-rays including the radiologisthad failed to see the metallic wire there. Dr. Wong stated that his only mistake was that he didn't insist on or enforce the Plaintiffto accept his advice to have an operation in 1983. Dr. Wong gave evidence that when he received the C.T. Scan report in 1983 he toldthe Plaintiff's daughter (P.W.5) of her mother's condition, namely, the 2 large cysts on her liver, and that as the Plaintiff hadhad infection before it would be in her best interests if she should have the 2 cysts remoyed from her liver to prevent any furtherrisk of infection. Dr. Wong said that his advice was not accepted, maybe because the Plaintiff was doing so well at that time. Dr.Wong admitted that there was no reference to this advice in his consultation notes. Finally, Dr. Wong agreed that it was a doctor'sduty to himself inspect any x-ray film or scans on his patient, in case the radiologist may have missed something and to check thatthe area complained of was covered by the film or scan. Dr. Wong qualified his answer by saying that he did not consider himselfto be superior to the radiologist, who was the expert in his specialist field, or to correct him if he had not done his job properly.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In re-examination Dr. Wong stated that the decision not to have the operation recommended by him in 1983 was very reasonable onebecause of the Plaintiff's age, the fact that his diagnosis of polycystic disease of the liver was a benign condition, the risk offurther infection was rather remote, and there was the question of her financial circumstances to beet the cost of an operation.Dr. Wong said that in the 1987 operation on the Plaintiff the 2 large cysts on the liver were drained but not removed and this wasthe same treatment he had recommended in 1983.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The Defendant called 2 medical practitioners to give evidence. The first witness was Dr. S.T. Fan who is a lecturer in surgery atthe University of Hong Kong and whose special interest is hepato-biliary surgery. This witness confirmed his report written on 16thNovember 1988 (Page 209 of the Bundle) in which he stated that a plain x-ray of the abdomen should reveal gauze labelled by a radioopaque thread. After close examination of the 1975 x-rays (Exs. P.7 and P.8) in Court Dr. Fan was eventually able to locate a radioopaque thread which he described as very suspicious in the sense that there may be something foreign in the abdomen or on the patient'sskin. He said that the next step would be to take an x-ray of the abdomen and to ensure that the patient had nothing on his skinwhen that x-ray was taken. Dr. Fan said that if the x-ray of the abdomen showed the same line he would suspect that there was a foreignbody inside the patient. Moreover, he said that if the patient had had an earlier operation he would suspect the foreign body tobe retained gauze and arrange for an operation to remove the foreign body. Dr. Fan said in cross-examination that a radio opaqueline can usually be seen clearly on a chest x-ray and that an x-ray of the abdomen would not be necessary to detect same. Dr. Fansaid that, although the 1975 x-rays were fading in their quality, if they were examined on an x-ray screen box, the radio opaqueline should be readily identified. He said such a line is suspicious and one can safely assume that it is qauze even if the patient'searlier operation was many years ago. Dr. Fan explained that where his report read that the "presence of calcification could maskthe thread" he meant that this could be so if the calcification had the same degree of radio density as the thread.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The second and last witness called by the Defendant was Dr. C.Y. Watt who has the following medical qualifications MBDS (H.K.), FRCS(Ireland), FRCS (Edinburgh), FACS, and a member of the World Association of hepato-pancreto-biliary surgery and whose present positionwas senior consultant surgeon at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Dr. Watt said he examined the Plaintiff on 30th November 1988 and wrotethe report at Pages 206-208 of the Bundle. He corrected a typing error in Paragraph 8(c) of his report by substituting the word "raytec"for "latex". Upon examination of the Plaintiff's 1975 x-rays Dr. Watt said that there were 2 curvilinear radio opaque lines to beseen below the diapbragm which were probably foreign bodies. With knowledge of the Plaintiff's history of a prior operation Dr. Wattstated that this foreign body was obviously a retained swab. He said that a plain x-ray of the abdomen would be advised to confirmthe presence of the foreign body. Dr. Watt first examined the 1975 x-rays (Exs. P.7 and P.8) in September 1989. When asked aboutDr. Louis Wong not having seen the radio opaque line in the 1975 x-rays Dr. Watt said that it may depend on the strength of the lightingin the x-ray screen box, although normally the such lighting should be strong enough to detect such lines. Dr. Watt was referredto the Plaintiff's spinal x-rays (Ex. P.9) taken in June 1982 which he had also seen previously. He said that in both x-ray filmscurvilinear opaque lines are to be seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and that in one of the x-rays there is also asoft tissue mass with a calcified wall detectable. When asked to comment on Dr. Louis Wong's evidence that he saw the wire on thesex-rays but did not know if it was inside or outside the body and had sent the patient for a C.T. scan some 8 months later, Dr. Wattsaid that if an x-ray film shows abnormal shadowing it can either be genuine or caused by an artefact during the developing of thefilm. Dr. Watt went on to say that in case of doubt another x-ray should be requested and the patient particularly advised to takeoff his or her clothes and any ornaments in the area of the x-ray film and to wear only a plain cotton gown without commercial labels.He said that if the second x-ray findings were the same the presence of a foreign body inside the body would be genuine. Dr. Wattdid not consider that Dr. Louis Wong's action in sending the patient for a C.T. scan some 8 months later was a reasonable approachto these abnormal findings. Dr. Watt stated that any professional seeing such abnormal findings should act immediately and treatthe patient accordingly by requesting a proper x-ray of the abdomen to confirm the presence of calcification and the foreign body.Dr. Watt said that having done that the x-ray would show that the calcification and wire there could only be shadows of foreign bodiesand the body reaction to their presence. In such circumstances Dr. Watt said that surgery was definitely indicated without furtherinvestigation. He went on to say that if a professional medical man saw such abnormal shadows and did not know what they were, whichis unlikely, he should ask colleagues for their opinion. In Dr. Watt's opinion failure to do so was not acceptable. He said thatif an operation is not done the foreign body would cause infection or inflammation in the body that would give a lot of sufferingto the patient and if the infection progressed it could be fatal. Dr. Watt had pointed out that the curvilinear radio opaque lineswere very obvious in the 1982 x-rays of the Plaintiff's spine and much more obvious that the lines shown on the 1975 x-ray films.When asked to comment on the effect of removing the abscess around the foreign body on the extent of the calcification around itDr. Watt stated that an abscess surrounded by a calcified rim is a very chronic abscess, that is, an abscess over a long period oftime, and that the effect of delayed removal of a foreign body would act on its chronicity and make subsequent management more difficult. Dr. Watt stated that the longer the foreignbody remained in the patient's body the worse would be the patient's condition. It was Dr. Watt's opinion that the calcium prescribedby Dr. Louis Wong for this patient for at least 2 years from 1979 would definitely have effected the calcification of the abscess.Dr. Watt said that even in individuals with normal blood levels of calcium it can be deposited in the walls of big blood vesselsand in areas of chronic inflammation. He added that calcium taken orally or by injection over for a long time would definitely increasethe chances of calcium being deposited in the big blood vessels, such as, the aorta, and in soft tissue, such as, in the wall ofan abscess in this patient. When asked to examine the C.T. scan film taken in 1983 (Fx. P.13) Dr. Watt reported that he could seeradio opaque lines and a dense mass present and that such findings are suspicious of a swab: Dr. Watt said that the diagnosis byDr. Louis Wong that the Plaintiff had polycystic disease of the liver was not supported by the radiologist in his 1983 C.T. scanreport (Ex. P.12) and that as should not have that diagnosis after seeing the spinal x-rays taken in 1982 because the shadows seenthere are abnormal did not consistent with his diagnosis. Dr. Watt said he did not know Dr. Louis Wong and could not comment on hisexperience or ability in treating liver patients.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Dr. Watt was questioned about the professional duties of a treating doctor who orders x-rays of a patient as regard to reading andinterpretation of those x-rays and said that the doctor would look at the x-ray film himself as well as consider the radiologist'sreport to co-relate the findings and the clinical assessment to form his own judgment. When asked if the treating doctor was entitledto rely entirely on the radiologist's report Dr. Watt said that this would depend on the experience and competence of the radiologistbut that to do so is a dangerous practice especially if the doctor is going to operate on the patient. In his opinion the doctorwho requests x-rays should read and interpret them himself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Dr. Watt said that after consideration of the 1983 C.T. scan and report on the Plaintiff (Exs. P.12 and P.13) he would have seenthat the cystic lesions on the liver were abscesses with calcified walls and not simple cysts and he would have sent the patientfor an operation as the best form of treatment for this condition. In this way the cystic lesions could be treated by open drainageof same and the foreign body could be removed at the same time. Dr. Watt disagreed with the evidence of Dr. Louis Wong that the 1987C.T. scan report made no reference to the surgical pad or the wires or shadows indicating same. Dr. Watt said that the last sentencein the first paragraph of that report where it states "curvilinear calcific shadowing is also seen within this mass" refers to theraytec wire which suggests the presence of the surgical pad. He went on to comment that he would expect a physician reading thisC.T. scan report to know that the above statement in the report referred to the wire when read together with the C.T. scan films.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> When Dr. Watt was asked if Dr. Louis Wong in his treatment of the Plaintiff should have considered a diagnosis of chronic subphrenicabscess surrounding a surgical pad, he replied that Dr. Wong should have had a suspicion of this condition after inspecting the chestx-rays taken in 1975. He went on to say that if Dr. Wong had not seen the curvilinear lines on the 1975 x-rays he would have missedthis diagnosis at an early stage of his treatment. However, Dr. Watt said that the lines and wire in the 1982 spinal x-rays are soobvious that these must have been seen by Dr. Wong. In Dr. Watt's opinion a doctor investigating a liver condition should obtainan x-ray of the abdomen after a blood test for liver function, but before other investigations, such as, ultrasound examination,liver scan or a C.T. scan so that if the Plaintiff had received a thorough and complete investigation for her liver condition in1975 the wire should have been detected at that time. Dr. Watt concluded his examination-in-chiof by saying that the only realisticdiagnosis by any doctor, who had seen the Plaintiff's spinal x-rays in 1982, was the presence of a chronic subphrenic abscess surroundinga surgical pad within the Plaintiff's body and that there could have been no other diagnosis at that stage.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In cross-examination Dr. Watt stated that raytec was the name given to the radio-opaque wire on surgical gauze swabs or pads, whereaslatex is a soft form of rubber usually used in making urinary catethers or examination gloves. He said that the reference to latexwire in Dr. Frank Cheng's report should be raytec wire. Dr. Watt admitted that in September 1989 when he examined the earlier x-raystaken of the Plaintiff in 1975 and 1982 there was no doubt in his mind that he would see radio-opaque lines of raytec wire in thosefilms because he knew that a surgical pad had been removed from the Plaintiff in 1987. Dr. Watt agreed that the radio-opaque linein the 1975 chest x-rays was short and small whereas the radio-opaque lines in the 1982 spinal x-rays were so obvious that they couldnot be anything else but raytec wire. He explained that when doctors see this radio-opaque line or shadow they can be almost 100%sure that it is raytec wire because the radiologists working in Government Hospitals in Hong Kong will double check the x-ray filmafter being taken and before sending the patient away. For this reason Dr. Watt said that extrinsic causes for the radio-opaque linescan be eliminated. Dr. Watt conceded that he did not have the benefit of hearing the evidence of Dr. Louis Wong given in Court over3 days at this assessment. When asked if a C.T. scan was an acceptable method of finding out 2 questions, firstly, whether the liveris calcified and, secondly, whether a foreign body is present, Dr. Watt agreed but said that Dr. Louis Wong had the C.T. scan donein 1983 to check for polycystic disease of the liver and not to check for the presence of a foreign body. Dr. Watt said it was notunusual to find the formation of a very chronic abscess in a case where a surgical pad was left behind as happened in this case.He said there was no way of telling from statistics which is more common in these cases, that is, a chronic abscess with a thickcalcified wall around it preventing infection spreading to other parts of the body, or an acute abscess which would spread infectionbecause it was not contained. Dr. Watt agreed that one of the symptoms of polycystic disease of the liver was an enlarged liver buthe did not consider the Plaintiff was suffering from this disease because, firstly, there would be more than 2 cysts with cysts allover the liver, and secondly, if there were only 2 cysts present they should appear on the left lobe and it is more likely to havekidney involvement as well. Heexplained that in this case, 1 cyst was on the right lobe and the other in the middle segment on theleft lobe, whereas, the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver and the kidney were free of cysts.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In re-examination Dr. Watt said that he would expect any doctor to see the raytec wire outline in the 1975 chest x-rays because theimage is fairly obvious and they are taught in medical school to look out for such outlines. He added that if a doctor saw an abnormalshadow on an x-ray and did not know what it was then he should consult with colleagues and/or medical reference books to find outan explanation for its presence on the film. It was put to Dr. Watt that the C.T. scan taken in 1983 was to ascertain whether theliver was calcified and also whether a foreign body was present as Dr. Louis Wong had given evidence that he requested the scan ona pink slip upon which he had written polycystic disease of the liver and foreign body or the initials for same "F.B.", however,in reply Dr. Watt said that if the instruction to the radiologist taking the C.T. scan was meant to be a returning diagnosis thenfrom his experience with radiologists their report would repeat all the diagnoses mentioned. In the 1983 C.T. scan report (Ex. P.12)under the heading "Clinical Bistory and Physical Examination Findings Summary" the only reference is to polycystic disease of theliver without any specific reference anywhere in the report to the pressure or otherwise of a foreign body and in such circumstancesDr. Watt had doubt whether this possible diagnosis had been put down on the request form. Dr. Watt in reply to a question from theMaster said he could see no reason why a normal x-ray of the Plaintiff's abdomen was never taken while she was under medical treatmentsince 1975 and that there would be no complications or dangers, such as, the patient being preqnant because of her age during thatperiod. Dr. Watt went on to say that, if preparation is good, a plain x-ray of the abdomen can provide much information of the abdominalorgans and tissues and, above all, it is the essential investigation for the presence of foreign bodies after surgery and for conditionsof intestinal obstructions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Leave was granted to Counsel for the Plaintiff to dile an Amended Statement of Claim to cover various items of special damages atthe close of the Defendant's evidence after no objection was taken by Counsel for the Defendant.

It is the Defendant's case that they should only be liable for foreseeable acts and the damages flowingtherefrom. The Defendant relies on the Latin maxim, novus actus interveniens, translated as a new intervening force or action incontending that the actions of two of the doctors who treated the Plaintiff are not within a class of foresseeable acts because theyfailed to exercise that standard of care reasonably to be expected of treating doctors.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Starting with the approach of Greer L.J. in <u>Havnes v.

On this basis the Defendantaccepts that general damages for the pain and suffering of the Plaintiff from 1967 until 1975 when she consulted Dr. Louis Wong andalso for the pain and suffering caused by the operation to remove the surgical pad in 1987 are payable by the Defendant subject tothe provisos that this pain and suffering was aggravated by the delay in diagnosis of the Plaintiff's problem by the acts and omissionof other doctors and that had the operation been performed earlier, such as, in 1975 the cost would have been considerably cheaper.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> On this basis that the Defendant is only liable for foreseeable acts and the damages flowing therefrom it is the Defence contentionthat the acts or omissions of Drs.

Plaintiff's Counsel makes the point thatall the doctors who looked at these films subsequently knew of the presence of the surgical pad so that little weight should be attachedto their evidence. Dr. Jack Wong who took a similar chest x-ray of the Plaintiff in 1987 (Ex. P.14) failed to spot the wire in thatx-ray even though he knew that the Plaintiff had had an earlier operation. It was his evidence after inspecting both the 1975 chestx-rays and the 1987 chest x-rays that the wire is faint in all those films. Plaintiff's Counsel urges the Court to place more weighton this evidence from Dr. Jack Wong as he did know of the presence of a surgical pad when he first inspected the 1987 chest x-rayfilm. Dr. Victor Goh in his evidence or his records did not mention seeing the wire in 1987 chest x-rays he received from Dr. JackWong, although he reported other findings and it may be inferred he did not notice the presence of the wire at that stage.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(c)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                Dr. Fan gave evidence that calcification around the surgical pad could mask the wire thread if the calcificationhad the same degree of radio density as the thread.

The patient had the earlier operation in 1967 some 8 years prior to when Dr. Louis Wong inspected the chest x-raysin September and November 1975.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(2)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                <u>Failure to act appropriately when he noticed a bunch of wires in the 1982 spinal x-rays</u>                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(a)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                Dr. Louis Wong gave evidence that when he noticed the wire at the top right corner of the x-ray he was suspiciousthat there might be a foreign body inside the Plaintiff so that he arranged for a C.T. scan of the liver. Dr. Wong explained thathis reason for not arranging for an x-ray of the Plaintiff's abdomen, was that the x-ray would only tell him whether there was aforeign body present, whereas, a C.T. scan would answer 2 questions, firstly, whether a foreign body was present, and secondly, whetherand why the liver was calcified. Plaintiff's Counsel alleges that it is irrelevant that no x-ray of the abdomen was obtained, asa C.T. scan was done, and Dr. Watt in his evidence agreed that this test was acceptable to answer the above 2 questions raised. Thereason for the 8 month delay in taking of the C.T. Scan in February 1983 was explained by Dr. Louis Wong in his evidence.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(b)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                There were other possibilities than the presence of wire from a surgical pad inside the patient's body. In 1982 thePlaintiff's first operation was 15 years previously and no infection had spread from the abscess containing the surgical pad dueto calcification. The natural tendency for doctors is to look for pathological findings in x-rays, that is, diseases occurring naturally,rather than foreign bodies left behind due to the mistakes of others.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(c)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                The C.T. scan report in 1983 made no mention of a foreign body and it was reasonable for Dr. Louis Wong to replyon the findings of the radiologist. In the 1987 C.T. Scan Report there is no express mention of any foreign body either and the onlyreference in that report to suggest the presence of wire was "curvilinear calcific shadowing is also seen within the mass". Dr. Watt'sevidence that he would expect a radiologist to refer in his C.T. scan report to each and every possible diagnosis mentioned by thedoctor in his request, is not borne out by the 1987 C.T. scan report, which followed a barium meal x-ray that revealed a calcificmass appearing to contain metallic surgical wires. The radiologist in his 1987 C.T. scan report did not expressly mention eithersurgical wire thread or the presence of a foreign body. For this reason Dr. Watt's evidence expressing doubt whether Dr. Louis Wonghad requested a diagnosis of finding a foreign body in the 1983 C.T. scan should be disregarded.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="128" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(d)    </td>            <td width="628" valign="middle">                Dr. Wong's attention was focussed on finding out the cause of the enlarged, hard and tender liver for which he hadbeen treating the Plaintiff for some time.

Ho Hing Mui</u> Civil Appeal No. 60 in 1982 to the actions of Dr. Stephen Soo in this case it would be unreasonable to find that his conduct wasnegligent. While it was a deliberate choice by Dr. Soo to do the positive act of administering injections of medicine to the Plaintiffat ber request, this decision can only be criticised for his failure either to communicate with Dr. Louis Wong, who was treatingher for a liver condition, or to have given the Plaintiff a full clinical examination himself. This was a mistake or error of judgmenton the part of Dr. Soo, but not such as to constitute negligent conduct. Applying common sense to the facts and circumstances ofthis case Dr. Soo was a busy general practitioner operating a medical clinic in the Wah Fu Estate and was requested by the Plaintiffto administer to her by injection medicine prescribed by her treating doctor as a matter of convenience. The failure to refer toDr. Louis Wong before agreeing to give these injection was less than the standard of care to be expected of a treating doctor butnot such as to render the consequences unforeseeable. The omission of Dr. Soo was an error of judgment or a reasonable mistake onhis part which must be recognised as a risk incidental to medical treatment and inherent in the human fallibility of all medicalpractitioners. For the above reasons and those set out by Counsel for the Plaintiff in the previous paragraph, in particular, thathe was merely the conduit for Dr. Louis Wong's treatment, the chain of causation has not been broken by Dr. Soo's actions and/oromissions to establish novus actus interveniens.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Turning to the actions and/or omissions of Dr. Louis Wong, who treated the Plaintiff between 1975 and 1987, it will be more convenientto consider separately the treatment given in 1975 and later and that given in 1982 and later. In consideration of the 1975 treatmentDr. Louis Wong is placed at a serious disadvantage in that his consultation notes relating to the Plaintiff from 1975 to the endof 1978 have been mislaid in changing premises and be was forced to rely on his memory for treatment given up to 15 years ago. Themain objection to Dr. Louis Wong's treatment in 1975 was his failure to see the shadow or line of raytec wire in the chest x-rayfilms taken in September and November. The arguments for and against this omission have been set out at length earlier in this assessmentand will not be repeated again. In deciding whether this omission by Dr. Louis Wong was a mere innocent mistake or negligent conductthe following factors were considered crucial:</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(1)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">                The line on the 1975 x-ray films is a single curved one and guite short in length.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(2)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">                The single line is faint and difficult to discern at the foot of the x-ray films even against a strong light andwhen it has been pointed out.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(3)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">                Other witnesses had problems in locating the line on these chest x-ray films.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(4)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">                Dr. Jack Wong, who had a similar chest x-ray of the Plaintiff done in 1987, did not notice the line or shadow ofthe raytec wire in that later x-ray.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(5)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">                Neither the radiologist used by Dr. Louis Wong in 1975, nor that used by Dr. Jack Wong in 1987 reported the findingof a shadow or line which could be raytec wire.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="126" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(6)    </td>            <td width="633" valign="middle">There was evidence from Dr. Fan that calcification surrounding thesurgical pad could have masked the extent of the wire thread.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In applying the same test to these omissions by Dr. Louis Wong to see the shadow or line in the 1975 chest x-ray films the real issuethat arises is whether such mistakes or omissions are sufficient to break the chain of causation. In other words, was Dr. Louis Wong'sfailure to notice the raytec wire on the x-ray films in 1975 one of the things likely to arise as a consequence of having the surgicalpad in the Plaintiff that a reasonable man would have foreseen it. After taking into account all the facts and circumstances of thiscase, in particular, those factors outlined above, and applying common sense to same it is not considered that Dr. Wong's omissionsor failures to act in 1975 constituted negligent conduct. While this mistake or miscalculation by Dr. Wong may be considered unreasonablerather than a mere innocent mistake, it cannot be said to be so improbable or unforeseeable that the Defendant as the original wrongdoercan escape responsibility on the basis of unforeseeability. Furthermore, Dr. Wong's conduct in this regard cannot be considered sufficientlyunreasonable that it gives rise to an intervening act or novus actus interveniens.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In consideration of the second period of Dr. Wong's treatment during 1982 and subsequent thereto the doctor's consultation notesare available and these events are comparatively more recent. The objections raised to Dr. Wong's treatment at this stage was thatafter seeing the clear lines of raytec wire on the spinal x-ray films in June 1982 he failed to investigate the matter properly apartfrom referring the Plaintiff for a C.T. scan some 8 months later. Further objections were that Dr. Wong (1) never obtained an abdominalx-ray at any stage; (2) referred the patient or x-rays to another doctor for a second opinion; (3) persisted in paintaining a diagnosisof polycystic disease of the liver; (4) never considered a diagnosis of subprenic abscess containing a surgical swab. The factorsrelied on by both parties in regard to these objections have been fully canvassed earlier and will not be repeated. In considerationof whether or not Dr. Wong's actions and/or omissions were both unforeseeable and sufficiently unreasonable to break the chain ofcausation by giving rise to an intervening act, that is, a novus actus interveniens, the following evidence was found to be morepersuasive on this crucial issue:</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="117" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(1)    </td>            <td width="642" valign="middle">                The lines or shadows of raytec wire in the 1982 spinal x-ray films are patently obvious to anyone inspecting same.Dr. Wong in his evidence described the lines on the x-ray films as "something that looked like a bundle of wire in the patient";                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="117" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(2)    </td>            <td width="642" valign="middle">                Dr. Wong took no immediate action to determine the cause of lines or shadows on the 1982 spinal x-ray films clearlyindicating the presence of raytec wire thread inside the Plaintiff's body. A normal x-ray of the Plaintiff's abdomen or a bariummeal x-ray examination would have eliminated any possible extrinsic explanation and confirmed the presence or otherwise of the wirethread from a surgical pad inside the Plaintiff's body. Either or both of these examinations would have been very much cheaper thanthe C.T. scan taken 8 months later, which was a considerable period of delay when imminent surgery would most likely be requiredto remove the surgical pad.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="117" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(3)    </td>            <td width="642" valign="middle">                Dr. Wong persisted in his clinical diagnosis of polycystic disease of the liver for the Plaintiff's condition, whichhe admitted was a rare congenital disease of the liver, in the face of clear evidence of raytec wire thread indicating the presenceof a surgical pad in the spinal x-rays, and to a lesser extent the reference in C.T. scan report to "curvilinear calific shadowing"being seen within the mass.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="117" valign="top" style="text-align:right">(4)    </td>            <td width="642" valign="middle">Dr. Wong continued to treat the Plaintiff in much the same way after June 1982 as he had done perviously in prescribing the same drugsfor injection without having taken adeguate steps to explain the "bundle of wire" he had seen on the spinal x-ray films.

Johns</u> supra the real question to be asked is whether the whole sequence of these events is a natural and probable consequence of the Defendant'snegligence and a reasonably foreseeable result of it. In the actions of Dr. Wong since June 1982 in treating the Plaintiff therewere both deliberate choices to do positive acts, such as, to arrange for a C.T. scan some 8 months later and to persevere with thesame treatment; and also there were omissions and failures to act, such as, the failure to make an early investigation into the causeof the wire thread shown on the spinal x-rays or to seek a second opinion, if in doubt over his diagnosis. These acts and omissionswere not innocent mistakes or reasonable miscalculations but must be considered to be conduct which was begligent taking into accountthat Dr. Wong was not acting under the pressures and the gravity of an emergency or the need to act quickly, which was the case ofthe surgeon in <u>Attorney General v. Ho Hing Mui</u> supra. As cited with approval in that case "the answer to this difficult question must be dictated by common sense rather than logicon the facts and circumstances of each case". Adopting this advice and applying the test referred to above, the decision reachedin this case is that the negligent conduct of Dr. Louis Wong since he inspected the spinal x-ray films in June 1982 has broken thechain of causation. His failure to exercise that standard of care reasonably to be expected of a doctor treating a patient has resultedin improbable or unforeseeable consequences, namely, the Plaintiff continuing to suffer from the presence of a subprenic abscessaround a surgical pad inside her body for a further 5 years; the operation to remove same being postponed for that period duringwhich the Plaintiff remained at risk from infection with the possibility of a pore serious outcome; and the residual pain and biscomfortsuffered by the Plaintiff since the operation in 1987 being increased from the longer period of calcification around the foreignbody from 1982 to 1987. It follows that the Defendant can rely on novus actus interveniens for the unforeseeable and unreasonableactions and omissions of Dr. Wong for the period from June 1982 to July 1987 when appropriate action was taken to treat the Plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Prior to opening the case for the Plaintiff Miss Kwan raised the issue of whether the Defendant could rely on noves actus interveniensunless it had been pleaded with particularity, which is not the case in the Defence filed by the Defendant. Miss Hartstein for theDefendant in reply contended that it was for the Plaintiff to prove each item of damages claimed and also whether those damages werelegally foreseeable by the Defendant at the time of its negligence; and that as such, the proof of damages was a matter of evidenceto be assessed by the Court rather than a matter of pleading. In its Defence the Defendant has only admitted the fact of a gall bladderoperation on the Plaintiff in January 1967 and that a surgical swab remained inside her abdomen after the wound was sutured withthe Plaintiff being put to strict proof of all other matters. In the earlier case of <u>Attorney-General v. Ho Hing Mui</u> supra the Crown had merely denied that such of the symptoms of ill-health or injury as the Plaintiff may prove to be suffering werecaused or contributed to by the piece of gauze left in the abdomen. In that case Leonard V.P. remarked that the Crown's claim thatit was not answerable because of an intervening party had not been pleaded with any great particularity. Such criticism is even morevalid in this case where no attempt has been made by the Crown to raise this defence in the pleadings. Regardless of this defectin the pleadings, it is ruled that the Plaintiff is required to prove each item of damages in a negligence action on a balance ofprobabilities and the Defendant can raise the issue that the head of general damage is too remote and not foreseeableat the timeof its negligence. As for the Plaintiff, it is most surprising that Dr. Louis Wong, at least, was not joined as a Defendant in thisaction. The Defendant, somewhat belatedly after judgment on liability had been entered and the date of this assessment had been fixed,was granted leave to join Dr. Louis Wong and Dr. Stephen Soo as Third Parties. As the liability of the Third Parties has yet to bedetermined and they were not represented at this assessment, despite being crucial witnesses, the Plaintiff may be unable to recoverdamages aginst Dr. Wong as a Third Party for the 5 year period of his novus actus interveniens. However, if the statutory 3 yeartime limit has expired to bring proceedings against Dr. Wong, the legally aided Plaintiff should seek independant advice as to whetheror not action should be taken against her solicitors.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The bottom line at this assessment must be the quantum of general damages to be awarded for the Plaintiff's pain, suffering and lossof amenities. As explained in Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort at page 624, pain and suffering includes the suffering attributable tothe injury itself and to any consequential medical treatment, and worry about the effects of the injury upon the Plaintiff's wayof life and prospects, including worry attributable to "compensation neurosis" which will cease on the determination of this claimfor damages.

Such damages are said to be "at large" and their gualification cannot necessarilybe done on a comparison basis where a suitable standard for comparison is not available. In general terms the damages awarded fornon-pecuniary loss should be fair and reasonable, taking into account all the relevant heads of damage, that though awards shouldbe conventional they should not be artificial, that there should be an adequate degree of consistency in awards and that awards shouldkeep pace with the times, in particular, inflationary trends in the value of money.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> It is appreciated that the above statements and remarks have been made in cases in the U.K. and that in Hong Kong the Court of Appealin <u>Lee Ting Lam v. Leung Kam Ming</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20HKLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) H.K.L.R. 657</a> and more recently in <u>Lau Che Ping V.

The 4 categories were labelled serious, substantial, gross disability and disasterwith increased awards according to the severity of the disablement. In the later case the Court of Appeal at P.653 observed thatthey would not exclude reliance upon English authorities in matters of principle and that useful guidance may perhaps be found withregard to rare or particular circumstances or by way of comparison of one injury with another. Later on the same page Cons ActingC.J. in that case had this to say:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The starting point is a comparison of the injuries in the case in question with injuries in similar cases in which awards have alreadybeen made by the court. Consideration must next be given to any special feature or features which might influence the award in theparticular case and only then, when a tentative conclusion will already have been reached, should attention be turned to the establishedguidelines. If the tentative conclusion does not conform to the guidelines then serious consideration should be given to whetherthere is indeed sufficient justification for an award that is otherwise apparently out of line with the general pattern. This Courtdid not by <u>Lee Ting Lam</u> intend to confine damages in a straight jacket. If the sartorial analogy is to be pursued, this Court hoped rather to provide themwith what in earlier days would have been referred to as a good foundation garment, a garment upon which all other dresses appropriatefor particular occasions would sit comfortably."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> And later at page 654 the Acting Chief Justice had said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Changes inevitably take place in the everyday life of any growing society and the expectations of the average person and family tendto increase as each year goes by. Hong Kong is no exception, and those changes must be reflected in the general standards of awards,otherwise the awards will cease to be regarded as fair and reasonable compensation."</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In the light of these comparatively recent comments of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal it is most surprising that both Counsel forthe parties have slavishly followed the serious injury category in quantifying the sum to be awarded under this head of damage. Onewould have expected that Counsel for the Plaintiff, at least, would have suggested a much higher award than $100,000.00 upwards onthe basis of a serious injury category of $135,000.00 to $180,000.00. Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff's damagesshould not be within the range of serious injury as she had no serious disability and the pain she suffered over the years was notincapacitating, but, for the most past minor and infrequent. The figure of $80,000.00 was proposed as being appropriate. Furthermore,Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the Defendant should only be liable for 30% of this figure of $80,000.00 being the painand suffering for the 8 year period prior to the Plaintiff's first consultation with Dr. Louis Wong in 1975 and for some of the woundpain since her operation in 1987.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Adopting the starting point proposed in <u>Lau Che Ping</u> supra clearly this is not a case where a comparison of the injuries in the case can be made with injuries in similar cases in whichawards had already been made by the Court. The only relevant authority cited at this assessment was an award of $85,000.00 by Mr.Justice Fuad in 1982 in the case <u>Ho Hing Mui v. Attorney-General</u> H.C.A. Wo. 4321 of 1981. However, the facts and circumstances of that case are very different from the present case. The specialfeature in this case is that the Plaintiff carried a surgical pad inside her body for almost 21 years despite having had medicaltreatment for symptoms associated with this cause for 12 years. The conclusion to be reached is a firm one, rather than being merelya tentative one, that this case does not conform to the guidelines and there is indeed more sufficient justification for an awardthat is otherwise apparently out of line with the general pattern.

Counsel forthe Defendant submits that these additional nursing expenses should not be payable by the Defendant as they have not been shown tobe necessary and also referred to the account form used by the H.K. Sanatarium and Hospital where provision has been made for privatenursing fees to be included, but this was not done in the hospital accounts sent to the Plaintiff. Defence Counsel rely on an unreporteddecision in 1972 of Assistant Registrar B.L. Jones, as he then was, in <u>Wong Yuk Ching v. Kenneth K.C. Kwan</u> F.C.A. No. 967 of 1971 where he said "It may be customary and convenient for a patient to employ a servant whilst in hospital andto pay gratuities but neither of these expenses can be recovered from the Defendant". In this case there was evidence from the Plaintiff'sdaughter that there fewer hospital nurses on duty at night time and they could not provide continuous care to the Plaintiff duringthe night. Furthermore she said that her mother had lots of tubes into her body after the operation and she could not move even topress the button for assistance from nursing staff. In these dircumstances the employment of a registered nurse for constant careof the Plaintiff during the night shift period after the operation for 5 nights from 28th August 1987 to 2nd September 1987 was justifiedand necessary. Accordingly, this   claim for $2,650.00 on basis of $530.00 per night will be allowed. The employment of 1 nursingattendant during the daytime when more hospital nursing staff were available to care for the Plaintiff and another attendant at nightafter the initial 5 day period must be a luxury and unnecessary and the cost of same will be disallowed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> On this question of special damages Counsel for the Defendant also made the point that the costs allowed for treatment by other doctorsin 1987 and the cost of the operation should be reduced to take account of the inflation factor since the date of the Dr. Wong'snovus actus interveniens in 1982. It is considered that there is substance and force in this argument as any sum allowed by way ofreduction should be recoverable against Dr. Kong if within the statutory time limit or possibly against the Plaintiff's solicitorsif outside that time limit. One must be mindful of the following advice of Acting Chief Justice Cons in <u>Lau Che Ping. v. Hoi Kong Ironwares Godown Co. Ltd.</u> supra:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Updating (of awards) is principally required because of the fall in the purchasing power of money. This can be, and regularly is,taken care of in each individual judgment by reference to the rate of inflation. There is no need for general interference by thisCourt excert that one would remark that it is dangerous to adopt a standard rate of 10% for each year. That may have been a convenientrule of thumb at one time, but it is no longer appropriate in view of the wide variations that have occurred in the last few years."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Doing the best one can to take account of the inflation factor in Hong Kong between 1982 and 1987 a reduction of 25% will be allowedto the Defendant for the medical expenses allowed to Dr. Jack Wong, Dr. Victor Gob, Dr. Frank Cheng, the H.K.
