In short I found the Defendant succeeded in itscounterclaim against the Plaintiff to the extent of $ 31,860.61 ($15,000 + 8,116.50 + 1,581 + 4,434.11 + 2,729). I dismissed thebalance of the counterclaim. I ruled that the Defendant was entitled to set off the sum of $31,860.61 against the Judgment sum of$325,338.97. I made a <em>nisi</em> Costs Order in respect of the balance of the Plaintiff's claim, the Notice Disputing Authenticity and on the Defendant's counterclaim.The Defendant applies to vary that part of the said Costs Order concerning the Defendant's counterclaim, which was under para. 50of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"50. As to the counterclaim, the Defendant succeeded in part only. On the basis that costs to follow the event, the Defendant shouldhave costs of the counterclaim relating to those Debit Notes it succeeded while the Plaintiff should have costs against the Defendanton those Debit Notes which the Defendant failed. Costs to be taxed if not agreed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">General Principle</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> It is not in dispute that as a general principle, a successful party to an action should not be ordered to pay any part of the costsof the hearing simply because he has failed to prove all the allegations made. The successful party should not pay any of the costsunless he acted improperly or unreasonably in raising issues. See <strong>Re Elginadate</strong> <strong>(No.2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%201207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 W.L.R. 1207</a> and <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</em> 2002 62/3/3). It is also not in dispute that costs are in the discretion of the court.</p>    <p class="heading">Proper Costs Order to be made</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Wong, counsel for the Defendant urged me to consider awarding costs to the Defendant for the counterclaim on the above generalprinciple, saying that the Defendant was the successful party. Alternatively it is submitted that the 9 debit notes were so closelyrelated that the Defendant should get the costs of the counterclaim even not fully successful in view of the way the case was heard.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Mr. Ng, in opposing the application has referred me to the case of <strong>A.E.I Ltd v Phonographic Performance Ltd</strong> (C.A.)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20WLR%201507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 W.L.R. 1507</a> in which Lord Wolfe M.R. has reiterated the position that the 'costs to follow the event' principle was a starting point from whicha court could readily depart. The learned judge referred to Order 62 of the 'new' Rules (i.e. <em>The Civil Procedure Rules</em> <em>1998</em>) in the United Kingdom and said the new Rules 'are reflecting a change of practice which has already started' in that they 'requirecourts to be more ready to make separate orders which reflect the outcome of different issues' (see page 1523 of the judgment).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In essence the Defendant relied on 9 debit notes to establish the counterclaim. Of course for the proper administration of justiceall 9 debit notes should be heard together and any suggestion to have 9 actions/hearings would have been absurd. Nevertheless itis still clear from the evidence before me that there were 9 separate and distinct claims represented by those 9 debit notes whichwere heard together. Different documents were adduced/referred to in support of those 9 claims. This is not a case where a partyis suing on, say, a breach of contract, and only succeeded in proving some of the allegations made; or a claim based on tort whereonly some of the heads of damages are proved. The fact that the Defendant did not succeed in all 9 claims means that it is not asuccessful party in respect of <em>all</em> of them and cannot be said to be a successful party regarding the counterclaim. Having considered Mr. Wong's alternative submissionI maintain that the Costs Order I have made on 17.10.2002 fairly reflected the position, i.e. costs to follow the event. I refusedthe Defendant's application to review the said Order is dismissed with costs.</p>    <p class="heading">Apportionment</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In order to assist the Taxing Master, should no agreement on costs be reached, I accede to the request of Mr. Wong which was supportedby Mr. Ng to make an apportionment in respect of the three-day trial. It is my estimate that 65% of the trial time was spent on thosedebit notes which were successful and 30% on those not successful with 5% on evidence relating to the issue of authenticity. I havealready made no order as to costs regarding the said Notice Disputing Authenticity (see para 49 of the judgment dated 17.10.2002).It is my ruling that there will be no order as to costs regarding the 5% trial time I have apportioned.</p>    <p class="heading">Certificate for counsel</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Wong asked me to certify his attendance as counsel being proper in the circumstances of the case as the amount recovered by theDefendant does not exceed $150,000 (see Schedule 1, Part II Rule 2 (3) under Order 62 of the Rules of the District Court, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>).Mr. Ng opposed the application on the basis that a solicitor could have represented the Defendant in these proceedings. In my viewthe Defendant's counterclaim in relation to the 9 debits notes, in itself, was not complicated. In my judgment dated 17.10.2002 Ihave already pointed out that the Defendant's legal representative had failed to exercise care to ensure only relevant documentsin chronological order were placed before me (see para 15 of the said Judgment). Such failure had made it difficult for me to followthe Defendant's counterclaim and I spent a lot of time getting things in order. I do not think the legal or factual issues involvedin this case were such that counsel should have been briefed. I therefore declined Mr. Wong's request.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judianna Barnes</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. NG Man Kin of M/s Kwok Ng &amp; Chan for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr. William M F Wong ins't by M/s Au Yeung Cheng Ho &amp;Tin for Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2002/223.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
