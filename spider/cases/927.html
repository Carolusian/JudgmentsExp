He was struck, he alleges, by a light goods vehicle bearing registration plates FS488, which drove into him from behind.The vehicle did not stop.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Police inquiries eventually traced the vehicle to a man named Mok Ying Kit on the 8th May 1995 at Fanling. He was told the vehiclewas believed to be carrying a false licence. Mok said he had borrowed the vehicle from a friend, "Ah Keung" the previous evening.He had no knowledge concerning the licence.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mok later in an interview went on to state that he had known "Ah Keung" since 1993, that he lived in Shenzhen, but that he had nomeans of contacting "Ah Keung", though the latter phoned him on occasions to see if work was available. He knew "Ah Keung" had owneda vehicle for about one year. They arranged to meet on the 7th May in a telephone conversation in which "Ah Keung" asked if therewas any job for him; Mok said there was. The meeting took place at 2030 hours that night when "Ah Keung" handed over the vehicleand then returned to the Mainland. He was to telephone Mok when he came back to Hong Kong. The story has all the elements of "a likelytale".</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Just over a fortnight later (on 23rd May), Mok was seen again by the Police. He was told vehicle GB6121 had been stolen between 25thand 26th August 1994. At this stage it must have become apparent to the Police that "FS488" was in fact GB6121. It had belonged toMr. Lau Wai Man who had reported it stolen at or about that time. Mok's reply was "I say nothing". A few minutes later it was putto him that he was in fact the driver on the 18th January 1995 when the Plaintiff was knocked down, and that he drove off withoutstopping. Again he said "I say nothing".</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In view of his earlier story as to how and when he came to be in possession of the vehicle the two "No comment" reactions to thesubsequent allegations are capable of bearing a clear inference. If he had nothing to hide the answers could so easily have beenan unequivocal "no". Nearly three months later he was interviewed again with the allegation that he was driving "FS488" when it knockeddown the Plaintiff. On this occasion he denied the allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Plaintiff commenced his action against Mok as the first Defendant and against Lau Wai Man as the second Defendant in the alternative.He has discontinued against the second Defendant, who was the original owner, on the agreed basis that the vehicle had been stolenand that he never recovered possession of the vehicle and was not driving it on the night of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The action therefore proceeds against the person in whose possession the vehicle was found some 31/2 months later. He is representedby Solicitors who happen also to be instructed by the original insurers of the vehicle when it was in Lau Wai Man's possession andcontrol. These insurers are no doubt funding the cost of the defence. The former insurers are contending that they are no longer"insurers concerned". I am not concerned with that issue, if it is one. Mr. Mohan Bharwaney in his argument before me has contendedthat the insurers' decision to bear the costs of the defence of the action (against Mok) offends public policy and is an exampleof maintenance and champerty. At present the insurance position and the responsibility, if any, of the M.I.B. is unclear. These proceedingsdo not involve any requirement to determine those issues.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The AIU (the insurers of Mr. Lau Wai Man, the original owner of the vehicle) deny that they are the 'insurers concerned' on the basisthat there was no insurable interest, the vehicle keys and documents having been transferred to AIU approximately one week beforethe accident occurred. However, the M.I.B.'s stance is that for a number of reasons, which I do not need to identify, AIU, remainsthe 'insurer concerned'.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Plaintiff's contentions are also in the alternative; she is entitled to judgment against the first Defendant, with a view toenforcing that judgment against AIU as insurer concerned, or she fails in her case against the first Defendant there being an unknownor untraced driver of the vehicle which struck her. The judgment after trial will make one finding or the other, subject to any matterof contributory negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In all these circumstances I see no offence to public policy in the insurance company (concerned or not) being prepared to meet theDefendant's costs in defending a claim where the basic issues have to be determined as a prerequisite to any resolution of the issuesbetween the AIU and the M.I.B. I have considered the authorities referred to by Mr. Bharwaney. The problem he faces is that AIU clearlyhas a legitimate interest in the proceedings. In fact I would go so far as to say that there is a public interest in such proceedingsbeing fully and properly contested. What proceedings the Plaintiff may or may not take after this action has been decided is notthe Court's concern yet, and I do not need to apply my mind to that aspect. Buckley L.J. in <strong>British Cash and Parcel Conveyors Ltd. v. Lamson Store Service Co. Ltd.</strong> 1908. K.B. at 1021 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is not maintenance to uphold a party in litigation in whose result the party accused of maintenance has a real and bona fide interest."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Given the circumstances of this case - the first Defendant is "prima facie" a handler of stolen property; and certainly has no legitimateinterest in the motor vehicle concerned, and could not himself benefit from any insurance cover, - it is inconceivable in my view,that AIU could be regarded as acting unlawfully. Danckwerts L.J. in <strong>Martell v. Consett Iron Co.</strong> 1955 1. Ch. at p. 386 in relation to maintenance said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A doctrine which was evolved to deal with cases of oppression should not be allowed to become an instrument of oppression .....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Support of legal proceedings based on a bona fide community of pecuniary interest or religion or principles or problems, is quitedifferent and .....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">the law would be wrong and oppressive if such support were to be treated as a crime or a civil wrong. But I do not believe that thelaw is in that condition."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He cited Lynskey J.'s comments on the Legal Aid Acts which can be seen in its full, and in my view significant, context in <strong>Baker v. Jones</strong> 1954 1. W.L.R. at p. 1011:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In these days, however, of insurance policies giving an indemnity against both damages and costs to wrong doers, trade unions whoserules provide for paying the legal costs of their members, and the Legal Aid Acts, maintenance is not now regarded with the samerepugnance as it was by the old common law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> We do not need reminding these days of the approved existence in some common law jurisdictions of actions funded on a contingencyfee basis, a far more questionable practice in the context of the old common law practices of maintenance and champerty. We do howeverneed to remind ourselves of the purpose of the AIU funding the defence: to require the Plaintiff to prove his case, to determinewhether the Defendant or some untraced driver was at the controls of the vehicle, and whether the Plaintiff was responsible to anyextent for the collision. These are not issues giving rise to the spectre of unlawful participation in an action, regardless of whetherthe tort of maintenance has been abolished in Hong Kong. The idea of injunctive relief against the firm or an individual thereinrestraining it or him from acting is unacceptable in the context of this case. There is therefore, no substance in the Plaintiff'sargument against AIU's involvement.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The second purpose of this application is to join the M.I.B. as a Defendant to the action with a view to obtaining a judgment againstthe M.I.B. either in addition to a judgment against the first Defendant or as an alternative to such.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The only M.I.B. agreement in existence in Hong Kong is that of the 1st February 1981 entitled the Domestic Agreement. There is regrettablyno M.I.B. agreement relating to the situation where the driver of the vehicle is unidentified/untraced. This is therefore unlikethe position in the United Kingdom.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Bharwaney seeks to fill this gap relying upon the English Court of Appeal decision in <strong>Gurtner v. Circuit</strong> 1968 2. Q.B. p. 587, made before an Untraced Driver's M.I.B. Agreement came into existence in the United Kingdom. A quick reviewof the facts in the headnote of the report of that case illustrates Mr. Bharwaney's difficulties and the weakness of his argument.The Defendant had been identified. Indeed the Police had interviewed him, seen his Insurance Certificate but omitted to note hisInsurance Company. He emigrated to Canada and could not be traced for service of the writ. The M.I.B. were contacted, tried to assistbut was unable to do so. The Plaintiff obtained leave for substituted service upon the insurance company which had on behalf of theM.I.B. carried out investigations to trace the Defendant. The M.I.B. then applied to be joined as a Defendant as it considered itmight be liable to satisfy any judgment obtained, by reason of its 1946 Agreement with the Minister of Transport. It also wantedto set aside certain interlocutory matters and to argue whether the Plaintiff in that action had complied with its obligations underthe agreement. The Court of Appeal reversed the Single Judge's decision and restored that of the Master. The judgment of DenningM.R. at p. 595 to 596 covers succinctly (as one had come to expect) the issues and the just and legal way of resolving them. Thiscase is not authority for Mr. Bharwaney's proposition. The situation with which it dealt is wholly removed from that in this case.The M.I.B. cannot be brought into the proceedings at the whim of the Plaintiff without any proper basis. The Court is not to be usedas a cudgel to take a partisan stance to force an outcome for which there is at present no legal basis. This is not a case in whichthe M.I.B. is likely to want to participate of its own volition. The basic issues, which may never concern it, will in any eventbe covered by the representation available to the Defendant. The proper course for this action to take is for the question of liabilityto be resolved as soon as possible. Depending on the outcome the AIU and/or the M.I.B. can consider its stance. The Plaintiff canalso consider his position. Just as the Minister of Transport was the only party entitled to enforce the contract with the M.I.B.in the United Kingdom so the authorised insurers who were parties to the M.I.B. agreement in Hong Kong and the Government of HongKong who made authorised insurers bound by the provisions of the agreement as a condition of their being authorised, are the onlyparties entitled to bring an action to enforce the contract. In the event we are some stages removed from that potential state ofaffairs. The Plaintiff has no cause of action against the M.I.B.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> <strong>Clarke v. Vedel</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1979%20RTR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1979 R.T.R. 26</a> a decision by a strong Court of Appeal in England, was made against the background of the existence of both M.I.B. agreements (inthe United Kingdom), but was concerned with the position in respect of the Untraced Drivers Agreement. Without going into the circumstancesof that case it is clear that it lends no support to Mr. Bharwaney's argument.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Accordingly the application for joinder is misconceived and must fail. The action must proceed, as presently constituted, to judgment.I have been asked by the Defendant to consider a split trial. Although I appreciate the arguments that the Defendant's solicitorswill incur substantial costs in preparing the quantum issue when they may not have to meet any judgment; - in short, where the Plaintifffails on liability, - I think there is another factor to consider and that is the cost of a second hearing on quantum. There is alsothis factor. The Defendants do not have to obtain their own battery of medical advisers. They can sensibly agree the reports of thePlaintiff's medical experts thereby keeping the time and cost of this aspect to a bare minimum.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I will reserve the question of costs. On the face of it the Defendants are entitled to their costs of this hearing but given thecomplexities of this case, it may be possible to make a fairer decision at a later stage when finality has been reached. I leaveopen until that date any argument as to costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Conrad Seagroatt)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Mohan Bharwaney instructed by the D.L.A. for the Plaintiff.</p>        <p>Miss Susan Kwan instructed by T.
