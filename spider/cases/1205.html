The judgment had followed a six-day trial of anaction for malicious prosecution.  The plaintiff had been convicted before a magistrate of stealing a pair of sandals from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  That conviction was set aside on appeal.  The judge found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded damages of $240,370.00which sum has been paid into court.  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, this appeal was dismissed with reasons to begiven in writing.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff is a Sri Lankan National and was employed as a domestic helper by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs husband.  The employment commenced on 2 December 2001 and ended on 10 January 2002.  The employment was effected throughan agency which was operated by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and her husband.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has taken no part in this action since August 2004 when her defence and counterclaim were struck out in her absence.  Judgmentwas entered against her with damages to be assessed. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Although the plaintiff left the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs home in early January 2002 her luggage was kept at the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs home and it was not until 31 March 2002 that the plaintiff went to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs home to collect her luggage.  It is not altogether clear why the plaintiff left her belongings at the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs home for quite so long.  What seems to have happened is that after the plaintiff left the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs home on 10 January she stayed the night at the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs home.  However, she did not trust that she would be allowed to stay in Hong Kong and therefore left the next morning. She returned there in the company of police officers on 15 January in order to retrieve her passport and her belongings.  The passportwas retrieved but the policemen were unable to assist the plaintiff to remove her belongings because they did not have transport.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  An important incident occurred on that occasion.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had called the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and informed her that the plaintiff was seeking to remove her luggage.  When the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant arrived there was some discussion.  There were differences between the versions given by the plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the two police officers.  The judge, having heard the evidence resolved those differences and accepted the evidenceof the police officers.  That evidence was that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had at first said that the plaintiff had stolen the earrings which she was wearing.  When the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant said that she had originally given the earrings to the plaintiff but that because the plaintiff was leaving her employmentshe felt she was entitled to have them back, one of the police officers explained that the plaintiffâs retention of the earringsdid not constitute theft.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant then accepted that explanation.  Although the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs evidence, in the subsequent prosecution for the theft of the sandals was slightly different it had some similaritiesto the police officersâ evidence.  The other important fact was that the police officers gave evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had then been asked whether anything else had been taken and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had said there had not.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  When the plaintiff arrived at the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs home on 31 March 2002 and sought to retrieve her belongings, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant apparently asked the plaintiff to open her luggage, which she did, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant saw the sandals which were the subject of the subsequent prosecution and reported the matter to the police.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant then inspected the sandals at the police station and claimed that the plaintiff had stolen them. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff was then prosecuted in the Magistrateâs Court and convicted and sentenced, despite the fact that the sandals wereonly worth something well under $1000, to three monthsâ imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On appeal the plaintiffâs conviction was set aside.  The judge hearing the appeal did so primarily on the basis that the policeofficersâ evidence had not been revealed to the defence and, as the judge recorded, the prosecution conceded that there had beena miscarriage of justice.  It was in those circumstances that this action was commenced.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The judge below heard evidence not only from the plaintiff but from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the police officers.  The judge also heard evidence from another Sri Lankan domestic helper, Nalani, who had been employedin the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs household immediately prior to the plaintiffâs employment.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In a careful judgment the judge recounted all the evidence, commenting that much of it was peripheral.  He was careful to assesseach part of each witnessâs evidence and, it is important to note, he gave reasons for accepting various parts and doubting otherparts of what each witness said.  His conclusion was summarised in paragraph 86 of his judgment where he said that he was satisfiedon a balance of probabilities and, indeed, bearing in mind that the more serious the allegation the less likely it was that the eventhad occurred, that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had given the sandals to the plaintiff as a gift and subsequently gave false evidence against her as did the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On this appeal Mr Suen, who appeared on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, sought to argue that because the plaintiff had only been successful on appeal after conviction and the judge had not ordereda retrial, the plaintiff had not established that the prosecution had been determined in her favour.  In my view that argument issimply wrong.  The conviction was set aside on appeal.  That is the end of the matter.  There was a prosecution and that had beendetermined in favour of the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The other ingredients of the tort of malicious prosecution as set out in the case of <i>Martin v Watson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 74</a> at p 80 are that the prosecution was without reasonable and probable cause and that it was malicious.  Given the finding of factat paragraph 86 of the judgment it was necessary for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to establish that the judge had come to the wrong conclusion as to fact.  Mr Suen sought to do so by first of all by referringto the evidence of Nalani, the domestic helper who had been employed in the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs household prior to the plaintiff.  Part of her evidence had been that the sandals, in respect of which the plaintiffhad been prosecuted, had originally been given to her but that she had left them behind at the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs home.  The judge below was highly sceptical of Nalaniâs evidence because she had said that she had been telephonedbefore leaving Sri Lanka and asked the size of her shoe so that the sandals could be purchased but that when she arrived the sandalswere the wrong size.  In my view this is an example of precisely the care with which the judge approached the judgment.  He did notaccept everything that was said but was careful to assess the evidence.  The judge was well aware of the plaintiffâs own evidencethat when being given the sandals she had been told that they had been left behind by the previous maid.  The fact that Nalaniâsevidence was not accepted does not in any way, impinge upon the conclusion to which the judge came that the plaintiff had, indeed,been given the sandals.  The judgeâs function is to find the facts.  In doing so he may accept or reject all or any part of theevidence.  It is not the function of this court to disturb the weighing exercise that the judge has to perform.  This court can onlyalter a finding of fact if satisfied that that finding was wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In short I do not consider that there is any valid basis for disturbing the judgeâs conclusion as to the gift of the sandals. Once the judge had held that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had indeed given the sandals to the plaintiff, it can only follow that the prosecution of the plaintiff was vindictiveand without any basis.  Since the allegation and evidence of theft emanated from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant there can be no basis for disputing that the prosecution was indeed malicious and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was responsible.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Waung J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Barma J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(William Waung)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Aarif Barma)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Y L Cheung, instructed by Messrs Ho, Tse, Wai &amp; Partners, for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>        <p>Mr Jenkin Suen, instructed by Messrs Lo, Wong &amp; Tsui, for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant/Appellant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2005/208.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
