It was said to derivein part from the 1st Defendant having told the estate agent dealing with the transaction about the structures and also from the corporatestructure of the Plaintiff.  It appears that the Plaintiffâs two directors and shareholders are respectively Guide Light SecretarialLimited (âGuide Lightâ) and Success Town Limited and that Mr Christopher Kok Lap Seng (âMr Kokâ), a partner in Kok &amp;Ha, is a shareholder of Guide Light and a director of one of its two corporate directors, Brave Light Industries Limited.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendants also contend that the Plaintiff was in breach of the Provisional Agreement in failing to withdraw its requisitionsregarding the cockloft and the split-level design being illegal structures by the deadline imposed by the Defendants, as a resultof which they suffered loss and damage which they counterclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It is convenient to deal with the Defendantsâ counterclaim before considering the defence based on the implied term entitlingthe Defendants to annul the Provisional Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The obligation to show a good title and the right to raise requisitions</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Although the Provisional Agreement does not contain an express term requiring the Defendants to show and give good title to theProperty free from encumbrances or requiring them to answer requisitions reasonably raised by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff pleadsthat these obligations were to be implied by law in the agreement.  I agree.  The implication of such terms is clearly supportedby the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Active Keen Industries Ltd. v. Fok Chi-keong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20HKLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 HKLR 396</a> at 405 where Litton JA said:-</p>    <blockquote>         <p class="quote">âAll the leading textbooks on the subject show that, in an âopenâ contract â that is to say, a contract formed by agreementwhich stipulates for nothing more than the parties, the property and the price â a number of conditions are implied, one of whichis that the vendor will <i>show</i> a good title.  For instance, see <i>Emmet on Title</i>, paragraph 2.072, <i>Barnsleyâs Conveyancing Law and Practice</i> (3rd ed.) p.245-6, <i>Williams on Title</i> (4th ed.) p.565.  See also <i>Link Brain v. Fujian Finance</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20HKLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 HKLR 353</a> at 368B.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>          <p class="quote">Whilst I expressed hesitation in the course of the hearing of this appeal on this point, I am satisfied that even though the Chineseagreement is wholly silent on the question of objections and requisitions as to title, there is an obligation on the vendor to <i>show</i> a good title.  This obligation arises by necessary implication from the contract itself.  This accords with common-sense.  Were thelaw otherwise, the purchaser might be left in the position of having to make a snap decision on the day fixed for completion, onscanty information, as to whether to complete or not.  It follows that this obligation falling on the vendor to properly answer requisitionsand inquiries, if reasonably raised by the purchaser, must be discharged within a reasonable time, to enable the purchaser to satisfyhimself on the matter, get his money ready and complete on the day fixed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Defendants contend in their Re-Amended Counterclaim that the non-completion of the Provisional Agreement was brought about bythe Plaintiffâs failure to withdraw its requisitions relating to the cockloft and split-level design before the deadline imposedby the Defendants.  This argument is discrete from the defence based on the alleged implied term, which is addressed below, and,in my view, is without merit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  By reason of the terms to be implied into the Provisional Agreement by law, as explained in <i>Active Keen Industries Ltd.</i> (supra.), the Plaintiff was entitled to raise queries and requisitions regarding the cockloft and split-level design in the Propertyas it did through its solicitors as from 25 March 2004.  If the cockloft and split-level design were not unauthorised structures,the requisitions could and should have been duly answered; if they were unauthorised structures, the Plaintiff was entitled to raisethe question of an abatement of price on the footing that a conveyance of the Property with the cockloft and split-level design removedwould result in the conveyance of a much smaller Property than it had bargained to purchase.  Its refusal to withdraw the queriesand requisitions by the deadline imposed by the Defendants was neither wrongful nor in repudiation of the Provisional Agreement. If the Provisional Agreement was subject to the implied term contended for by the Defendants, then the Plaintiffâs queries andrequisitions might lead to the Defendants being able to exercise their right to annul the sale but it would not, in my opinion, supportthe contention that the Plaintiff was in repudiatory breach of the Provisional Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Accordingly, regardless of the disposition of the issue based on the alleged implied term entitling the Defendants to annul theProvisional Agreement, I do not consider that the Plaintiff was in repudiatory breach of the Provisional Agreement by raising itsrequisitions relating to the cockloft and split-level design and the Defendantsâ counterclaim therefore stands to be dismissedin any event.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Could the Defendants show and give a good title to the Property?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In <i>Giant River Ltd. v.

On 25 January 2005,Chan &amp; Tsu wrote to Kok &amp; Ha stating that âwe take the facts that in the pleadings the parties are not in dispute of thatissue, there is no necessity to call for the expert to prove for the same in that particular issueâ.

Therefore, they could not show a goodtitle to the Property and, provided the Provisional Agreement was not annulled by reason of the Defendantsâ Memorandum of Annulmentdated 15 April 2004, the Plaintiff is entitled to the declaration sought in paragraph (1) of the prayer in the Amended Statementof Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The implied term contended for</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Whether the Defendantsâ Memorandum of Annulment dated 15 April 2004 was or was not effective depends on whether the ProvisionalAgreement was subject to the implied term contended for by the Defendants as set out in paragraph 19 above.  Mr Hui submitted thatthe term was to be implied into the Provisional Agreement on one of three bases: (i) in order to give business efficacy to the contract;(ii) on the basis of the âofficious bystanderâ test; and (iii) on the basis that this was an âincomplete contractâ and thecourt should establish what the contract is, the parties not having themselves fully stated the terms.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I shall deal below with each of the bases for implication of the term in question contended for by the Defendants.  It is firstnecessary to deal with certain aspects of the factual evidence concerning the transaction because Mr Hui invites me to find thatthe Plaintiff knew of the existence and potentially illegal nature of the cockloft and split-level design in the Property prior toentering into the Provisional Agreement.  He submitted that such knowledge on the part of the Plaintiff was material to the questionof whether the Provisional Agreement was subject to the implied term contended for.  He referred to a passage in <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 29th Ed., Vol. 1 at para. 13-007 in support of the relevance of knowledge in the context of implying a term on the basis of theâofficious bystanderâ test.  That passage reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<b>Obvious inference from agreement.</b>  A term which has not been expressed may also be implied if it was so obviously a stipulation in the agreement that the parties musthave intended it for form part of their contract.  âPrima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not beexpressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if while the parties were making their bargain, an officiousbystander were to suggest some provision for it in the agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common, âoh, of course.ââ A term will not, however, thus be implied unless the court is satisfied that <i>both</i> parties would, as reasonable men, have agreed to it had it been suggested to them.  <i>The knowledge or ignorance of each party of the matter to be implied, or of the facts on which the implication is based, is thereforea relevant factor.</i>  â¦â (Emphasis added.)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Plaintiffâs knowledge of the existence of the cockloft and the split-level design</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The only witness of fact for the Plaintiff was Mr Andrew Chan, the Plaintiffâs manager.  It was his evidence that he was telephonedby an estate agent, Mr Ricky Yau (âRicky Yauâ), on 5 March 2004 and invited to invest in the Property.  He said that Ricky Yautold him that there was a lot of interest in the Property, which was a good investment as it was tenanted, and urged him to act quickly. As a result, Mr Chan went to look at the Property that day but did not go inside it.  In his oral evidence he said he noticed acockloft inside the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In his witness statement, he stated that, when he went to see the Property on 5 March 2004, he noticed the rear portion of the Propertywas slightly lower than the front portion, but he did not expressly mention the cockloft in that statement.  In his statement, MrChan stated that on or about 23 March 2004 when the title deeds for the Property had been provided by Chan &amp; Tsu to Kok &amp;Ha, he noticed from the floor plan that there was no reference to the split-level design in the Property and so he went back to lookat the Property and noticed that apart from the split-level design there was a cockloft at the rear portion of the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Hui submitted that this was an important discrepancy between Mr Chanâs oral evidence and his witness statement.  He submittedthat the truth was that he had knowledge of the cockloft prior to signing the Provisional Agreement, as he had acknowledged in hisoral evidence, and that the discrepancy was evidence that his witness statement was untruthful.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Mr Hui also submitted that Mr Chanâs evidence concerning what Ricky Yau had told him about the Property in his telephone conversationon 5 March 2004 was also inconsistent.  In his witness statement, Mr Chan did not mention whether Ricky Yau had informed him aboutthe cockloft and split-level design.  In his evidence in chief, he confirmed that Ricky Yau had not said anything about the cockloft. However, during his cross-examination, when it was suggested to him that Ricky Yau had told him about both the cockloft and thesplit-level design, Mr Chan said that Ricky Yau had informed him there was a cockloft but did not mention that the rear portion ofthe Property was lower than the front portion.  This answer was corrected by Mr Chan almost immediately by his clarifying that RickyYau did not in fact mention either the cockloft or the split-level design, leading Mr Hui to suggest that Mr Chan was retractinghis evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Huiâs submission in regard to Mr Chan was that he lied regarding his knowledge of the cockloft and the split-level design. In the Defendantsâ written closing submissions this was said to be âbecause he wished to conceal the fact that both [Mr Kokand Mr Chan], before the signing of the [Provisional Agreement], already knew about the existence of the Cockloft and split-leveldesign and their possible legal consequencesâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Before stating my findings in relation to the evidence of Mr Chan, it is necessary to refer to the evidence concerning Mr Kok, whowas not called to give evidence for the Plaintiff, and Mr Huiâs submissions regarding Mr Kok.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Chan gave evidence that, after Ricky Yau telephoned him and he had been to see the Property, he decided that the Property wasa good investment and so, having obtained verbal authority from his boss, a Mr Paulo Ho, he proceeded to sign the Provisional Agreementon behalf of the Plaintiff.  It was Mr Chanâs evidence that Mr Ho was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Plaintiff and that MrKok took no part in the Plaintiffâs decision to purchase the Property and had no interest in the transaction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Having signed the Provisional Agreement, Mr Chan telephoned Mr Kok in order to obtain a cheque for the payment of the initial depositin the sum of $300,000.  He did not seek legal advice at this time but instead merely asked Mr Kok to issue a cheque on behalf ofthe Plaintiff.  Mr Chan said he did not tell Mr Kok about the cockloft and split-level design in the Property as there was no needfor him to tell him about these features.  Mr Chanâs evidence was that it was his usual practice to contact Mr Kok when he neededmoney for the Plaintiffâs property investments but he had no idea as to whether Mr Kok had any personal interest in the transactionshe had previously entered into.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As noted above, the Plaintiffâs two directors and shareholders are respectively Guide Light and Success Town Limited and Mr Kokis a shareholder of Guide Light and a director of one of its two corporate directors, Brave Light Industries Limited.  Mr Chanâsevidence was that Mr Kok and Guide Light provided the Plaintiff with secretarial services and nominee director services but it didnot participate in the Plaintiffâs investments.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Mr Hui submitted that Mr Kok must have had some personal gain in the present transaction.  He submitted that solicitors do not simplyissue cheques for transactions in which they do not have any benefit.  Mr Hui invited the Court to draw the inference that therewas no reasonable explanation for Mr Kokâs involvement other than that he was actually involved in the business of the Plaintiff. There was no evidence, he said, that Mr Kok was only a nominee shareholder and no evidence, apart from Mr Chanâs bare assertionthat Mr Ho was involved in the Plaintiff or that he even existed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Hui submitted that, given Mr Chanâs awareness of the potential problems caused by cocklofts, it was difficult to accept thathe would not have mentioned the existence of the cockloft and split-level design of the Property to Mr Kok when he spoke to him toask for the cheque for the initial deposit.  At the same time, it would have been natural for him to seek legal advice from Mr Kokabout the cockloft and split-level design.  In this regard, the Defendants referred to two cases involving property disputes in whichMr Kok had acted as an advocate and in which he had submitted that there was a duty on the part of a vendor to make full disclosureof the existence of unauthorized structures or unpermitted user.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I have carefully considered the submissions in support of the Defendantsâ contention that Mr Chan and Mr Kok were both aware ofthe existence of the cockloft and split-level design of the Property before the Provisional Agreement was signed and that they werealso aware of âtheir possible legal consequencesâ as Mr Hui put it.  By that phrase, I understood the Defendantsâ submissionto be that both Mr Chan and Mr Kok were aware of the fact that the cockloft and split-level design were in fact unauthorised structuresby reason of which the Defendants would not be able to show and give a good title to the Property (see above).  I have particularlyconsidered the question of whether I should draw any adverse inferences from the failure of the Plaintiff to adduce evidence fromMr Paulo Ho to corroborate his beneficial ownership of the Plaintiff to the exclusion of Mr Kok or from Mr Kok to corroborate thenominee basis on which he was said to have acted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  I have concluded, however, that there is no sufficient basis for accepting the submission that Mr Chan was lying in his evidenceor that he was doing so to camouflage the fact that he and Mr Kok were both aware of the fact that the cockloft and split-level designof the Property were unauthorised structures.  I do not consider that there was any material discrepancy between Mr Chanâs oralevidence and his witness statement concerning what he saw when he first went to see the Property.  I find that Mr Chan did go toview the Property on 5 March 2004 after he was contacted by Ricky Yau with a view to buying the Property for the Plaintiff.  I furtherfind that he did notice both the cockloft and the split-level design in the Property, the two features being in effect two partsof the same feature in the sense that it was because the floor level at the rear of the Property was lowered that there was sufficientroom for the cockloft to be constructed.  However, I find that he was not aware that the cockloft and split-level design were unauthorisedstructures.  The mere existence of a cockloft and a split-level design in a property do not necessarily mean that those featuresare illegal structures.  I do not consider that Mr Chan was lying when he retracted his answer concerning what Ricky Yau told himabout the Property: I accept that he was genuinely mistaken as to the question that led him to answer initially that Ricky Yau hadmentioned the cockloft.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I find that Mr Kok was not personally involved in the transaction and that his involvement in Guide Light and Brave Light IndustriesLimited is on a nominee basis for Mr Ho.  I accept Mr Chanâs evidence that he did not mention the cockloft and split-level designof the Property to Mr Kok when he spoke to him by telephone on 5 March 2004 to ask for a cheque for the initial deposit, nor didhe ask Mr Kok for legal advice at that stage.  Even if he had, there is no reason to suppose that Mr Kok would have made any assumptionas to the legality or otherwise of those features: it would simply have been premature for him to express any view on them beforeseeing the title deeds and plans.  The mere fact that Mr Kok is a solicitor who has acted in relation to property disputes involvingunauthorised structures could not, in my view, have fixed him with knowledge that the particular cockloft and split-level designin this Property were unauthorised structures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In reaching these findings as to the Plaintiffâs state of knowledge, I have not overlooked the evidence of the 1st Defendant,Mr Chau Tak Hing (âMr Chauâ).  Mr Chauâs evidence was that he was aware that the cockloft and split-level design were unauthorisedstructures and had been so aware since the time he purchased the Property in 2002.  At the time of that transaction, he learned ofthat the cockloft and split-level design were unauthorised structures, as had Chan &amp; Tsu who had acted for him when the Defendantspurchased the Property.  He gave evidence, which I accept, that he informed Ricky Yau about the cockloft and split-level design bywhich I understood him to have told Ricky Yau that these were unauthorised structures.  I also accept that he requested Ricky Yauto tell the Plaintiff about this.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  However, I do not find that Ricky Yau ever told the Plaintiff that the cockloft and split-level design were unauthorised structures. In addition to Mr Chanâs evidence that Ricky Yau did not do so, there are a number of other factors that lead me to this conclusion. First, Mr Chau accepted in cross-examination that he told Ricky Yau that the cockloft and split-level design were unauthorised structuresat a time when the Plaintiff had already signed the Provisional Agreement so that there would have been little incentive for RickyYau to have informed the Plaintiff.  Secondly, Mr Chau accepted he could not be sure that Ricky Yau had informed the Plaintiff ofthis fact and Mr Chau did not clarify with him whether he ever did so.  Thirdly, Ricky Yau was not called to give evidence to confirmthat he had done what Mr Chau had asked him to do.  Finally, Mr Chau candidly accepted that he had never dealt with the Plaintiff,had never met him (by which I took him to mean Mr Chan), so that he did not know if the Plaintiff was aware that the cockloft andsplit-level design were unauthorised structures before the Provisional Agreement was signed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I should add that I do not accept Mr Chauâs evidence that because the staircase leading to the cockloft was a wooden structureit would have been obvious to someone inspecting the Property with a view to buying it that this was a structure for which permissionhad not been applied and that, because the shops adjacent to the Property did not have a split-level design, it should have beenobvious that the split-level design was unauthorised.  When it was put to him in cross-examination that it was not possible to telljust by looking at the outward appearance of the cockloft and split-level design that no permission had been granted in respect ofthem, he responded that he had âno commentâ.  He accepted that not all cocklofts were illegal structures; nor did he suggestthat all split-level designs were illegal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Is the implied term contended for to be implied in the Provisional Agreement to give it business efficacy?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The Defendantsâ case is that the implied term contended for should be implied into the Provisional Agreement in order to giveit business efficacy.  As I understood the Defendantsâ case, it was said to be necessary to imply the term in question into thecontract because of the different stages of a conveyancing transaction in Hong Kong: the first stage being the signing of a provisionalagreement and payment of initial deposit, which then leads on to the stage of the raising of requisitions in relation to title bythe purchaser and the answering of the requisitions by the vendor, both of which stages might be before or after the signing of aformal sale and purchase agreement and then the final stage of completion.  Mr Hui submitted that the implication of the term ofannulment contended for was necessary and reasonable in the present circumstances because there was no âescapeâ clause in theProvisional Agreement enabling the Defendants to back out of the transaction by returning the initial deposit and an equivalent sumas liquidated damages at the requisitions stage.  He submitted that it would âflout common business senseâ not to imply a rightto annul the sale in circumstances in which the Plaintiff was entitled to raise requisitions regarding defects in title of whichit was or should have been aware.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  It is well established that a term will not be implied into a contract unless it satisfies the test of necessity.  As to that, in<i>Tai Hing</i> <i>Cotton Mill Ltd. v. Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 AC 80</a>, the Privy Council held (at 104H-105B):-</p>    <blockquote>       <p class="quote">âTheir Lordships agree with Cons J.A. that the test of implication is necessity.  As Lord Wilberforce put it in <i>Liverpool City</i> <i>Council v. Irwin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] A.C. 239</a>, 254:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>         <p class="quote">âsuch obligation should be read into the contract as the nature of the contract itself implicitly requires, no more, no less: atest, in other words, of necessity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Cons J.A. went on to quote an observation by Lord Salmon in the <i>Liverpool</i> case to the effect that the term sought to be implied must be one without which the whole transaction would become âinefficacious,futile and absurdâ (p.262).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>         <p class="quote">Their Lordships accept as correct the approach adopted by Cons J.A.  Their Lordships prefer it to that suggested by Hunter J. whichwas to ask the question: does the law impose the term?  Implication is the way in which necessary incidents come to be recognisedin the absence of express agreement in a contractual relationship.  Imposition is apt to describe a duty arising in tort, but ineptto describe the necessary incident arising from a contractual relationship.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I do not regard the implied term contended for as necessary in order for the Provisional Agreement to be workable.  The Defendantsâobligation under the Provisional Agreement is to show a good title to the Property and, upon completion, to give a good title tothe Property by conveying it to the Plaintiff free from encumbrances.  There is no need, in order for this to occur, for the Defendantsto have an option to cancel the contract in the event that they consider it inconvenient to do so.  In the circumstances of thiscase, which include my finding that the Plaintiff did not have knowledge of any defect in title by reason of the cockloft and split-leveldesign in the Property, it is simply not the case that the Provisional Agreement is âinefficacious, futile or absurdâ withoutthe implied term contended for.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I therefore do not consider that the implied term contended for must be implied to give business efficacy to the Provisional Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Is the implied term contended for to be implied in the Provisional Agreement on the basis of the âofficious bystanderâ test?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In cross-examination, Mr Chan acknowledged that he was experienced in property investment and that he had seen problems caused byunauthorised cocklofts.  He was aware that they could cause financial loss.  He said that, had he known that the cockloft and split-leveldesign in the present case were unauthorised, he would not have purchased the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It was submitted by Mr Hui that, in the light of Mr Chanâs evidence and the fact that the Defendants were aware that the cockloftand split-level design were in fact unauthorised, both parties would have agreed that the implied term contended for was so obviousthat it went without saying.  He submitted that the fact that Mr Chau informed Ricky Yau that the cockloft and split-level designwere unauthorised structures showed that he wanted to sell the Property âwithout troublesâ.  Hence, it was argued that the impliedterm contended for satisfied the âofficious bystanderâ test propounded by MacKinnon LJ in <i>Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries Ltd</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%202%20KB%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1939] 2 KB 206</a> at 227.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr Hui referred also to the fact that in the draft formal sale and purchase agreement, the parties had incorporated a vendor rescissionclause in the same terms as the implied term contended for.  Although he acknowledged that this was not direct evidence of the partiesâintentions at the time when they entered into the Provisional Agreement, it did reflect their presumed intentions at that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I do not agree that the âofficious bystanderâ test is satisfied in the present case.  The implied term contended for is not,in my view, a straightforward and simply expressed term that the parties would, if asked at the time they signed the ProvisionalAgreement, have obviously assented to.  Even if it were more simply expressed, I do not consider that it is obvious in the circumstancesthat the Plaintiff would have agreed to its inclusion.  When Mr Chan said in cross-examination that, had he known the cockloft andsplit-level design in the Property were unauthorised structures, he would not have purchased the Property, I understood his answerto mean that he would not have accepted the conveyance of the Property with the unauthorised structures as the conveyance of a goodtitle to the Property.  I do not consider that I can or should read into his answer in cross-examination an intention on his partthat, should the Defendants find it onerous or inconvenient to give good title to the Property, they should be entitled to a rightof annulment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In order to discern the partiesâ presumed intentions, I must look to the express words in the Provisional Agreement.  There, theDefendants agreed to sell the Property free from encumbrances; the normal âescapeâ clause, which would have enabled the Defendantsto back out of the transaction, was expressly deleted.  In my judgment, this evidence of the partiesâ presumed intentions outweighsany inference that might be drawn from the subsequent fact that the parties might have executed a formal agreement that includeda vendor rescission clause.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I therefore do not consider that the implied term contended for must be implied in the Provisional Agreement on the basis of theâofficious bystanderâ test.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Is the implied term contended for to be implied on the basis that this was an âincomplete contractâ?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In <i>Twinkle Step Investment Ltd. v. Smart International Industrial Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%202%20HKCFAR%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 2 HKCFAR 255</a>, the Court of Final Appeal held that there was an implied term in a contract of sale of land that the purchaser is entitled, forthe purpose of ascertaining whether the vendor is delivering vacant possession, to view the premises immediately before he pays thebalance of the purchase price at completion.  As to the basis of the implication, Bokhary PJ held:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIn circumstances such as the present, the test is the one articulated by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Liverpool City Council v.

Under this test, the question is whether the term contended for is one which the Court must imply in order to establish what thecontract is, the parties themselves not having fully stated the terms of their contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr Hui submitted that the implied term contended for should similarly be implied on the above basis into the Provisional Agreementbecause it was an incomplete contract.  This submission was again based on the evidence, referred to above, that Mr Chau wanted tosell the Property without the purchaser having a right to complain about the cockloft or split-level design and that Mr Chan wouldnot have wanted to purchase the Property if he had known there were unauthorised structures in it.  This evidence was said to reflectthe partiesâ intentions and therefore, it was submitted, the Provisional Agreement required the implied term contended for in orderto make it complete.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I do not consider that the Provisional Agreement was an incomplete contract.  The terms of that agreement are clear enough and,even if the parties were not to go on to execute a formal sale and purchase agreement, the terms of the Provisional Agreement wouldbe sufficient for its purpose of achieving the sale of the Property by the Defendants to the Plaintiff.  I do not regard the evidenceas supporting the contention that the partiesâ intentions were that the Defendants should have a right to annul the sale in thecircumstances.  It does not appear that the point was considered by either Mr Chau or Mr Chan.  I am by no means satisfied that,had Mr Chan been asked to consider it, he would have agreed that when he entered into the Provisional Agreement he intended that,should the cockloft and split-level design be unauthorised structures, the Defendants should have a right to annul the sale.  Inshort, the evidence does not support the contention that the parties intended that the Provisional Agreement should include the impliedterm in question.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I therefore do not consider that the implied term contended for should be implied in the Provisional Agreement on the basis thatit is an âincomplete contractâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The implied term contended for is contrary to an express term of the Provsional Agreement</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  It is trite that an implied term must not contradict any express term of the contract: see <i>Lewison: The Interpretation of Contracts</i> (3rd Ed., 2004) Â§6.08 (pp.170-171).  To imply the term contended for in the present case would, in my view, be to imply a term thatwas inconsistent with the express provision in clause 3 of the Provisional Agreement, namely that â[t]he said premises is to besold to the Purchaser or its nominee(s), sub-purchaser(s) free from encumbrancesâ.  I do not agree with the Defendantsâ submissionthat this is concerned with a different matter at a different stage of the conveyancing transaction.  A contract must be completeat the time it is made.  When the Provisional Agreement was signed, the Defendants undertook to convey the Property free from encumbrances. The fact that the conveyance of the Property would take place at the end of the process, in terms of time, does not mean, in myopinion, that it is necessary to imply a right to back out of the transaction at an earlier stage in time just because the obligationto convey the Property free from encumbrances might have become onerous or inconvenient.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I would add, moreover, that even if (contrary to my finding above) the Plaintiff knew that the cockloft and split-level design constitutedunauthorised structures, the Defendants were, by clause 3, expressly obliged to convey the Property âfree from encumbrancesâ. In the circumstances, notice of the defect in title on the part of the Plaintiff would not relieve the Defendants of the obligationto give good title: see <i>Giant River Ltd. v. Asie Marketing Ltd.</i> (<i>supra</i>) at 312H-313B where Deputy Judge Cruden said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA 19th century high water mark of the protection given by Courts to purchasers, which has remained good law ever since, was reachedin the case of <i>In re Gloag and Millerâs Contract</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2023%20Ch%20D%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 23 Ch D 320</a> where it was held that if the contract, as here, expressly provides that a good title shall be shown, the purchaser is entitled toinsist on a good title, notwithstanding that before execution of the agreement, he had notice of defects in the vendorâs title.

The purchaser bought freehold property and in terms of thecontract the vendor had to make a good marketable title.  The title on the date for completion was subject to restrictive covenantswhich precluded the vendor from showing a good marketable title.  There was evidence that when the contract was signed the purchaserknew of the restrictive covenants.  The Court of Appeal held that whether the purchaser had such knowledge was irrelevant becausethe vendor had contracted to make a good marketable title and the obligation was contractually on him to take such steps as werenecessary so as to provide, on the date for completion, a good marketable title.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The implied term contended for would therefore be contradictory to the express requirement on the part of the Defendants pursuantto clause 3 of the Provisional Agreement to convey the Property free from encumbrances and, for this additional reason, I hold thatthe implied term contended for is not to be implied into the Provisional Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion as to liability</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I hold that there was no implied term in the Provisional Agreement entitling the Defendants to annulthat agreement.  Accordingly, the Defendantsâ Memorandum of Annulment dated 15 April 2004 was ineffective to annul the ProvisionalAgreement.  Instead, the service of that Memorandum amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Provisional Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Plaintiff is accordingly entitled to a declaration that the cockloft and the split-level design constitute an illegal structureand/or unauthorised building works or alterations giving rise to a real risk of enforcement action by the Building Authority andtherefore a defect in the title of the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In the circumstances, the Plaintiff was entitled either to accept the repudiation and bring the Provisional Agreement to an endor to keep the contract alive and sue for specific performance as it has by the present action.  It is now necessary to considerwhether specific performance should be ordered (and if so, on what basis) or whether the Plaintiff should instead be awarded damagesin lieu.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Appropriate remedy</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  It was common ground between the parties that, in the event the Court were to find in favour of the Plaintiff on the issue of liability,the Court would have a discretion to grant an order for specific performance of the Provisional Agreement.  The Provisional Agreementbeing a contract for the sale of land, it is right that, unless the Defendants establish one of the discretionary bars to it, specificperformance is the appropriate remedy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As to whether or not the Court should grant specific performance, the only basis on which the Defendants contended that specificperformance should not be granted was on the ground that the Plaintiff did not come to Court with âclean handsâ.  The basis forthis contention was the Defendantsâ submission that the Plaintiff was aware of the existence of the cockloft and the split-leveldesign and was also aware that these were unauthorised structures before signing the Provisional Agreement.  As I have found thatthe Plaintiff did not know that the cockloft and split-level design of the Property constituted unauthorised structures before signingthe Provisional Agreement (see above), there is no basis for concluding that the Plaintiff has come to Court with âuncleanâ handsand so I reject this argument as a basis for refusing specific performance and restricting the Plaintiff to damages in lieu.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  As noted above, the Plaintiffâs two alternative claims for specific performance were:-</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Specific 			performance of the Provisional Agreement subject to the 			reinstatement of the Property by the removal of the cockloftand the 			split-level design together with compensation (in the form of an 			abatement of the purchase price to reflect the lossof usable area 			due to reinstatement) and/or damages (for loss of use of the 			Property since the date of completion); or</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Alternatively, 			specific performance of the Provisional Agreement without 			reinstatement together with compensation (in theform of an 			abatement of the purchase price to reflect the reduction in the 			value of the Property by reason of the cockloftand split-level 			design being illegal structures) and/or damages (for loss of use of 			the Property since the date of completion).</td>		</tr>	</table></blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The Property is presently tenanted by a Ms Ng pursuant to a lease which will not expire until 30 April 2006.  Mr Chauâs evidence,which I accept, is that it will be disruptive to Ms Ng for the Property to be reinstated by the removal of the cockloft and split-leveldesign.  His evidence was that she has stock in the Property and is operating her business there.  Ms Tong submitted that there wasno evidence of any hardship to Ms Ng if reinstatement were to be ordered.  I do not agree.  Although Ms Ng might have been calledto give evidence to confirm this fact, I think it is a reasonable inference from the available evidence that the removal of the cockloftand split-level design would be disruptive to her and her business.  As such, I decline to order specific performance of the ProvisionalAgreement with reinstatement by the removal of the cockloft and split-level design.  Instead, I propose to order specific performanceon the alternative basis sought by the Plaintiff, namely specific performance without reinstatement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Compensation in addition to specific performance by reason of the defective title</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  It was also common ground between the parties that the Court could award compensation in addition to specific performance in theevent the Plaintiff was not adequately compensated by an order for specific performance by reason of the defective title to the Propertyconstituted by the presence of the unauthorised structures.  The availability of such compensation in an action by a purchaser forspecific performance, by way of an abatement of the purchase price, is well supported: see <i>Jones &amp; Goodhart: Specific</i> <i>Performance</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed.) pp. 275-276 &amp; 293-295, <i>Spry: The Principles of</i> <i>Equitable Remedies</i> (6<sup>th</sup> Ed.) pp. 302 &amp; 307-308, and <i>Topfell Ltd. v.

As I have determined that an order for specific performance should be made on the basis of no reinstatement ofthe Property by the removal of the cockloft and split-level design, the appropriate amount of compensation should be such as to representthe reduction in the value of the Property by reason of the cockloft and split-level design being illegal structures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  I should add, in this context, that it was also common ground between the parties that the date of assessment of any compensationto be awarded in addition to specific performance should be the date of judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Both parties adduced expert valuation evidence in respect of the Property.  The Plaintiffâs expert was Mr Memfus Wong of MemfusWong Surveyors Limited, who adopted the report dated 11 March 2005 of his colleague, Ms Sat Wei-ling.  The latter was unable to giveevidence for the Plaintiff due to reasons of ill-health.  Mr Wong also prepared a supplemental valuation report dated 15 November2004.  The Defendantâs expert was Mr Alfred Ngo of CS Surveyors Limited, who prepared three valuation reports dated 26 May 2005,21 November 2005 and 25 November 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Before commenting on the evidence of the partiesâ respective experts, it is convenient to indicate the amounts claimed by thePlaintiff based on the valuations of the Property proffered by its expert, Mr Wong.</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">In the event 			that specific performance with reinstatement was to be ordered 			(which I decline to order), the Plaintiff claimedcompensation in 			the amount of the difference between the open market value of the 			Property as at November 2005 (with theunauthorised structures but assuming them to be authorised) less the open market value of the Property as at November 2005 (withoutthe unauthorised structures, i.e. after reinstatement).

As noted above, Mr Wong opined that the former value is $9,160,000and his opinion was that the latter value is $8,590,000 producing a difference of $570,000.</td>		</tr>	</table></blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In contrast, the Defendant contended that the valuations of Mr Ngo, which were lower than those of Mr Wong, should be used in thecalculation of compensation.  Mr Wong opined that the current market value of the Property on the assumption that the cockloft andsplit-level design were authorised is $8,300,000.  He opined that the current market value of the Property without the cockloft andsplit-level design is $7,570,000.  As I understood Mr Hui, the Defendantâs contention was that, if specific performance was orderedwithout reinstatement, no compensation should be awarded in addition to specific performance since the value of the Property hadincreased since the date of the Provisional Agreement (Â§18 of the Defendantsâ written closing submission in respect of quantum). When questioned on whether this contention was really tenable (and I do not think it is), I understood Mr Huiâs fallback argumentto be that the amount of any compensation in addition to specific performance should be the difference between the two valuationfigures of Mr Ngo reflecting the value of the cockloft and split-level design, namely the sum of $730,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  It will be immediately apparent that, ironically, if compensation is to be awarded by reference to the difference in the estimatedvalues of the Property with and without the unauthorised structures, there is in fact no advantage to the Defendant in the Courtpreferring Mr Ngoâs valuations to those of Mr Wong: on Mr Wongâs calculations, the compensation would be $570,000, whereas onMr Ngoâs calculations, the compensation would be $730,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  The Plaintiff did not invite me to disregard Mr Wongâs valuations and instead to prefer Mr Ngoâs valuations.  Accordingly, thereis strictly no need for me to express a view as to which expertâs opinions as to value I prefer.  However, for the sake of completeness,I propose to indicate briefly why, had it been necessary for me to decide between them, I would have preferred the evidence of MrWong to that of Mr Ngo.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I was impressed with the clarity and cogency of the evidence of Mr Wong, who has 28 years experience in the valuation of propertiesin Hong Kong.  Although Mr Ngo also has considerable valuation experience, of over 12 years, there were a number of respects in whichI considered his evidence to be less reliable than that of Mr Wong: (i) he accepted that he made a number of mistakes in calculatingtime adjustments to various of his comparables in his 1st report due to having not used the appropriate versions of the retail priceindices published by the Rating and Valuation Department; (ii) it appeared that he ignored the elements of headroom and visibilityin making adjustments to the comparables he used in his reports; (iii) I consider that he gave too much weight to comparable 2 inAppendix D2 to his 1st report; (iv) there seemed to be an inconsistency between his 1st report and his 3rd report in respect of histaking into account the time factor in determining the weightings of his comparables; (v) I do not think his location adjustmentsfor comparables 3 and 4 in Appendix II to his 3rd report were sufficient; (vi) I prefer Mr Wongâs view that an adjustment for layoutought to be made using the âhalving-backâ principle and this was not done by Mr Ngo in relation to his comparables; (vii) I wasdoubtful that he made due adjustment for layout in respect of the comparables used in his three reports (correspondingly, I do notthink that Mr Wongâs adjustments suffered from the vice of double-counting as suggested by Mr Ngo).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate amount of compensation to be awarded to the Plaintiff in addition to specificperformance is the sum of $570,000 to reflect the diminution in the value of the Property by reason of the presence of the unauthorisedstructures which it will most likely be liable to remove in the future so that it will be left with a much smaller property thanit had originally contracted to purchase.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Compensation in addition to specific performance: loss of use of the Property</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The Plaintiff also claims damages for loss of use of the Property from the date on which the sale transaction should have been completeduntil the actual date when the Property is conveyed pursuant to an order for specific performance.  The Plaintiffâs claim for damagesfor loss of use was quantified on the basis of Mr Ngoâs assessment of the current market rental of the Property without the cockloftand split-level design, which he assessed to be $39,130 per month (being the current market rental of $43,000 per month less 9% toreflect the cockloft and split-level design).  Thus, the Plaintiff claims $39,130 per month for loss of use as from 30 June 2004and continuing until the actual date when the Property is conveyed pursuant to an order for specific performance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Although it was not disputed by the Defendants that the Plaintiff could maintain a claim for damages for loss of enjoyment of theProperty, it remains for the Court to be satisfied that such an award is appropriate both as a matter of principle and on the evidenceadduced.  As a matter of principle, a claim for loss of use of the Property is certainly maintainable by the Plaintiff: see <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (17<sup>th</sup> Ed.) para. 22-041.  However, the proof of such a claim is not, in my judgment, simply a matter of calculating the rent which wouldhave been payable to the Plaintiff as from the original date of completion until the date when the Property is actually conveyedpursuant to an order for specific performance.  It remains necessary, in my view, for the Plaintiff to establish by evidence theactual loss suffered by it as a result of the delay in the conveyance of the Property to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Other than the payment of the initial deposit in the sum of $300,000, the Plaintiff has not yet expended the purchase price forthe Property.  The Plaintiff was purchasing the Property for investment purposes and not for its own use.  No evidence was led asto whether the Plaintiff was proposing to fund the purchase from available cash or by way of borrowed funds and, if the latter, onwhat terms such funds would be borrowed.  If it was going to borrow the funds, there was no evidence as to the interest liabilityit would incur on such borrowed funds.  If the purchase was going to be financed by borrowed funds, the Plaintiff would receive awindfall if damages were to be awarded on the basis claimed by the Plaintiff without taking into account its costs of borrowing. If, on the other hand, the purchase was going to be financed out of available cash, it would similarly give the Plaintiff a windfallif damages were to be awarded on the basis claimed by the Plaintiff without taking into account the sums earned by the Plaintiffon the alternative use or uses to which such cash has or could have been put in the meantime.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In my opinion, absent evidence to show what net loss has actually been caused by reason of the delay from the original date of completionto the date when the Property is actually conveyed pursuant to an order for specific performance, it would be inappropriate to makean award of damages under this head simply on the basis of the rental value of the Property, as claimed by the Plaintiff.  However,that does not mean that the Plaintiffâs claim under this head should be dismissed: to do that would be to assume, without any properevidential basis, that the Plaintiffâs net loss would be nil.  The Plaintiffâs Amended Statement of Claim seeks damages âtobe assessedâ and includes a claim for â[a]ll necessary and consequential assessmentsâ and so I therefore propose to directthat the Plaintiffâs claim for loss of use be directed to be assessed by a master in order to determine what sum should be setoff against the rent that would have been earned if the Property were conveyed to the Plaintiff on the original completion date. That sum will likely be either the interest cost that would have been incurred by the Plaintiff, if it was going to fund the purchaseby way of borrowed funds, or the interest it would have earned on its capital, if it was going to fund the purchase by way of availablecash.  I would note that this course, of directing an assessment of damages by a master, was adopted by Keith J in <i>Wellfit Investments Limited v. Poly Commence Limited</i>, HCA No.A8737 of 1990, unrep., 8.1.96.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Although the assessment of the Plaintiffâs loss of use will therefore be a matter for the master to assess, it is appropriatethat I indicate my view on the rental value proposed by the Plaintiff as the basis for its claim for loss of use.  In my opinion,the appropriate basis for an award of damages for loss of use in the present case should be the likely achievable rent during therelevant period of delay from 30 June 2004 on the footing that what was conveyed to the Plaintiff was the Property without the unauthorisedstructures: after all, had the Property been conveyed with a good title, the cockloft and split-level design would have needed tobe removed.  The Property was to have been sold subject to the tenancy in favour of Ms Ng for the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2006under which the monthly rental payable is $40,000 (and not $43,000, which is the current rental value).  The evidence of Mr Ngo isthat a reduction of 9% in the monthly rental is appropriate to reflect the removal of the cockloft and split-level design from theProperty.  If a 9% reduction were applied to the figure of $40,000, the result would be $36,400.  If I had been able to assess thePlaintiffâs loss of use, I would have adopted this monthly rental value of $36,400, rather than $39,130 as claimed by the Plaintiff,as the appropriate figure to be used as a starting point in calculating the net figure to be awarded to the Plaintiff by way of damagesfor loss of use during the relevant period of delay.  However, as I have stated, this is a matter for the master conducting the assessment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  On the Plaintiffâs claim, I therefore grant the declaration sought, namely a declaration that the cockloft and the split-leveldesign constitute an illegal structure and/or unauthorised building works or alterations giving rise to a real risk of enforcementaction by the Building Authority and therefore a defect in the title of the Property.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  I grant an order for specific performance of the Provisional Agreement without reinstatement of the cockloft and split-level designbut I award compensation in addition to specific performance in the sum of $570,000.  As to the form of the order, I direct the partiesto liaise with a view to agreeing an order incorporating all necessary and proper steps to achieve the completion of the sale andpurchase pursuant to the Provisional Agreement.  In the event that agreement on the form of the order cannot be reached, the partieswill, of course, have liberty to apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I direct that the Plaintiffâs damages for loss of use of the Property for the period from 30 June 2004 until the date when theProperty is actually conveyed to it pursuant to the order for specific performance be assessed by a master.  As the Plaintiff hasalso claimed interest, such assessment should also determine the period and rate for which any interest should be payable upon suchdamages for loss of use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I dismiss the Defendantsâ counterclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Costs</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I see no reason why the Defendants should not pay the Plaintiff its costs of this action to be taxed, if not agreed, and I makean order <i>nisi</i> to that effect.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>		<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(J Fok, SC)<br>        Recorder of the Court of First Instance<br>        of the High Court</td>	</tr>	</table>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation><p>Ms Sara Tong, instructed by Messrs Kok &amp; Ha, for the Plaintiff</p>    <p>Mr David Hui Tai Wai, instructed by Messrs Chan &amp; Tsu, for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants</p></representation><!--sino section text -->    <hr style="text-align:left" width="33%" />    <p style="text-align:justify"><a>[1]</a>   Although it was common ground in the partiesâ pleadings that the date for completion in the Provisional Agreement was 25 June2004, it would appear that the date actually agreed for completion was 30 June 2004: the original completion date in the ProvisionalAgreement was 25 June 2004 but this date was amended to 30 June 2004 and the parties appear to have agreed to this change of dateby initialling next to the amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align: justify"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2005/1236.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
