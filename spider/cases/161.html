At that time, all the Plaintiffs were employedas musicians (players) in the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (the Orchestra) by the Defendant which is a limited company. Theircontracts of employment were for the period 1st April 1977 to 31st March 1979. Towards the end of 1978, they received letters fromthe Defendant dated 12th December offering them extensions of four months to the 31st July 1979. All accepted. On the 3rd of June1979, all received letters informing them their contracts would not be renewed on expiry. The Plaintiffs then instituted proceedingsunder the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, but withdrew these and instead instituted High Court proceedings in action no. 3031 of 1979 claiming damages for wrongful dismissal,not upon the basis of a breach of contract but of representations made to them. On 18th December 1979, O'Connor J. struck out theStatement of Claim and dismissed the Plaintiffs' action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> In April 1980, the Plaintiffs commenced the present action. They claim in substance that in the early months of 1979, representationswere made to them by various senior officers and agents of the Defendant assuring them that their contracts would be renewed; thatnevertheless, on 3rd June 1979 they were each informed that on the advice of the new musical director, Mr. Ling TUNG, their contractswould not be renewed; that the representations were made with knowledge that they were false or that they were made recklessly notcaring whether they were true or false, and that the Plaintiffs relied upon those representations and in consequence suffered loss.Their claim which is for damages is denied by the Defendant. It is acknowledged that the main issue is accordingly whether the representationsalleged were in fact made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Originally, there were 15 Plaintiffs in this case, all legally aided. Some of them were subsequently denied legal aid and felt unableto provide the security for costs then applied for successfully by the Defendant upon those Plaintiffs departing for their home countries.One or two withdrew for other reasons. There are now only six Plaintiffs left, i.e. the lst, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 12th and 15th Plaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>The Contracts and their Extension</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is common ground that all six Plaintiffs entered into written contracts to serve as musicans playing their individual instrumentsfor the period of two years i.e. from 1st April 1977 to 31st March 1979. They were not all paid the same rates. In addition, onlythe 15th Plaintiff of the six was employed upon local as opposed to overseas terms, but the differences between the provisions ofhis contract and those of the others are minor and not material to the issues.  The following provision which appeared in the expatriateconditions in the following terms is of particular significance:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>Renewal</u></p>        <p class="quote"> </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The contract may be renewed for a further period commencing April 1 1979 upon terms to be agreed between Society and Player providedthat agreement for renewal has been reached on or before December 31, 1978.

It will be seen that the last paragraph of the latter omits the non-renewal deemingprovision of the former. Upon essentially that basis, the Plaintiffs sought to argue that they were entitled to renewal legally andmorally. Since it is no part of the Plaintiffs' case that they were legally or contractually entitled to renewal, I will say onlythat I was not persuaded as to any such legal right either upon the contra proferentem rule or any trade usage or trade custom inHong Kong, whatever the position in the United States or elsewhere.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Representations by Mr. McKenzie</u></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The next development was the announcement about the end of December 1978 that Mr. Ling TUNG, a Chinese conductor residing in theUnited States, would be the next musical director of the Orchestra.

Its day-to-day management was delegated to an ExecutiveCommittee. There was also an Orchestra Liason Committee. The latter consisted of four representatives of the management and fourplayers from the Orchestra. The latter were known as the Players' Committee, and one of them was Mr. Robert Stewart, the lst Plaintiff.He was also spokesman of the Players' Committee, and the principal oboist in the Orchestra.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Not unnaturally, those players who heard of the rumours that their jobs might be affected were concerned. Mr. Stewart says he gotin touch with Mr. McKenzie, the Chairman of the Committee, and told him of the rumours and that Mr. McKenzie immediately respondedby telling him that neither his nor any of the other players' jobs were in jeopardy, only existing vacancies were to be filled byMr. Ling TUNG. Mr. Stewart was by no means an impressive witness. He was not very precise and many of his answers were relativelylong in coming, but that might have been his manner or his concern for accuracy.  Also he was less than frank about his regrettableconduct at one particular rehearsal. Nonetheless having duly considered these and the other relevant matters, I accept his evidenceon the general nature of Mr. McKenzie's response and find as a fact that Mr. McKenzie represented to Mr. Stewart, although not necessarilyand precisely in those terms, that neither Mr. Stewart's position nor the positions of other players were in jeopardy. In my finding,the representation was intended to reassure Mr. Stewart and the players concerned, and having regard to Mr. Stewart's position asa member of the Players' Committee and indeed their spokesman, was intended not only for Mr. Stewart but also for the players whomhe represented.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Representation by Maria Lui</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The rumours nevertheless persisted.  Mr. Stewart approached Maria Lui, the assistant general manager of the Orchestra. It is notdisputed that she told him that Mr. LING Tung was only authorized to fill existing vacancies. In my finding, the statement that Mr.Ling TUNG was only authorized to fill existing vacancies was accurate. However, in the context in which it was made, it inevitablyprovided Mr. Stewart, and through him, other players concerned with some reassurance about their positions and was no doubt intendedto have that effect. In that regard, Mr. Koljonen, another member of the Orchestra whose evidence I shall examine later, also approachedMaria Lui. I accept his evidence that she said, "Don't worry. ".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Representations by Dr. Solomon Bard</u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> These representations were not pleaded by the Plaintiffs and the omission was sought to be rectified much too late to be permitted.The Plaintiffs cannot, therefore, rely upon the representations and I need concern myself with them no further.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Representations by Mr. Duffus</u></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It is these representations that were particularly disputed and upon which the Plaintiffs particularly rely. It is necessary, therefore,to consider them carefully.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. Duffus arrived in Hong Kong on 3rd March 1978 to take up the position of general manager of the Orchestra. He found things werenot what they should have been in relation to the management of the orchestra and the morale of the players, among other matters.In particular, he decided to improve communication with the players. To that end he addressed the players after a rehearsal on the30th April. In terms of the letter of extension, that was the last day by which new agreements of employment had to be completed.In my finding on all the evidence, there can be no question but that the players were very concerned about whether their agreementswere to be renewed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The six Plaintiffs gave evidence that was by no means entirely consistent as to the representations Mr. Duffus made at the meetingon the 30th April nor about the subsequent questions and answers and the general sequence. It is not necessary to set out in detailwhat each of the six Plaintiffs, all of whom claimed to have been at the meeting, gave as their individual versions of what was said.Notwithstanding a degree of divergence, I find a general and credible consistency. On behalf of the Defendant, it was suggested thatthe Plaintiffs' repeated references to "reassured" (an expression which appears in the Plaintiffs' pleadings), and to Mr. Ling TUNG'sarrival being awaited as "a matter of courtesy" was an indication of the fabricated orchestration of relevant evidence. Having regardto the circumstances, the relevant evidence and the demeanour of the witnesses, I reject that suggestion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In addition to the Plaintiffs, three other players who attended the meeting gave evidence in support of their claim, John Koljonen,Amy Sun and SUI Kin-chin. All three were players whose contracts were not renewed or forthcoming and the former two are Plaintiffsin a pending action against the Defendant similar to the present case. I accept Amy Sun's evidence that the meeting of 30th Aprilwas for the purpose of explaining the delay, that several reasons were given and that she took it that the contracts would be coming.Her evidence was strongly corroborative of the Plaintiffs' case. SUI Kin-chin was rather vague about the meeting and I do not regardhis evidence as adding anything to the Plaintiffs' case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> John Koljonen's evidence needs to be examined with greater care. He remained in court for most of the proceedings after he had givenevidence, and took copious notes. He met the Filippino Plaintiffs upon their arrival in Hong Kong for the trial of this action andescorted them to their accommodation. As I have said, he is a Plaintiff in a pending parallel action against the Defendant. And hewas active during the hearing in briefing the Plaintiffs' solicitors. In support of the Plaintiffs' version of Mr. Duffus' statementsand his claim that he too was reassured, Mr. Koljonen proved conclusively by documentary evidence that he executed an agreement forthe purchase of a flat on 8th May 1979, 8 days after the meeting of 30th April. If Mr. Ling TUNG was regarded by the Plaintiffs asthe emminence gris behind their misfortunes, equally John Koljonen was similarly regarded by the Defendant as orchestrating the actionsagainst it, and efforts were made to discredit him and indeed to restrain him. Having regard to all the circumstances and to theevidence and his demeanour, in general I accept Mr. Koljonen's evidence as evidence of the truth, which nonetheless I have approachedWith caution before accepting upon any issue.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Three witnesses gave evidence for the Defendant, Lynn. Levy, CHUNG Hoi-chuen and John Duffus.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Lynn Levy was recruited by Mr. Ling TUNG as the second oboist. She arrived on 27th March 1979 and had been very shabbly treated byMr. Stewart, the principal oboist. She attended the meeting of the 30th April but was rather vague about it, not surprisingly, asshe already had her contract and had no reason to be concerned. She confirmed that there was great concern on the part of players,which she described as paranoia and anxiety, about renewal of their contracts, and that the meeting was regarding the necessity topostpone the contracts. According to her, Mr. Duffus said more time was needed for technical reasons such as translation and alsothat Mr. Ling TUNG wanted more time to get acquainted with the Orchestra and the players, to evaluate them, meaning hear the playersplaying in the Orchestra, nothing more, and not to audition them. The players, according to her, were anxious before the meetingand remained anxious after it. Miss Levy in my view was a truthful witness; however her recollection of what was said on the 30thwas patently poor. Her reference to technical reasons and translation as causes given for the delay tends to corroborate the Plaintiffs'evidence more than that of Mr. Duffus.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> CHUNG Hoi-chuen was a Chinese member of the Orchestra who also attended the meeting of 30th April. His contract was subsequentlyrenewed but in a demoted capacity. His English, as he explained, was poor. Nevertheless, he paid no attention to the translationpreferring instead to rely upon the explanation sought and obtained, while Mr. Duffus was speaking, from a Chinese player sittingalongside. His testimony went much further than that of Mr. Duffus in claiming that Mr. Duffus stated that he had to wait until Mr.Ling TUNG arrived to make decisions as to who or which musicians were to be retained. I was unfavourably impressed by Mr. CHUNG Hoi-chuen,and regret that I am driven to conclude that his evidence cannot be relied upon because of his marked and amply manifested hostilitytowards the non-Chinese players, particularly Mr. Koljonen. I reject his evidence as to what Mr. Duffus said.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> There was also the affidavit evidence of Miss Virginia Crumb a former player now in the United States. I did not find her versionof what Mr. Duffus said, which was different again, at all helpful.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Duffus says that the delay in production of the contracts was only one of several matters he dealt with. This is how he put hisversion of what he said about renewal of the contracts:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I advised members of the Orchestra that no contracts could be offered until after the musical director's arrival in Hong Kong inthe following month. I said the General Committee wished Mr. Tung to spend more time with the Orchestra before any decision on contractswas made. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Duffus also produced what he claimed to be the actual note he had used at the meeting on the 30th April for the purpose of listingthe points he had intended to make. He discovered it in July 1979 in response to the Defendant's solicitors' request for documentaryevidence when the Plaintiffs first instituted proceedings. Notwithstanding a totally uncharacteristic error in wrongly dating thenote "1/4/79" by almost a month and the absence of any explanation, I accept the note as genuine. It was in the following terms:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">Meeting 1/4/79</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    Contract Renewal</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote">                Delay                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)    Music Director to decide</td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">                (2)    New contract not ready                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">                (3)    New rates of pay to be decided                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">                (4)    Holiday arrangements                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">                (5)    Medical benefits                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="20%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top" class="quote">                (6)    Contract term - 1, 2, 3?                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="77%" class="quote">                (2)    Tuning - 4th warning?                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="77%" class="quote">                (3)    Schedule May - AP1                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="77%" class="quote">                (4)    June - Film Music                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="28%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" class="quote">( Frances Ingles v Carnival 2 hrs.</td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="28%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" class="quote">(</td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="28%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="60%" class="quote">( Schuman</td>            <td width="12%" class="quote">"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> On its face "Music Director to decide" is strong evidence that that is what Mr. Duffus intended to say. But no-one, not even Mr.Duffus himself suggested that was what he said.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Duffus, who, it should be noted, was present in court throughout the Plaintiffs' case, impressed me as a very able, knowledgeableand competent individual. His evidence in chief, relative to that of many of the Plaintiffs' witnesses, was remarkably coherent andalso precise and detailed. However, it was shown in cross-examination that he had been less than frank in suppressing, evidence ofhis dealings with the American Musicians' Federation on the non-renewal of the Plaintiffs' contracts. It was also shown that hisevidence was not as precise or accurate as it first appeared.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> He spent the 8 weeks or so, which preceded the meeting of the 30th April, in attending almost all the Orchestra's concerts and manyrehearsals, and in meeting players. He claimed, however, that he neither received nor detected any evidence of concern by the playersabout renewal of their contracts. That, I find quite remarkable to say the least.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Having regard to all the evidence, I doubt whether the precise words Mr. Duffus used can now be recalled. Nevertheless I accept theevidence of the Plaintiffs and their three witnesses that the players were reassured by Mr. Duffus' words. I accept that there wouldhave been an adverse reaction if the players had been told that Mr. Ling TUNG was to decide which of them were to have their contractsrenewed, indeed a very adverse reaction on the part of Mr. Stewart and Mr. Koljonen who had encountered Mr. Ling TUNG before, andknew him. </p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> What Mr. Duffus says he actually said is far removed from his note and could scarcely be calculated to apprise the players that theDirector was in fact to decide whether their contracts were to be renewed. Nor am I satisfied that he accurately recalls what hesaid. Needless to say, I prefer the Plaintiffs' consistent claim that they were reassured, to Mr. Duffus' diluted version of whathis note suggests was to be said. Regardless of whether that was his original intention, and whatever his motive, whether to softenthe blow, to preserve morale or to gloss over a potential problem, I am satisfied on the probabilities that Mr. Duffus in fact reassuredthe players as the Plaintiffs and their witnesses claim. In my finding, what he represented to the players was that their jobs werenot in jeopardy and that they could expect renewal of their contracts, though not necessarily in those precise words. I should addthat in my view even Mr. Duffus' version of what he said (which I reject on the probabilities) would in the circumstances have beenconstrued by the players as reassurance, and could only have been intended as such. As I have already said Mr. Duffus claimed thathe was not conscious of the players anxiety about renewal of their contracts. I believe that he must have been concerned in the interestsof the Orchestra not to precipitateany sort of exodus of players, and that this and his concern to give players as much notice aspossible (evidenced by the speed with which he got out the letters of non-renewal once the decision was taken) placed him in an invidiousposition. He would not concede this having claimed that he was not aware of the players' anxieties. But when questioned by me, hesaid that if he had been aware of their anxiety he would have had to clarify the position but seemed unable to say how he would dothat.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiffs pleaded a number of specific representations as pressed or implied. In that context, I find as a fact that Mr. Duffusmade statements at the meeting of the 30th April to the following effect though not necessarily in precisely the same terms: -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                that members of the Orchestra should not worry about their new contracts not being available for signing despitethe date,                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                that the new contracts had been held up because of technicalities and the translation into Chinese,               <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(c)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                that the new contracts would be issued shortly and the Committee were waiting for the Musical Director as a matterof courtesy,                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(d)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                that arrangements had been made with Air France about vacation tickets and he wanted to know everyone's travel plans,and                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(e)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">that he hoped everyone was reassured.</td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In reference to the pleadings, I am also satisfied that in the circumstances, the oral representations including those of Mr. McKenzieand Maria Lui meant and were understood to mean by implication if not expressly that</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                the Plaintiffs' ability as players was not in question;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                the Defendant was not seeking replacements for them or any of them;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(c)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">                the new contracts would not be required to be signed by 30th April 1979, but would be available shortly;               <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(d)</td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">that the new contracts would be on the same or better terms.</td>            <td width="17%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In my finding, the representations in the circumstances could only reasonably have been construed as meaning that the Plaintiffs'contracts would be renewed and that they were understood in that sense, notwithstanding that the Plaintiffs were not totally convincedthat the contracts would in fact be renewed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Whether the representations were deceitful or negligent</u></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> It was not suggested that Mr. McKenzie's or Maria Lui's statements were deceitful; nor was there evidence of that. But as seniorofficers or representatives of the Plaintiffs' employer, they had a duty to the Plaintiffs; that was conceded by the Defendant. Havingregard to that duty and the specific nature of the allegations put to them by Mr. Stewart, I think both Mr. McKenzie and Maria Luiwere negligent and reckless in not ascertaining the true position before making the reassuring representations they did, regardlessof any genuine belief they may have had in their truth. It was proved beyond doubt that as early as February 1979, Mr. Ling TUNGwas actively recruiting players in the United States. That he might only have had power to recommend and not to make appointmentsis neither here nor there; likewise that he may have indicated that his approaches were subject to the approval of the Orchestra.The mere fact that he was seeking new players placed the jobs of existing players in jeopardy. And in the result, it was not disputedthat it was his word that lost the Plaintiffs their jobs. The letters to the Plaintiffs notifying the non-renewal of their contractsclearly stated that was being done on the advice of the musical director.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> In passing, I would record that a sustained attack was made upon the professional competence and even character of Mr. Ling TUNGon the tenuous ground that he was so deficient in those respects that it was an abrogation of its management responsibilities bythe Defendant and evidence of its negligence in entrusting him with the functions of musical director, including that of decidingthe renewal or otherwise of the Plaintiffs' contracts, and in assuming that he would and had not immediately set in train actionto replace players, even one he had not heard. I am pleased that in the end I have not had to make a finding on these allegationsor to rely upon them in determining any of the issues. Although that is not always a task that can be avoided, it is not somethingthat any court would relish in the absence of the party against whom the allegations are made and who is therefore not in a positionto defend himself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Proceeding to Mr. Duffus' representation it was submitted on behalf of the Plaintiffs that the representation was deceitful as Mr.Duffus virtually alone of all concerned, knew that the management had unfettered power not to renew players contracts. I do not acceptthat submission nor do I accept its premise that all the plaintiffs believed and believed fully that they had a contractual or legalright of renewal of their contracts.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> There was, of course, other evidence that tended to establish deceit. Mr. Duffus had met Mr. Ling Tung in London in February priorto coming to Hong Kong, and had been told by him of his concern that there were weak players in the Orchestra. Mention was made ofthe principal oboe and also of the poor standard of leadership of a number of principal players. In addition there were respectsin which Mr. Duffus was unfavourably impressed by the Orchestra upon his arrival, including the harshtone of the principal oboe.At the meeting of the Executive Committee on 16th March, which he attended, it was agreed that the decision to renew musicians' newcontracts would be taken in May after Mr. Tung's arrival. All this tends to show that Mr. Duffus should have been alive to what atthe very least was a probability that some if not many contracts would not be renewed. Nevertheless I do not think it actually establishesthe falsity to his knowledge of the reassurance he gave to the players. I would therefore proceed rather upon the alternative groundof negligence. In my finding, Mr. Duffus was at least clearly negligent, having regard to his position and duty to employees as GeneralManager of the Orchestra and above all to his knowledge of the foregoing matters.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> It was not disputed that the representations were made with the intention that they be relied upon, nor in my view could that nothave been so. I will deal with the question of whether they were in fact relied upon in the context of the damages sustained.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> It was submitted by Mr. Maxwell Lewis for the Defendant that the representations made by Mr. McKenzie and Maria Lui were made intheir non-official capacities and were not authorised by the Defendant. I reject both submissions. In my finding it was entirelywithin the scope of authority of Mr. McKenzie and Maria Lui, and indeed of Mr. Duffus, to make the representations and they did soas much in their official as in their personal capacities.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Quantum of Damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The Plaintiffs have all claimed as damages the loss of remuneration they would have received for up to 2 years under the renewedcontracts they expected. It is not disputed that their claims are founded not in contract but in tort, and in my finding the tortis not deceit but negligent misrepresentation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I adopt as the law the following statement at the end of paragraph 1481 of the 14th Edition of McGregor on Damages:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Despite this paucity of authority, however, it is clear that the proper aim of the damages award is to restore the plaintiff, asfar as possible and subject to the usual rules of remoteness and the like, to the position in which he would have been if the negligentmisrepresentation had never been made. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Paragraph 1481 is concerned with negligent misrepresentation. Nevertheless as the learned Editors point out in paragraph 1479, theanalogy of deceit cases can be useful. And in respect of deceit, it is observed at paragraph 1459 that:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The tort of deceit needs careful handling as far as damages are concerned because in the great majority of cases the action inducedby the deceit is the entering into a contract by the plaintiff, either with the defendant tortfeasor or with a third party, and itis important in such circumstances to stress the difference between a measure of damages based on tort principles and a measure ofdamages based on contract principles. Thus the correct measure of damages in the tort of deceit is an award which serves to put theplaintiff into the position he would have been in if the representation had not been made to him, and not, as with breach of conditionor warranty in contract, into the position he would have been in if the representation had been true.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In McConnell v. Wright <em>[</em>1903<em>]</em> / 1 ch. 546 (C.A. ) Collins M.R. said of the action of deceit:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is not an action for breach of contract, and, therefore, no damages in respect of prospective gains which the person contractingwas entitled by his contract to expect come in, but it is an action of tort - it is an action for a wrong done whereby the plaintiffwas tricked out of certain money in his pocket; and therefore, prima facie, the highest limit of his damages is the whole extentof his loss, and that loss is measured by the money which was in his pocket and is now in the pocket of the company. That is theultimate, final, highest standard of his loss. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In passing I observe that this tortious measure of damages for deceit was endorsed in Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) <em>[</em>1969<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20QB%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 QB 158 (C.A.)</a>, although Denning MR held that it should extend also to consequential damage. What he said (at page 167) was</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The object of damages is to compensate the plaintiff for all the loss he has suffered, so far, again, as money can do it. In contract,the damages are limited to what may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties. In fraud, they are notso limited. The defendant is bound to make reparation for all the actual damages directly flowing from the fraudulent inducement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The direct relationship of the damages to the fraud was echoed by Wynn L. J. who said at page 168 "The damage ............ must haveflowed directly from the fraud perpetrated'". Sachs L. J. at page 171 referred to Clark v Urquhart <em>[</em>1930<em>]</em> A.C. 28 saying</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="74%" valign="top" class="quote">                There Lord Atkin said in a concise manner (at p.68) : "I should have thought it" - that is the measure of damages-"wouldbe based on the actual damage directly flowing from the fraudulent inducement.

Thus, the court mustobviously take care not to include sums for consequences which may be due to the plaintiff's own unreasonable actions, and also notto include results which are too remote - matters which often involve difficult questions of fact and degree. But such difficultiesdo not alter the duty of the court, which should approach the matter on a broad basis.

Neither the loss of that remuneration nor indeed the non-renewal of the contracts flowed directlyor was a consequence of the representations. If the misrepresentations had never been made (or even if the Plaintiffs had been fullyand accurately told of the true position) their contracts would none the less have not been renewed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Virtually no attempt was made to establish any actual loss or damage that they sustained and would not have done had the representationsnot been made. Nor, in relation to what the Plaintiffs might have done had the misrepresentations not been made, should it be forgottenthat all of them were contractually bound to serve as players until their extended contractual terms expired on 31st July 1979. Iproceed then to consider the individual circumstances of each of the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>1st Plaintiff</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr. Stewart did not attempt to establish any loss, expenditure or detriment that he would not have incurred had the representationnot been made, nor that he lost any employment that he would otherwise have secured. He did seek to prove that employment prospectswere better early in the year, particularly in the United States and I would accept that. But from his half-hearted attempts to securere-employment following non-renewal of his contract at the end of July and the lack of openings for oboists anyway, in my finding,the probability is that he did not lose any employment opportunity whatsoever i.e. that he would not have secured employment anyway.His failure to obtain employment resulted not from the misrepresentation but from the non-availability of positions for oboists,from his demoralization, and from his decision to go in for free lancing. His demoralisation may have been contributed to or accentuatedby the misrepresentations raising expectations of renewal. But in my view it was primarily the result of loss of employment on non-renewalof his contract. In any event demoralisation would have resulted in loss not of the renewed contract earnings claimed, but of someother future earning the basis of which he did not even attempt to establish. In my finding, his loss of employment and remunerationwas not caused by the misrepresentation. There is accordingly in my view no basis upon which I could properly make any award of damagesto him and his claim must accordingly fail.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>3rd, 4th, 5th and 12th Plaintiffs</u></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=46%20se%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">46.</a> These 4</a> Filippino plaintiffs all went back to the Philippines and after a while in broad terms recovered their former employment. With theexception of a forfeited deposit lost by the 2nd Plaintiff, the evidence does not disclose that any of them sustained any loss, expenditureor detriment by reason of the misrepresentations. There is no suggestion that but for the misrepresentation they would have takenearlier action to find other employment much less obtained such employment earlier. Furthermore, there is no suggestion or evidencethat they would have looked to the United States for employment or that their prospect of obtaining other employment would have beenbetter in the earlier part of the year.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> There was some suggestion by two of these Plaintiffs, Mr. Barcelo and Mr. Ramirez that they incurred additional expenditure or suffereddetriment in that one committed himself to expensive school fees for his daughter and the other got his wife to resign her job. Butin the event it was conceded that the daughter moved to the expensive school before 30th April and likewise that the wife gave noticebefore 30th April and in any event later got her job back. Furthermore the 2nd Plaintiff, Mr. Agtarap sought to make 3 similar claimsin the following respects. First, that he incurred additional educational fees for his son because he was not in a position to paythem in a lump sum and so had to pay at a higher rate. In the event under cross-examination, he was quite happy to admit that hehad sufficient savings to pay the fees in a lump sum anyway, and so could have avoided the additional expenditure if in fact he didincur it. Second, he claimed that as a result of the reassurance of renewal of his contract which he conveyed to his family, hisdaughter resigned her teaching job in Macau. It was not made clear to me what detriment he suffered and in any case I consider suchdetriment, if any, would be too remote. Besides, he was not sure and could not remember when his daughter resigned. Finally, he claimedthat prior to April 1979 he and his wife had contemplated the purchase of some land in the Philippines. When he relayed the reassuranceof renewal of his contract to her, it was decided that she should go ahead with the purchase of the land and she accordingly paida first instalment of 2,000 pesos. Upon non-renewal of his contract, the purchase had to be abandoned and the instalment was lost.Mr. Agtarap frankly conceded that the deposit was paid in June 1979. Mr. Agtarap's recollection of some of the distant events towhich he had to testify, was a little vague and he did not seek to conceal this. His English was somewhat poor and occasionally accountedfor some misunderstanding of the questions put to him. But in general I found him an honest and candid witness. I accept his evidenceof the loss of the 2,000 pesos, upon which he was not shaken. In my judgment, his claim in respect of this amount must succeed.</p>    <p><u>15th Plaintiff</u></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Finally I come to the 15th Plaintiff, Mr. YEUNG Siu-muk. He was the only local musician of all the Plaintiffs, and clearly sustainedthe most severe blow from non-renewal, both in terms of financial loss and mental distress. He has not been able to find alternativeemployment and even his private music teaching opportunities have diminished possibly because of the non-renewal of his contract.However much as it is to be regretted that the non-renewal of his contract could not have been accomplished in a manner that occasionedless distress to him, it cannot be gainsaid that his loss and distress flowed not from the misrepresentations made to him, but fromthe non-renewal of his contract. Had the misrepresentation not been made or even if he had been told on the 30th April that his contractwould not be renewed, it is difficult to see what he could have done to avoid the hardships he subsequently had to endure. Thereapparently are simply no jobs for professional cellists in Hong Kong. His claim, too, must therefore fail.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> I should add that the Plaintiffs sought to claim aggravated damages on the basis of the long-lasting disadvantage they would as musicianssuffer from their non-renewal letters which would be regarded as dismissals; from the long-lasting disadvantage of trying to finda job geographically far away from the repercussions of the loss of the Hong Kong jobs, and from missing out on the best time forapplying for new orchestral positions at the beginning of the year.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> However from the judgment of the House of Lords in Cassell v Broome <em>[</em>1972<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 All ER 801</a> and para 5-36 of the 15th Edition of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts it seems to me that aggravated damages, as their name suggests aremerely a higher award of existing damages. They are sought here upon the ground of enhanced difficulty of finding re-employment.But this ground has not been shown to have anything to do with the misrepresentions. Nor do I accept the suggestion made on behalfof the Plaintiffs, that if the misrepresentations had not been made, they would have left and not been subject to the non-renewalletters with their damaging implication of dismissal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> For the foregoing reasons the claims of all the Plaintiffs must fail, save that of the 2nd Plaintiff to the instalment of 2,000 pesosthat was lost.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I will now hear counsel upon interest on that sum and on costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(G.P.
