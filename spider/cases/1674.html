that certain paragraphs in the Statement of Claimand Answers to the Request for Further and Better Particulars be struck out.

Before me, counsel for the Appellant had made it clearthat the Plaintiff would not challenge certain parts of the Order and the parts being struck out which were subject to the appealwere: paragraphs 12(a), (b), (e), (f) &amp; (g), 13 and 14 and its particulars (a) to (h), Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal (a),(b) &amp; (e), particulars (d), (h) &amp; (o) of paragraph 15, paragraphs 16, 17 &amp; 18 of the Statement of Claim and the AnswersNos. 2, 8 &amp; 14 of the Answers to the Request for Further and Better Particulars.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> This action arose out of an employment contract between the Plaintiff as the employee and the Defendant as the employer. By paragraph2 of the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff pleaded that there was an employment agreement in writing dated 22 July 1997. By thatagreement, the Plaintiff was employed as Business Manager - (CAT and EAP) and was assigned to work location in the Defendant's branchoffice in Shanghai for a term of two years commencing from August 1997. The Plaintiff further pleaded that the contract of employmentwas renewed in August 1999 by another written employment agreement dated 8 August 1999 for another term of 3 years commencing from11 August 1999. It was further pleaded that this contract of employment of August 1999 was contained in or evidenced by or to beinferred from (a) an employment letter dated 8 August 1999 enclosing a 2-pages accompanying document headed "Terms and Conditions"(the "Employment Letter"); and (b) a booklet entitled "Going Global with BOC - your guide to international assignments" issued bythe Defendant to its expatriate employees (the "Guide"). It is further pleaded that by the express terms found in the EmploymentLetter and the Guide, provisions were expressly made in relation to (a) remuneration; (b) housing allowance; (c) use of company car;(d) medical benefit and personal accident and injury benefit; (e) education of children benefit; and (f) annual leave benefit. Inparagraph 8 of the Statement of Claim it is pleaded as an express term of the employment agreement that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the agreement shall only be terminated under the following circumstances <em>but not otherwise</em> [emphasis added]</p>        <p class="quote">a) By the Defendant giving the Plaintiff six months' notice in writing or the Plaintiff at any time;</p>        <p class="quote">b) By the Defendant at any time and summarily without notice in lieu if the Plaintiff commits any serious breach of the regulationscontained in the Employment Letter or indulges in conduct detrimental to the Defendant's interest;</p>        <p class="quote">c) By the Defendant at any time upon six calendar months' notice in writing to the Plaintiff if there exists circumstances renderingimpossible for the employment to continue in the work location;</p>        <p class="quote">d) In the circumstances of contract expiring by the Defendant giving six months' notice in writing before expiring date; and if nowritten notice was given to the Plaintiff six months before the expiring date, the Agreement is automatically renewed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim it is pleaded there was an express term that in the event of early termination the Defendantshould reimburse unavoidable expenses incurred in consequence of termination and costs of other commitments in anticipation of continuedemployment. In paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim it is pleaded that in the event of termination by the Defendant under any circumstances,it was expressly provided in the Agreement that the Plaintiff would be entitled to the benefit of severance pay, repatriation tothe USA, disturbance allowance and the benefit of certain partner support budget. The Master had struck out the pleading relatingto the partner support budget and there was no appeal on this point.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Then there came the controversial parts of the pleading which are in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">"12.</td>                <td width="85%" class="quote">Further, in order to give business efficacy to the Agreement and/or arising from the mutual intentions of the parties thereto and/orby reason of the previous course of dealings between the Plaintiff and the Defendant since July 1997, the following terms were impliedinto the Agreement:</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a) The Plaintiff was entitled to the 6 months' notice of intention to terminate the employment and to have the employment continueduntil the expiration of such notice;</p>            <p class="quote">b) The Plaintiff was entitled to be provided with all benefits referred to under the Agreement until expiry of his employment or untilthe end of the 6 months' notice period in case of early termination;</p>            <p class="quote">e) In any event, the Plaintiff was entitled to performance appraisal for each and every financial year in accordance with his performancefrom the Defendant failing which the Plaintiff was entitled to claim compensation arising therefrom;</p>            <p class="quote">f) The Defendant would maintain and not, without reasonable and proper cause, so conduct itself as to destroy or seriously damagethe relationship of trust and confidence between itself and the Plaintiff;</p>            <p class="quote">g) The Defendant would not, without reasonable cause, do anything which would injure the Plaintiff's physical or mental health orharm his professional development.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">13.</td>                <td width="85%" class="quote">Further or in the alternative, the Plaintiff avers that the Defendant as an employer owed him a duty of care not to cause injury tohis health because the Defendant ought reasonably to have foreseen that such injury to the Plaintiff was likely to result from theunfair manner of dismissal by the Defendant.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" class="quote">14.</td>                <td class="quote">By a letter dated 16 January, 2001, the Defendant, with a view to eliminate the Plaintiff for reasons totally unrelated to the Plaintiff,wrongfully and in repudiatory breach of the Agreement, dismissed the Plaintiff from employment with effect from the end of February,2001.

It appeared that this figure was an estimation based on the fact that there was noacknowledgment of the Plaintiff's achievement in the previous year and no salary increase was given to the Plaintiff which wouldnormally follow an appraisal.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It cannot be in dispute in this case that the express term pleaded in paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim was intended to be aplea of the term set out in paragraph 9 of the Employment Letter dated 8 August 1999. It is however important to note that whileparagraphs 8(a) to (d) of the Statement of Claim correctly summarized the effect of paragraphs 9(a) to (d) of the letter, the expressterm set out in the letter did not contain the words "but not otherwise" which were added in by the pleader in paragraph 8 of theStatement of Claim. Those words were of crucial importance to this appeal. While it is clearly the contention of the Plaintiff thatthe effect of paragraph 9 of the Employment Letter was as pleaded, those words were in fact not there. Of course, it was the Defendant'scontention that the 4 methods set out in paragraphs 8(a) to (d) were not the only methods for the termination of the contract ofemployment.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It is again not in dispute that the Defendant did send a letter dated 16 January 2001 terminating the Plaintiff's employment. Therelevant part of the letter was in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Further to our discussions, I confirm that your contract with BOC China will come to an early conclusion and the requisite 6-monthnotice period will be effective as of today 16 January 2001.</p>        <p class="quote">As discussed, we will target end-February as an agreed time for your departure from BOC. We will then fulfill our obligation by payingout the remaining period of notice that you would not be serving. The other terms relating to early conclusion of the contract willalso apply."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> There is again no dispute that since the letter of 16 January 2001, the Defendant paid the Plaintiff the following sum:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) full salary payment between 16 January 2001 to 28 February 2001;</p>        <p>(b) half of the total amount of salary from 1 March 2001 to 15 July 2001;</p>        <p>(c) half of the severance pay'</p>        <p>(d) full amount of the outstanding leave of 30 days; and</p>        <p>(e) full amount of the variable payment for the year of 2000.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In relation to the salary between 1 March 2001 to 15 July 2001 and also the severance pay, the retention of half of the amount wasfor the purpose of tax provision in accordance with the PRC law. There is really no dispute that after deduction of the tax liabilitythe balance would be paid over to the Plaintiff. There is also no dispute that the Plaintiff, his wife and child would be given businessclass tickets for repatriation to the USA and the Plaintiff would be given US$3,000.00 for accommodation in the USA upon repatriation.In relation to the company car and driver, the Defendant had provided them for the Plaintiff's use until 31 March 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The principles applicable to the striking out pleadings or parts of a pleadings are well known. It is only in plain and obvious casesthat the Court should exercise its power to summarily strike out the pleadings. The Court should not be engaged in any trial on affidavits.Normally the Court would assume that the facts asserted in the pleadings sought to be struck out are true. It is only when the Courtis satisfied that there is no basis for the pleas and that the pleas sought to be struck out are unarguable and incontestably badthat the Court would strike out the pleas. While the Court would normally decline to strike out where the striking out would involvethe Court's resolving a difficult or complex point of law, if upon hearing arguments, the Court can come to a clear view that itis plain and obvious that the plea is not maintainable the Court should not decline to strike out simply because there is a pointof law involved.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In relation to the application to strike out paragraphs 12(a) &amp; (b) of the Statement of Claim, the Defendant contended that therecould not be any implied term in the contract of employment as alleged in these 2 subparagraphs. The Plaintiff of course contendedotherwise. On the part of the Plaintiff, it was contended that paragraph 9 of the Employment Letter plainly showed that with theexception of cases falling under paragraphs 9(b)(i) &amp; (ii), the Company must give 6 months' notice to terminate the agreement.In the case falling within sub-paragraph (a), the termination by giving 6 months' notice may be effected without any reason. In thecase falling within sub-paragraphs (c) &amp; (d), then even though the relevant circumstances should exist there must still be a6 months' notice in order to determine the employment. Thus, the Plaintiff's counsel argued that it is at least arguable that asa matter of business efficacy or as a matter of mutual intention or by reason of the previous course of dealings, there ought tobe implied the terms set out in paragraphs 12(a) &amp; (b) of the Statement of Claim, which in effect meant that in all circumstancesexcept those set out in sub-paragraph 9(b) of the Employment Letter, the Plaintiff must be entitled to 6 months' notice and thatthe employment could not be terminated before the actual expiration of the 6 months' notice period.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I am of the view that plainly the implied terms pleaded in paragraphs 12(a) &amp; (b) of the Statement of Claim could not have arisenby reason of previous course of dealing between the parties. In relation to the right to determine a contract of employment, apartfrom the contractual provisions, there are also statutory provisions giving power to both the employer and the employee to determinean employment contract.

The issue here is whether under this situation there is any further room for saying that there was nevertheless animplied term that the only way of terminating the employment was to continue to employ the Plaintiff until 15 July 2001, the dateof expiration of the 6 months' period of the notice given on 16 January 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> To this issue the Plaintiff's contention was that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 70</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> merely made null terms which purported to extinguish or reduce the right, benefit or protection conferred upon the employee underthe Ordinance, and hence it would not be against <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 70</a> to have a contractual term to the effect that the right to make payment of wages in lieu of notice under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the Ordinance was not to be available to the Defendant, the employer. However, the difficulty of the Plaintiff is a more fundamentalone. It is plain that the terms pleaded in paragraphs 12(a) and (b) of the Statement of Claim are not express terms. The Plaintiff'scontention in effect was that there should be terms implied in the agreement which abrogated the Defendant's rights under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>. It is trite law that terms could not be implied into a contract simply because they are reasonable and no terms could be impliedif it is against an express term of the contract. In the present case, although the power to terminate under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> is not an express term of the employment contract, yet the rights given are nevertheless rights which the Defendant would be entitledto enjoy unless they are taken away by the terms of the agreement. It is difficult to see why as a matter of business efficacy, theremust be a term to exclude the Defendant's statutory rights under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a>, nor could I see any reason for saying that as a matter of unexpressed common intention, there must be a term that the Defendantis not to exercise the rights given to it as employer under the 2 sections. In fact, given the nature of a contract of employmentbeing a contract for personal services, it would be quite unreasonable to force the Defendant to accept the services of an employeeagainst its will. Hence, I come to the conclusion that the Master was right in his conclusion that there could not be an impliedterm as pleaded in paragraphs 12(a) &amp; (b) of the Statement of Claim and the same should thus be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In view of my conclusion that there could not be any implied term in the employment contract to exclude the statutory power to terminatethe employment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, it follows that the Defendant could not be in breach of contract by serving the letter of 16 January 2001. This would be so eventhough it was in effect alleged in sub-paragraphs (a) to (h) of paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim that the dismissal was foran ulterior motive. In <strong>Chapman v Honig</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%202%20QB%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 2 QB 502</a> the Court of Appeal held that a notice to quit served by a landlord on his tenant could not be invalidated by the fact that the landlord'smotive in serving the notice was to punish and victimise the tenant for giving evidence against the landlord in a previous action.Thus as between the same parties, the exercise of a power under the Ordinance to terminate a contract of employment without causecannot be invalidated by some alleged ulterior ill motive on the part of person exercising the statutory power.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In <strong>Reda &amp; Another v Flag Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20IRLR%20747" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] IRLR 747</a>, the contract of employment provided that the employer was entitled to terminate the employment at any time during the contract period(a) for cause (i.e. misconduct); (b) for unsatisfactory performance; and (c) without cause. However, the contract further providedthat the consequence for each type of termination was different. In the case of termination with cause, the employee was merely entitledto be paid his salary up to the date of termination. In the case of termination for unsatisfactory performance, the employee wouldbe entitled to be paid his salary for a further 3-months period (or, if less, for the balance of the contractual term) and also atthe discretion of a compensation committee, a proportion of his annual incentive bonus and completion bonus. In the case of terminationwithout cause, the employee would be paid his salary for another 12 months or if less, until the expiry of the contractual term,and again at the discretion of the compensation committee, a proportion of his incentive and completion bonus. While notice mustbe given for unsatisfactory performance, the contract made no express provision for dismissal without cause. The employer dismissedthe employee without cause. The employee sought to argue that the employer was in breach of the contract because the dismissal wasfor a collateral purpose of avoiding to grant him the benefit of a stock option which the employer would introduce shortly afterthe dismissal. The Privy Council agreed with the view of the Court of Appeal that the very nature of such a power to dismiss withoutcause was that its exercise would not have to be justified, and that was the end of the matter. In any case, the Privy Council furthertook the view that even though the exercise might well be prompted by a desire to avoid granting the benefit of the stock optionto the employee, this could not be properly said to be for a collateral purpose because the directors of the employer did not owethe employee any such fiduciary duties. In my view, the same principle must also apply to the case of the power to terminate thecontract of employment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>. It is plain that under the Ordinance, neither party exercising such right is required to give any reason for terminating the agreement.Thus, the fact that the Defendant might be prompted to exercise such right by matters set out in the Particulars (a) to (h) of paragraph14 could not vitiate the exercise of such power to make it a breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Accordingly, I am also of the view that particulars (a) to (h) of Paragraph 14 should also be struck out. It will also follow frommy conclusion on the rights of the Defendant under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) under the Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal should also be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Also since the claim for the loss of use of the company car in paragraph 15(h) as explained in Answer No. 8 of the Request for Furtherand Better Particulars is predicated on the basis that the Plaintiff was entitled to continue working for the Defendant between 1April 2001 to 15 July 2001, and further this sort of monitory compensation is not part of the wages payable to the employee if theemployer is exercising its right to terminate the employment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, I am of the view that the Master was also right in striking out paragraph 15(h) and Answer No. 8.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Plaintiff however claimed that at least it was arguable that (1) there was an implied term that the Defendant as employer wouldmaintain and not, without reasonable and proper causes, so conduct itself as to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trustand conduct between itself and the Plaintiff (of paragraph 12(f) of the Statement of Claim); and (2) the conduct of the Defendantcomplained of in sub-paragraphs (a) to (h) of the Particulars in paragraph 14 and sub-paragraphs (a) &amp; (b) of the Particularsof Wrongful Dismissal were instances of breach of this implied term.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> I am prepared to accept that in a contract of employment, there would be an implied term of mutual trust and confidence between theemployer and employee. To this extent, in fact, the Defendant did not take issue with the Plaintiff. However, the question is whetherin the circumstances of this particular case and in the context of the termination of employment, the implied term would give riseto an obligation that the employer should not exercise its right under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> to terminate the employment contract without cause and without 6 months' notice by making the payment of wages as stipulated in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In <strong>Bachicha v Poon Shiu Man Henry</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKC%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKC 452</a>, the appellant employer served a one month notice on his domestic helper employee to terminate her contract. Before the notice expired,the wife of the employer who had often ill treated the employee during the course of her employment, used violence to force the employeeto acknowledge and to agree to the notice to terminate her employment. The employee became so afraid that she moved out to a shelterfor domestic helpers. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge that there was a constructive dismissal in the circumstances andalso found that the conduct of ill treatment and the use of violence would also amount to a breach of the mutual obligation of trustand confidence implied in the employment contract for which the Court would award damages. In the course of his judgment RibeiroJA considered the decision of the House of Lords in <strong>Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 20</a> and said that (at page 467 F):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Malik decision emphasizes that where the breach does not relate merely to unlawfulness in the termination but involves a breachof some other obligation causing the employees loss going beyond the 'premature termination losses' that usually flow from a wrongfuldismissal, damages may properly be recovered in respect of such different or further losses, provided they are causally attributableto the breach and not too remote".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Ribeiro JA further held that (at page 468E):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" a given set of facts may constitute both kinds of breaches giving rise simultaneously to separate entitlements to damages, eachindependently computed, but subject obviously to the avoidance of any double recovery.

However,it is important to bear in mind that the <strong>Balchicha</strong> case is a case of constructive dismissal and it was not a case where the employer had exercised any right to terminate under the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The question of the relationship between the implied term of mutual trust and confidence and the right to terminate the contractwas considered again in <strong>Vincent v South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20HKC%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 HKC 353.</a> There the employment contract provided that the employer could terminate the service of the plaintiff employee by giving one monthnotice or payment in lieu of notice. The employer gave one month notice to terminate the employee's employment. The notice wouldexpire 3 weeks before the 5th anniversary of the commencement of the employment with the employer upon which the employee would bequalified for long service payment. The plaintiff employee claimed, inter alia that his dismissal was wrongful and unreasonable andby reason of it he had been deprived of long service payment to which he would otherwise have been entitled under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57#p6a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VIA</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, and he also claimed that in so dismissing him, the employer was in breach of the duty of trust and confidence because the employerhad failed to adopt the normal or a fair process of disciplinary action. Deputy Judge Muttrie held that in the circumstances of thatparticular case although the employee was guilty of some disobedience, a more reasonable course would have been to give the employeea warning and that dismissal was not a reasonable response open to a reasonable employer in the circumstances. Accordingly the employerhad failed to show a valid reason for dismissal of the plaintiff and the plaintiff was entitled to be compensated as though he hadbeen dismissed on due notice after his 5th anniversary of commencement of employment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57#p6a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VIA</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>. However, the plaintiff employee's claim for damages for breach of trust and confidence was dismissed because under the contractthe employer was entitled to dismiss the employee by giving one month notice and to imply any other requirement before this contractualright could be exercised is against the express term of the contract. On this point, Deputy Judge Muttrie said (at page 373 C-I):</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">"63.</td>                <td width="85%" class="quote">The circumstances of this case are obviously far different from those in <em>Malik</em> or <em>Bachicha</em>.

See the judgmentof Lord Steyn in <em>Malikat</em> p 45. But in any event an implied term must not contradict an express term of the contract. Here in the contract we have an expressterm allowing either party to terminate on one month's notice. They can do it on a whim, if they wish. But if the mutual obligationis taken as requiring consultation and warning before dismissal, that contradicts the express term; if takes away the defendant'sright to terminate the contract and by the same token, because the obligation is mutual it would no doubt take away the plaintiff'sright to terminate the contract, for instance if he saw a better job somewhere else, without some form of consultation with the defendantfirst. That cannot be right. In any event it would get the plaintiff nowhere. If he had been consulted and warned, and had kept hisjob, the defendant would still have been under no contractual duty to keep him on, and could still have dismissed him on notice inany event."</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In <strong>Reda v Flag Ltd</strong> supra, the employee also raised the breach of duty of trust and confidence in support of his claim for wrongful dismissal by seekingto argue that the employer's decision to terminate the contract was for the ill motive of avoiding having to grant the employee thebenefit of the stock option. It was further argued that the employer was bound to preserve the relationship for trust and confidencewhich ought to subsist between an employer and his employees and not to destroy that relationship by discriminating arbitrarily betweenits employees by granting some of them valuable financial entitlements and dismissing others in order to avoid having to do so. ThePrivy Council, agreeing with the Court of Appeal, rejected the employee's argument. Lord Millett giving the opinion of the Councilagreed that the contract of employment would contain an implied term that the employer would not without reasonable and proper causedestroy the relationship of trust and confidence which should exist between employer and employee but at the same time made it plainthat in common with other implied term, it must yield to the express provisions of the contract. He referred to his own observationin <strong>Johnson v Unisys</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 All ER 801</a> at 825j that this implied obligation could not sensibly be used to extend the employment relationship beyond its agreed duration,and would further hold that it could not sensibly be used to circumscribe an express power of dismissal without cause.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The present case of course differed from the case of <strong>Reda v Flag Limited</strong> and also <strong>Vincent v South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd</strong> in that the right of the employers in both <strong>Reda</strong>'s case and <strong>Vincent</strong>'s case to terminate without cause was conferred by an express term of the contract of employment, whilst in the present case theright to terminate without cause by giving notice or making payment of wages in lieu of notice was conferred by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>. It was sought to argue that in the case where the right to terminate without cause was given by an express term of the contract,because of the operation of the doctrine that no term could be implied which could work contrarily to an express term, there wasjustification for holding that the duty of mutual trust and confidence which was only an implied term of the contract, could notoperate to cut down the right to terminate without cause given by the express term. It was then argued that the situation may atleast be arguably different when the right to terminate without cause was not given by express term but by statute. I am of the viewthat at least in the context of the present case, there could be no sensible difference between the case where the right to dismisswithout cause was given by an express term of contract and where it is given by statute. In the latter case, one has to ask the questionas to what would be the basis for implying a term of mutual trust and confidence which would work to cut down the statutory right.In such situation, as least in the circumstances of the present case, I do not see on what basis there could be an implied term whichwould cut down the clear right given by the statute. I do not consider that either the requirement of business efficacy or the doctrineof common intention would require that there should be a term implied so as to cut down or modify this clear statutory right.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> It is now convenient to deal with the plea in paragraph 12(f) of the Statement of Claim which in effect is a plea of the impliedterm of trust and confidence. There is no dispute between the parties that such term could be implied into the contact. However,it is to be noted that the only breach of that term alleged in the Statement of Claim was in relation to the termination of contract.It was not alleged that there was any breach of that implied term during the course of employment, thus giving rise to a claim ofdamages independent from the alleged loss suffered as a result of the Defendant's terminating the Plaintiff's employment at the endof February 2001. In this respect I note that in paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim, it was only alleged that the act which constitutedthe breach of the implied term of the duty of trust and confidence and also the term of not injuring the Plaintiff's mental healthand professional development was the "wrongful dismissal". In view of my conclusion on the scope of the operation of the duty ofmutual trust and confidence, I am of the view that this claim is bound to fail. Accordingly I am of the view that paragraph 12(f)should also be struck out as the plea of this implied term was redundant in the circumstances of the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is also convenient now to deal with the Plaintiff's plea of wrongful dismissal in paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim. Underthe heading of Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal, the Plaintiff had given 5 particulars. Particulars (a) &amp; (b) related to thefailure to give 6 months' notice. I have no difficulty in concluding that but for the statutory provision in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, these 2 could be proper particulars of wrongful dismissal. However, if one examines Particulars (c) to (e), it is difficult to seehow the same could be Particulars of wrongful dismissal at all. Particular (c) related to the refusal or failure to pay variablecompensation or bonus for the year 2000/2001. While the failure to make payment properly due to the Plaintiff under the contractwould amount to a breach of the contract of employment, it is difficult to see how this allegation, even if proved, could renderthe dismissal wrongful in the present case. Likewise, the plea in Particular (d) of the Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal relatedto the failure to fully compensate the Plaintiff of all the benefits he would have received pursuant to the terms of the employmentcontract but for the wrongful termination at the time when the contract was effectively terminated. The particulars given under paragraph15 on the loss and damages would indicate that the Plaintiff's real contention was that the Plaintiff would contend that the Plaintiffought to be put in the same position as if he had continued to work for the Defendant until 15 July 2001, the expiration of the 6months from the date of the notice. Again this Particular (d) of Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal would amount to nothing more thana plea that the Defendant had failed to compensate the Plaintiff so as to put the Plaintiff into the same position as if the Plaintiffwould stay on with the Defendant till 15 July 2001. Properly understood this could not be a description or a particular to supportthe Plaintiff's allegation that the dismissal was wrongful. Particular (e) was plainly a separate allegation of breach of an allegedterm of the contract which would give rise to a separate claim for damages. It was quite independent from whether the contract wasrightfully or wrongfully terminated. Thus properly understood, the Plaintiff's case as pleaded was merely that insofar it was allegedthat dismissal was wrongful, the only ground which could be properly relied on by the Plaintiff was the failure to give the Plaintiff6 months' notice and requiring the Plaintiff to terminate his service before the expiration of 6 months from the day of the 16 January2001 letter notifying him of the termination of his employment.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I now come to the plea in paragraph 12(g) of the Statement of Claim. In this sub-paragraph the Plaintiff pleaded that there was animplied term that the Defendant would not, without reasonable cause, do anything which would injure the Plaintiff's physical or mentalhealth or harm his professional development. I agree that at least it is arguable that this term could be implied in a contract ofemployment. However, the only act of breach of this implied term as pleaded in paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim was the allegedwrongful dismissal itself. Since the only alleged act of wrongful dismissal was in effect the employer's exercising its right toterminate under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, I do not think this implied term could have any scope of operation to cut down the employer's statutory right. Accordingly I amof the view that paragraph 12(g) and paragraph 16 do not give rise to any reasonable cause of action and should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Paragraph 17 purported to plead a cause of action in negligence against the Defendant. The essence of the plea is that the Defendantwas negligent in dismissing the Plaintiff without giving the Plaintiff 6 months' notice or without sufficient reason and full compensationfor the Plaintiff's dismissal. Insofar as it is alleged that the Defendant had failed to make sufficient payment to meet the requirementfor the exercise of the statutory right to dismiss under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, plainly there is a cause of action to recover any short payment. However, I fail to see how this could give rise to any separatetortious duty. Further, insofar as it is alleged the act of negligence was constituted by the exercise of the statutory right toterminate without notice by making payment in lieu, I do not see how the Plaintiff could succeed in an action in tort either (see<strong>Johnson v Unisys Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 All ER 801</a> at 821b para 59).</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I will now come to the plea in paragraph 12(e), sub-paragraph (e) of the Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal under paragraph 14, paragraph15(o) and Answer No. 14 of the Request for Further and Better Particulars. Whether these pleas are maintainable would depend on whetherthere is an arguable case to say that there was an implied term that the Plaintiff was entitled to performance appraisal for eachand every financial year from the Defendant, failing which the Plaintiff was entitled to claim compensation arising from the lackof performance appraisal, and whether there was any breach of such implied term. Implicit in the Plaintiff's contention was not onlythat the Defendant was bound to make and give a performance appraisal to the Plaintiff, but also that the Defendant was bound toraise the salary of the Plaintiff or to give some additional benefit to the Plaintiff upon a favourable appraisal of the Plaintiff'sperformance.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiff prayed in aid of paragraph 5 of the Terms and Conditions annexed to the Employment Letter which said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5. Variable Compensation</p>        <p class="quote">You will have the opportunity of earning sixty thousand US dollars as an incentive for the achievement of pre-defined targets forthe capture of N2 and O2 contracts.</p>        <p class="quote">These targets will be established at the start of each financial year which commences on 1st October.</p>        <p class="quote">Awards will normally be communicated in December and paid in the following January.</p>        <p class="quote">Performance in excess of these targets will generate additional incentive payments. Correspondingly, failure to achieve these targetsmay lead to less payment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> It is to be noted that under paragraph 15(l) of the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff had claimed the shortfalls of variable compensationand/or bonus from 1998 to 2001. In fact, the claim for the year 2000/2001 was made on the basis of not only what the Plaintiff hadachieved up to the time when he left the Defendant's employ on 28 February 2001 but would also include a further amount reflectingwhat the Plaintiff would have achieved if he were to be allowed to work until 15 July 2001. Thus, these items of claims would appearto be distinct and separate from the claim based on the implied term that the Defendant must give a performance appraisal of thePlaintiff's work every financial year. There was no application to strike out the claims under sub-paragraph (c) of the Particularsof Wrongful Dismissal and paragraph 15(l) of the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In paragraph 12 of the Statement of Claim, the implied term on the obligation to give an appraisal of the Plaintiff's performancewas said to have arisen from business efficacy or from the mutual intentions or by reason of previous dealings. I cannot see howsuch obligation could arise from business efficacy or from mutual intentions. Of course such implied obligation may arise from previouscourse of dealings, although in the present case, the Plaintiff had not given any particulars of the previous course of dealingswhich he would rely on to support this plea. Again the implicit suggestion that upon a good appraisal the Plaintiff was entitledto be given some financial benefit or an increase of salary could in a suitable case, also be supported by a course of previous dealingsalthough I doubt whether at the end of the day the Plaintiff could adduce sufficiently cogent evidence to justify the Court to findthat there was such a term implied from the previous course of dealings that the Defendant must appraise the Plaintiff's performanceevery year and must, on top of what was provided for by paragraph 5 of the Terms and Conditions, give the Plaintiff some additionalbenefit or an increase in salary. However, I am not persuaded at this stage that the Plaintiff's contention is completely unarguable.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> However, the mere existence of an implied term in a contract would not be sufficient to support a cause of action. It is still necessaryfor the Plaintiff to plead how the term was breached and also the damages arising from the breach. In the present case, the act ofbreach was "the Defendant failed and refused to give the Plaintiff a performance appraisal for the year 2000/2001 he would have receivedbut for the <em>wrongful termination</em>" and the Defendant's failing to "make any compensation for failing to give such appraisal" (of sub-paragraph (e) of Particulars ofWrongful Dismissal in paragraph No. 14. Thus implicit in such allegation of breach was the suggestion that had the contract not been"wrongfully terminated" then there would come the time when the Defendant would have to give a performance appraisal for the year2000/2001, and that would then trigger off an obligation to give the Plaintiff the benefit or increase in salary.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Since I am of the view that in the present case the Defendant had a right to terminate the contract on 28 February 2001 by givingnotice and making payment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, I am of the view that there could not be an implied term that the Defendant would have to compensate the Plaintiff for the lossof the opportunity to get some benefit arising from there being no performance appraisal because the contract was terminated beforethe same was due. Accordingly I am of the view that these paragraphs relating to the performance appraisal do not give rise to aviable cause of action and should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> I now come to paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim. This paragraph pleaded that by reason of the breach of Agreement and/or negligenceand/or breach of duty of care, the Plaintiff suffered vexation, frustration and mental distress and thereby incurred financial lossand suffered damages. I have already found that the claim on negligence and breach of duty of care should be struck out. However,even though in effect the whole claim for breach of contract by wrongful dismissal, and breach of implied term relating to trustand confidence had been struck out, there are still remaining claims for breach of contract in relation to the children educationsupport, disturbance allowance and also shortfall of variable compensation and/or bonus (of paragraph 15(i), (k) &amp; (l) of theStatement of Claim). Whether these breaches of contract could give rise to a further claim of general damages for vexation, frustrationand mental stress would depend on the remoteness of such general damages. Although in the normal circumstances, such general damageswould not be awarded in a breach of contract in failing to pay because the same is too remote, I cannot say that such general damageswould never be recoverable. Unlike the claim for injury to mental health under paragraph 16, the claim under this paragraph was notpegged with the wrongful dismissal of the Plaintiff. In the circumstances, although the chances for the Plaintiff to succeed in obtainingsuch damages would be slim, I do not think that the claim is so hopeless that should warrant the striking out of the whole of paragraph18.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> On top of the individual sub-paragraphs under Particulars and Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal, the Master also ordered that paragraphNo. 14 to be struck out. It is to be noted that in the Defendant's summons, the Defendant only sought to strike out certain wordsin the first 7 lines of this paragraph so that the paragraph should read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"14. By a letter dated 16 January 2001, the Defendant wrongfully and in repudiatory breach of the Agreement, dismissed the Plaintifffrom employment with effect from the end of February 2001".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It may well be that in ordering to strike out paragraph No. 14, the Master only intended to strike out those parts which the Defendanthad applied to have them struck out. For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to paragraph No. 14, I would order that save for thewords set out above in this paragraph and sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) under Particulars of Wrongful Dismissal, the whole of that paragraphNo. 14 of the Statement of Claim be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Finally I come to paragraph 15(d) of the Statement of Claim and Answer No. 2 of the Request for Further and Better Particulars concerningthe claim for 42 days annual leave benefit. Neither party had addressed me on these paragraphs. The Master had struck out both paragraph15(c) - claim for annual leave pay for 42 days, and 15(d) - claim for annual leave benefit apparently also in relation to the same42 days of annual leave. Counsel for the Plaintiff informed me when opening this appeal that the Plaintiff decided not to challengethe Master's decision in striking out paragraph 15(c) but the Master's decision to strike out paragraph 15(d) would still be subjectto appeal. I was not told of the reason for the Plaintiff's decision. Apparently the Defendant was willing to pay 30 days annualleave pay to the Plaintiff. There was thus a dispute between the parties as to whether the number of leave days should be 30 or 42and also there was a dispute as to whether the Plaintiff was entitled to the leave benefit calculated in the manner as alleged inAnswer No. 2 of the Request for Further and Better Particulars. Counsel for the Defendant had never addressed me on why the Plaintiff'sclaim under paragraph 15(d) was not maintainable. In all fairness, counsel for the Plaintiff had not addressed me on this paragrapheither. In the end, I do not think that I could adjudicate on the dispute on this issue. Although this is an appeal by the Plaintiffagainst the Master's decision to, inter alia strike out paragraph 15(d), bearing in mind that the nature of this appeal is a hearingde noval, I am of the view that the proper course is to allow the appeal in relation to this claim.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Thus to conclude, I would allow the appeal only to the extent that I would restore:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) Paragraph 15(d) and Answer No. 2 of Request for Further and Better Particulars;</p>        <p>(ii) Paragraph 18 subject to the deletion of the words "and/or negligence and/or breach of duty of care"; and</p>        <p>(iii) Paragraph 14 to the extent as I have indicated in paragraph 33 above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Since the Defendant is substantially successful in resisting this appeal, I would make an order nisi that the costs of the appealshould be to the Defendant in any event with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Edward Chan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Recorder of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Ms Gekko Lan, instructed by Messrs Joseph SC Chan &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Russell Coleman, instructed by Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, for the Defendant</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2003/853.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
