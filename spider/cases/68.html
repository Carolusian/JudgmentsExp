In July 1975, the plaintiff sold to the defendant certain parts of machinery under a written contractthe price for which was specified in English pounds. The goods were delivered but default was made in payment. At the time of thebreach in August, 1975, the contract sum remaining payable was Â£239.70. The prevailing rate of exchange was 11.20 Hong Kong dollarsto the pound. At the time judgment was entered it was then 8 dollars.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,684.64 being the amount in local currency of the expressed sterling amountconverted at 11.2 dollars to the pound, being the rate of conversion at the date of the breach.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> At the hearing of the action Mr. Taylor, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff company, referred me to the decision of the Houseof Lords in the recent case of <u>Miliangos v. George Frank (Tex</u>tiles) Ltd. <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20WLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 W.L.R. 758.</a> It was submitted by him that that decision did not require the court to convert the sterling claim into Hong Kong dollars at thedate when the court authorized enforcement of the judgment. He argued that the decision was inapplicable to this case and, agreeingwith him, I awarded the sum stated above, which, as I have already said took the breach-date as the date for conversion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> After giving judgment I happened to receive Part 27 of the Weekly Law Reports which contains the decision of Oliver, J. in the caseof <u>In re Dynamics Corporation of America</u> (<u>In liquidation</u>) reported in <i>[</i>1976<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 W.L.R. 757.</a> That case concerned the date for conversion of claims into sterling in liquidation proceedings.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is not necessary to set out the facts of that case save to say that certain dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Cross of Chelseain the <u>Miliangos</u> case were not followed. Speaking of the Miliangos case Oliver, J. at page 774 of the report said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The effect of the Miliangos case, so far at any rate as debts are concerned, is to negative the breach date as the appropriate datefor conversion and to give the foreign creditor the right to receive whatever is the appropriate sterling equivalent at the datewhen he enforces his judgment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Having read this dictum I considered that the matter should be re-opened and hence there has been this review.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The defendant was unrepresented, consequently I have not had the benefit of opposing argument, but I am satisfied that the judgmentformerly entered should stand. I now give my reasons for this conclusion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> As I have already stated, in this action for debt, the plaintiff has throughout claimed a sum in Hong Kong dollars. That sum is theequivalent of the sterling selling price converted as at the time of the breach. The plaintiff did not claim a specific sum in sterling,a foreign currency so far as this court is concerned. This fact, I consider, removes the application of the decision of the Houseof Lords in the <u>Miliangos</u> case. Mr. Taylor has argued that that decision is permissive and not mandatory: in other words it is open to a party to sue for asum of money expressed in a foreign country if he so chooses and where he elects not to do so then the breach date is the appropriatedate for conversion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The argument of the defendant is that the contract was for a specific sum in English pounds and that is all the plaintiff is entitledto. He contends that the vagaries of sterling should not operate against him so as to require him to pay more than its equivalentin local currency at the time of payment. Such fluctuations in sterling should be stoicly borne by the plaintiff. Although the defendanthas not made the point he might have added that, to some extent, the court rate of interest would mitigate the plaintiff's loss.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The plaintiff, on the other hand, counters this argument by saying that if the defendant had not defaulted he would have receiveda greater equivalent in Hong Kong dollars than what the defendant now suggests he should receive.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> What is the answer to these opposing views?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I start by referring to Halsbury's 3rd Edition of the Laws of England, Volume 27 page 6 paragraph 5 entitled:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"Foreign currency liabilities converted into sterling for enforcement."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%">It reads:</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          "For the purpose of enforcing any liability or obligation in the English courts all claims must be expressed in terms ofEnglish currency, since an English court cannot give judgment for the payment of a sum of money expressed in any other currency.(<u>Manners v.

For this purpose the rate of exchange for converting into sterling any sum expressed, or any damages to be calculated, in aforeign currency is generally speaking the rate prevailing commercially when payment became due or the liability to pay damages wasincurred, that is, in the case of a bill of exchange, the date of maturity, in the case of any liquidated debt the date on whichit became due and payable, in the case of damages for breach of contract, the date of breach, and in the case of damages for tort,the date when the damage or loss occurred ....."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Cases supporting the proposition that the conversion date for liquidated debts is the date when the debt became due are cited inHalsbury.

In that case it was held that in an action in England to recover the price of goods sold inFrance and payable in French currency, the correct date on which that debt ought to be converted into English money for the purposeof ascertaining the amount which the plaintiffs ought to recover, is the date when the debt became due in France.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Clauson L.J. in the course of his judgment at page 78 of the report said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          "It is now settled law in this country, since the decision of the House of Lords in <u>S.S.

Lawrence J. delivered two judgments, both in the matter of the liquidation of the <u>British American Continental Bank</u>. In the first case, <u>Goldzieher and Penso's Claim</u> <i>[</i>1922<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20Ch%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Ch. 575</a>, he had to deal with a claim for damages for breach of contract to deliver foreign currency; and in that case, as in the subsequentsimilar case, in the same liquidation, of <u>Lisser and Rosenkranz's Claim</u> <i>[</i>1923<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Ch%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Ch. 276</a> he had no difficulty in applying the principles enunciated in <u>S.S.

It changes like a weathercock withevery gust that blows. So do other currencies. This change compels us to think again about our rules. I ask myself: why do we saythat an English court can only pronounce judgment in sterling? Lord Reid in the <u>Havana</u> case thought that it was 'primarily procedural'. I think so too. It arises from the form in which we used to give judgment for money.From time immemorial the courts of common law used to give judgment in these words, 'It is adjudged that the plaintiff <u>do</u> <u>recover</u> against the defendant Â£X. in sterling'. On getting such a judgment the plaintiff could at once issue out a writ of execution forÂ£X. If it was not in sterling, the sheriff would not be able to execute it.

The claim there was for adebt (or debts) in U.S. dollars, due under a contract the proper law of which was held to be the law of Pennsylvania. The debtor(the United Havana Railways Co.) was English: the creditor was American. The proceedings were by way of proof in the liquidationof the debtor, not by action by writ, but it was not suggested that this made any difference, and I say at once that I do not thinkthat any distinction can be drawn on this ground. On the arguments presented which were at least strenuous, and after examinationof the cases extending over a long period, the House unanimously decided that the provable sum in U.S. dollars had to be convertedinto sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing when the relevant sums fell due and were not paid.

His contract has nothing to do with sterling; he has bargained for his owncurrency and only his own currency. The substance of the debtor's obligations depends on the proper law of the contract (here Swisslaw); and though English law (lex fori) prevails as regards procedural matters, it must surely be wrong in principle to allow procedureto affect, detrimentally, the substance of the creditor's rights. Courts are bound by their own procedural law and must obey if,if imperative, though to do so may seem unjust. But if means exist for giving effect to the substance of a foreign obligation, conformablywith the rules of private international law, procedure should not unnecessarily stand in the way.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          There is, unfortunately, as Lord Radcliffe pointed out in the <u>Havana Railways</u> case, a good deal of confusion in English cases as to what the creditor's rights are. Appeal has been made to the principle of nominalism,so as to say that the creditor must take the pound sterling as he finds it. Lord Denning said so in the <u>Havana Railways</u> case and I can safely and firmly disagree with him in that because he has himself, since then, come to hold another view. The creditorhas no concern with pounds sterling; for him what matters is that a Swiss franc for good or ill should remain a Swiss franc. Thisis substantially the reasoning of Holmes J. in the important judgment of US Supreme Court in <u>Deutsche Bank v. Humphrey</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281926%29%20272%20US%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1926) 272 US 517.</a> Another argument is that the 'breach date' makes for certainty whereas to choose a later date makes the claim depend on currencyfluctuations. But this is only a partial truth. The only certainty achieved is certainty in the sterling amount - but that is notin point since sterling does not enter into the bargain. The relevant certainty which the rule ought to achieve is that which givesthe creditor neither more nor less than he bargained for. He bargained for 415,522.45 Swiss francs; whatever this means in (unstipulated)foreign currencies, whichever way the exchange into those currencies may go, he should get 415,522.45 Swiss francs or as nearly ascan be brought about. That such a solution, if practicable, is just, and adherence to the 'breach-date' in such a case unjust inthe circumstances of today, adds greatly to the strength of the argument for revising the rule or, putting it more technically, itadds strength to the case for awarding delivery in specie rather than giving damages."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> A little later at page 771, of the report, Lord Wilberforce continued:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"1.

In my opinion itshould be open for future discussion whether the rule applying to money obligations, which can be a simple rule, should apply asregards claims for damages for breach of contract or for tort. It is only because it has been thought that the same rule need applyto all these situations that we have been forced into straitjacket solutions based on concepts, or on forms of action ("archaic legalisticnonsense" in the words of Lawton L.J. in <u>Schorsch Meier</u> <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i> Q.B. 416, 430). But the principles on which damages are awarded for the tort or breach of contract are both very intricate and notthe same in each case, involve questions of remoteness (of. the speech of Lord Parmoor in <u>S.S. Celia (Owners) v. S.S. Volturno (Owners), The Volturno</u> <i>[</i>1921<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20AC%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 A.C. 544)</a> and have no direct relevance to claims for specific things, in which I include specific foreign currency. To take one familiar point.Whereas in the case of the inevitable contract to supply a foreign cow, the intending purchaser has to be treated as going into themarket to buy one as at the date of breach, this doctrine cannot be applied to a foreign money obligation, for the intending creditorhas nothing to buy his own currency with - except his own currency. I therefore see no need to overrule or criticise or endorse suchcases as <u>The Volturno</u> <i>[</i>1921<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20AC%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 A.C. 544</a> or <u>Di Ferdinando v.

(<u>The Baarn</u> <i>[</i>1933<i>]</i> P.251, 266), that the former case leaves a number of difficulties unsolved and that the mere fact that as a general rule in Englishlaw damages for tort or for breach of contract are assessed as at the date of the breach need not Preclude, in particular cases,the conversion into sterling of an element in the damages, which arises and is expressed in foreign currency, as at some later date.It is for the courts, or for arbitrators, to work out a solution in each case best adapted to giving the injured plaintiff that amountin damages which will most fairly compensate him for the wrong which he has suffered. As examples in which acceptance of this principlemight have led to a juster result I may refer to The <u>Teh Hu</u> <i>[</i>1970<i>]</i> P.106 and <u>Nederlandsch-Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij N.V. v.

To this may be added the alternative "or the sterling equivalent at the date of ..."(see below). As regards the conversion date to be inserted in the claim or in the judgment of the court, the choice, as pointed outin the <u>Havana Railways</u> case <i>[</i>1966<i>]</i> A.C. 1007, is between (i) the date of action brought, (ii) the date of judgment, (iii) the date of payment. Each has its advantages,and it is to be noticed that the Court of Appeal in <u>Schorsch Meier</u> and in the present case chose the date of payment meaning, as I understand it, the date when the court authorizes enforcement ofthe judgment in terms of sterling. The date of payment is taken in the convention annexed to the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965(article 27(2)). This date gets nearest to securing to the creditor exactly what he bargained for. The date of action brought, thoughfavoured by Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe in the <u>Havana Railways</u> case, seems to me to place the creditor too severely at the mercy of the debtor's obstructive defences (cf. this case) or the law'sdelay. It may have been based on an understanding of the judgment of Holmes J. in the <u>Deutsche Bank</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=272%20US%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(272 US. 517)</a> now seen to be probably mistaken (see Mann, The Legal Aspect of Money, 3rd ed. (1971), p.355 and cases cited). The date of judgmentis shown to be a workable date in practice by its inclusion in the Carriage by Air Act 1961 which gave effect to the Hague Conventionof 1965 varying, on this very point, the Warsaw Convention of 1929, but, in some cases, particularly where there is an appeal, mayagain impose on the creditor a considerable currency risk. So I would favour the payment date, in the sense I have mentioned. Inthe case of a company in liquidation the corresponding date for conversion would be the date when the creditor's claim in terms ofsterling is admitted by the liquidator. In the case of arbitration, there may be a minor discrepancy, if the practice which is apparentlyadopted (see <u>Jugoslavenska case</u> <i>[</i>1974<i>]</i> Q.B. 292, 305) remains as it is, but I can see no reason why, if desired, that practice should not be adjusted so as to enable conversionto be made as at the date when leave to enforce in sterling is given.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          2. A rule in the form suggested above would not, in my opinion, give rise to any serious procedural difficulty.

I would say as to these matters that I see no reason why this should be so: it would be inappropriate to discuss them herein detail and unnecessary since the Court of Appeal has assessed the procedural implications and has not been impressed with anydifficulty. I have no doubt that practitioners, with the assistance of the Supreme Court, can work out suitable solutions - not overlookingthe provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1947.

That loss is normally mitigated, if not wholly compensated, by an award of interest.' ........</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Being governed by sections 26 and 36(1) of the Arbitration Act 1950, the award of American dollars in that case of necessity had tobe converted into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date when the award was made. But for that fact, the most justrate would be that prevailing when the award was being enforced, for the plaintiff had been kept out of his money until then, andI see no reason why this latter rate should not be the one adopted when judgments expressed in a foreign currency are being enforced.Accordingly, in my view the plaintiff in the present case should have been given judgment, mutatis mutandis, in the form approvedof by Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Schorsch Meier G.m.b.H. v. Hennin</u> <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i> Q.B. 416,425, namely, that:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">'It is this day adjudged that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff 416,144.20 Swiss francs or the sterling equivalent at the timeof payment.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I confess myself glad to have arrived at the conclusion that, for the reasons given in the speeches of my noble and learned friends,Lord Wilberforce and Lord Cross of Chelsea, the circumstances of today are so greatly different from those prevailing when the <u>Havana case</u> <i>[</i>1961<i>]</i> A.C. 1007 was decided 14 years ago that this House is now free to depart from it. We can therefore avoid perpetrating the great injusticewhich would result were the ratio decidendi of that case applied to the present claim. Accordingly, while respectfully finding myselfunable to regard as valid the points relied upon by Lord Denning M.R. in the <u>Schorsch Meier</u> case as justifying a departure from the <u>Havana</u> case, I would concur in dismissing this appeal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In my judgment it is clear that the decision of their Lordships is designed to secure no injustice by reason of the weakening poundsterling. Injustice would result in England today from continued adherence to the breach-date rule coupled with a prohibition againstgiving judgment in a foreign currency.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The rationale behind the decision is that, as was stated in the words of Lord Wilberforce:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... justice demands that the creditor should not suffer from fluctuations in the value of sterling."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> This decision or rather the ratio decidendi is binding on this court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The claim before this court was in Hong Kong dollars. It did not suit the plaintiff to bring his claim in sterling for the obviousreason that the Hong Kong dollar is a stronger currency. Their Lordships were not considering a case identical with this. The poundhad so lost its value that the foreign creditor suing in England stood to lose more if he were compelled to sue in sterling and wassubjected to the breach-date rule.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Mr. Taylor argues that the decision of the House of Lords is permissive to the extent that it applies where the requisite conditionsare met and where the plaintiff claims a sum in a foreign currency. He argues that the decision does not abolish the breach-daterule in actions for a liquidated sum or debt where, as in this case, the plaintiff elects to claim a sum expressed in local currency.His argument is that the plaintiff has the right to elect which way he wishes to proceed. He has pointed out that leave was givento the plaintiff in the <u>Miliangos</u> case to amend his claim from one for the sterling equivalent of the sum due in Swiss Francs as at the dates when payment should havebeen made to a claim for Swiss Francs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In my judgment the plaintiff has the right to elect which way he will proceed and there is fortification for this view both in the<u>Miliangos</u> case and in the dicta of Oliver, J. in the <u>Dynamics</u> case, <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 WLR 757.</a></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the Miliangos case it was held the court was "entitled" to give judgment for a sum of money expressed in a foreign currency butthe plaintiff must ask for it. Not that he must accept judgment in that way. The decision is permissive. The request for a judgmentin foreign currency will be adopted when it best suits the plaintiff and in England today it is difficult to imagine circumstanceswhen a plaintiff will not sue for a judgment expressed in foreign currency in view of the unhappy financial scene.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> As Lord Cross said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the court has power to give judgment for payment of money in a foreign currency."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Oliver, J. in the Dynamics case <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 W.L.R. 757</a> at page 761 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The wind of change, however bloweth where it listeth and the recent decisions of the Court of Appeal in <u>Schorsch Meier G.m.b.H. v.

George Frank (Textiles) Ltd.</u> <i>[</i>1976<i>]</i> A.C. 443 have established a different rule, namely, that at least in the cases of a debt payable in a foreign currency, as opposedto damages for breach of contract or trust, judgment may be given by an English court in the appropriate currency and that, for thepurpose of enforcement, the conversion is to be made at the date of the swearing of the affidavit leading to execution."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> In my judgment the vital words are "may be given."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> I think that when Oliver, J. said at page 774 of the report,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The effect of the Miliangos case, so far at any rate as debts are concerned, is to negative the breach date as the appropriate datefor conversion and to give the foreign creditor the right to receive whatever is the appropriate sterling equivalent at the datewhen he enforces his judgment",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">          the learned judge was not as was suggested to me, being contradictory. He was saying in effect that where judgment is beingsought in a foreign currency in the circumstances envisaged in the <u>Miliangos</u> case then the breach date for conversion is negatived. If it were not it would be pointless in suing for foreign currency.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I do not think their Lordships were adverting to the effect the judgment would have in other parts of the Commonwealth but were proceedingon the basis of doing justice to the parties suing in the English courts. The ratio decidendi is, I think, clear. I do not thinktheir Lordships had in mind a case such is now under consideration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In my judgment, the decision in the Miliangos case does not erase the breach date as the proper date for conversion in appropriatecases and one such case is where, in Hong Kong, the plaintiff elects to sue for a liquidated sum or debt expressed in the contractin respect of which the action is brought in terms of sterling but claimed in local currency.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The plaintiff was deprived of his money for a period beyond that agreed to between the parties. He should not suffer a loss as aresult of the depreciation of the foreign currency in the meanwhile.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> For these reasons I confirm my judgment previously given.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(F.
