The nature of the confidential information was not particularized.The lack of particularity was a blatant breach of O.18 r.12.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:left">(iii) The reliefs sought were window-dressing rather than true claims for breaches of contract or breaches of fiduciary duties.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:left">(iv) The Labour Tribunal ought to have exclusive jurisdiction over employment disputes.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Directions have been given by Court at the call over hearing of these summonses for the parties to file their affidavits in oppositionand then in reply.  The plaintiff filed no affidavit in opposition to the defendantsâ application despite the Courtâs directions.</p>        <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The plaintiff evaded its obligation to file its affidavit evidence in opposition to the striking out application by providing voluntaryparticulars of the factual occurrence of the events at this hearing.  The facts averred to in these voluntary particulars made referenceto incidents happening between January 2007 and February 2007 involving Su and Ma.  The particulars stated contain clear allegationsof tortious acts including copying as well as deletion of computer data from the plaintiffâs computer records.  These voluntaryparticulars did not form part of the pleadings of the plaintiff nor were they deposed to on oath or by way of affirmation.  The practiceof providing voluntary particulars in lieu of affidavits should be discouraged as this deprived the defendants a proper chance torespond to the contentions contained therein.</p>        <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> On the other hand, it is also true to say the defendants have breached the paragraph 5 of PD 19.1 in failing to inform the plaintiffwithin time of the broad grounds upon which the defendants relied upon to seek to strike out the plaintiffâs pleadings for disclosingno reasonable cause of action.</p>        <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The focal points of concern are: (i) whether the pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause of action; (ii) whether there were sufficientparticulars to justify a reasonable cause of action as opposed to presenting sheer window dressing causes and reliefs within HighCourt jurisdiction; and (iii) whether these 2 claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>        <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> As the pleadings now stand one cannot dispute the fact that the allegations of breaches contained therein were vague and non-specific. The confidential nature of the information has not been disclosed.  Information contained in the voluntary particulars bridged partof the gap in providing details of tortious acts of data copying and data deletion, which is beyond what has been pleaded in theoriginal pleadings.</p>        <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Should the plaintiff include in its pleadings the factual contentions stated in its voluntary particulars, providing details aboutthe confidential nature of the information, one cannot say the causes of action and reliefs sought are window dressing exercises.</p>        <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The lack of particulars does not provide an outright basis for striking out if the deficiency can be remedied by way of amendmentsor the supply of particulars pursuant to requests.  Though it cannot be disputed that the primary duty to particularize details withinits pleadings to meet the requirements under O.18 r.12 rests with the plaintiff.</p>        <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> On the consideration of exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal there have been significant judicial debates in the past 20years.</p>        <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Sir Denys in <i>National Ebauch</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 114</a> (decision of 19 January 1981), after analysing the legislative bill, came to a pragmatic determination and ruled the words âa sumof moneyâ within the Labour Tribunal meant âan ascertained sumâ.</p>        <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Hunter, J in the subsequent decision of <i>Panalpina</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 275</a> (decision of 16 June 1983), after lamenting about the inflexibility of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> and the suitability of having the determination of an action in accounts in the High Court, came to a legalistic construction andfound the words âa sum of moneyâ referred to âquantified claimsâ though the claim could be for unliquidated damages.</p>        <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Chung, J in <i>Cabaya</i> HCLA 93/2003 (decision of 28 April 2004) gone through a detailed legislative interpretation of the phrase âa sum of moneyâ andpreferred the determination of Hunter, J.</p>        <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The matter eventually reached the Court of Appeal for determination in <i>Citipost</i> CACV 111/2004 (decision of 8 February 2005) in which Rogers V-P adopted the approach of Hunter, J and accepted the phrase âa sumof moneyâ within the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> meant the claim must be quantified but not necessarily liquidated.</p>        <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Sakharni, J was confronted with the same exercise in <i>Gain Hill</i> HCA 1321/2006 (decision of 31 August 2006) in which Sakharni, J found ââ¦ I accept that the dispute between the parties arisesfrom the relationship of employer and employee but that does not mean that the causes of action are founded merely in contract. The claim for damages and injunctive relief for breach of confidence is founded both in contract and in tort.â  The ruling reachedwas: - âThe claim for damages for breach of confidence is founded both in contract and in tort.  It would fall within paragraph1(a) as being within the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal but it would be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunalunder paragraph 3 as being a claim for a sum of money in respect of a cause of action âfounded in tort whether arising from a breachof contract or a breach of duty imposed by a rule of common lawâ¦...â.â</p>        <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Factually I do accept in the present case the injunctive reliefs prayed for have not been proceeded with more than a year after thepurported breaches.  The urgency to apply for an injunction to prevent future breaches can hardly be pressing and such reliefs arelikely academic even if the right exists.</p>        <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Actions involving claims for secret profits, duty to account, breach of confidence and use of trade secrets would likely involveintrigue facts entailing protracted legal arguments for which the assistance of legal representation would have enhanced the presentationof the case.</p>        <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In a contract of employment, terms existed to delineate the duration and the scope of service as well as to reflect the considerationfor the service and the benefit to be provided to the employee.  Terms are often written in to govern the standard and quality ofthe service to be furnished by the employee.  Provisions touching on the employment conditions, dealing with wages, holiday, financialbenefits, welfare of an employee and the like should rightly be attended to in the Tribunal, be the claim liquidated or unliquidated.</p>        <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> When one is considering whether an employee breaches his duty of confidentiality (contractually written or implied) or has actedin breach of his other duties (common law or statutory) for acts done in the course of his employment (e.g. to steal from oneâsown employer as in the case of <i>4M Goldmec Jewelry</i> DCCJ 5902/2005), one is talking about the incidental acts of the employee whilst at work.  The employee can hardly be said to becarrying out his duties under his employment contract when he performed tortious acts against the interest of his employer.  Forexample, in outright case of theft from the employer, the Court does not need to look at the employeeâs employment contract andconstrue the terms therein to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties.</p>        <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Even if the tortious scenario is within the contemplation of the parties and had been reduced into writing in employment contractas a prohibitory duty, paragraph 3 of the Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> comes in aid to clarify the situation and remove such tortious claims from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>        <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In <i>Gain Hill</i> Sakranki, J pointed out that in <i>Citipost</i> Rogers V-P decided the High Court rightly ordered a stay of the proceeding in pure employment claims when the tortious acts complainedof were no more than window dressing to masquerade the genuine nature of the underlying employment dispute.</p>        <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> What was supplied in the voluntary particulars by the plaintiff gave rise to a clear plea of tortious liability which brings theclaim out of the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  Without those particulars the claims are vague and non-specific which lacksdetails to justify the claim to constitute a reasonable cause of action.  I also note the voluntary particulars failed to particularizethe confidential nature of the information.  The injunction intended is an academic issue in light of the time lapse.  In any eventthe right to an injunction hinges upon the subsistence of a reasonable cause of action to begin with.</p>        <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Hence for each of the 2 summonses I do allow âLeave to strike out the plaintiffâs pleadings as disclosing no reasonable causeof action and the action to be dismissed unless the pleadings in the action are amended to disclose a reasonable cause of actionwithin 14 days from the day of this order.â</p>        <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Though the defendants have failed to abide by paragraph 5 of PD 19.1 to provide the plaintiff with their broad grounds of applicationwithin time, the primary duty rests with the plaintiff to disclose sufficient particulars to justify a reasonable cause of actionto commence a proceeding.
