The history of the matter is as follows: Thepresent appellant - the Hang Tak Company Ltd. is the owner of a 24 storey building in Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong. The plot wherethis building now stands was previously occupied by six pre-war houses numbered 184, 184A, 186, 188, 190, 192 Queen's Road Central.In 1964 there were several tenants inhabiting the premises among them the 1st and 2nd defendants who are directors of the 3rd defendantcompany and who were then carrying on the business of that company on the ground floor of No.184A. This property they held underlease from the plaintiff company the latter having become in 1963 the assignee of the residue of the Crown lease of No.184 and 184Asubject to existing lettings and tenancies including the 3rd defendant company's lease. It was a term of this lease, which had originallybeen made with the 1st and 2nd defendants as lessees before the formation of their limited company, that the defendants would waivetheir protection against ejectment under the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance. The lease expired on the 30th of November 1964.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The exclusion order, covering the other premises upon the site, had been obtained on the footing of a scheme presented to the TenancyTribunal embodying the plaintiff company's expressed intention of developing the site by erecting thereon a building of 16 storeysto be used as to the ground floor premises for shop space and as the upper floors for offices. The order dated 27th of November 1964required the plaintiff to commence work on the site within six months thereof. So far as the tenants of the other premises were concernedno difficulty appears to have arisen and all these tenants had vacated their several premises by the end of December 1964. The defendantsand the defendant company however, notwithstanding the covenant in their lease, refused to give up possession although they had beenwarned by letter in late November of the plaintiff company's intention to demolish and rebuild and of the possibility that the defendantswould be held responsible for any loss which might arise upon the failure to deliver up possession at the conclusion of the term.Following upon a letter couched in similar terms in early December the 3rd defendant company through its solicitors claimed thatthe plaintiff company's predecessors in title had by letter, prior to the assignment of the lease to the plaintiff company, givento the defendants and the defendant company an option to renew the five years' term for another like period.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff company sued for possession claiming in addition $850 arrears of rent for November 1964 and mesne profits at a rateto be assessed by the Court from the 1st of December 1964 until Judgment or possession. This writ was issued on the 8th of December1964. The defendant and the defendant company pleaded the option by way of defence and, by way of counterclaim, asked for a declarationthat the 3rd defendant company was entitled to the grant of a further lease of five years and two months commencing from the 1stof December 64. The defence and counterclaim were filed on the 1st of March 1965. There were some further pleadings and the actioncame on for hearing before Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr on the 21st of June 1965. The hearing, which occupied a number of days, concludedon the 1st of July 1965 and judgment was reserved.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Such is the outline of the facts and history of the case up to trial. They appear in very much greater detail in both the judgmentof Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr and in the ruling on assessment of damages delivered by the Deputy Registrar on the 21st of January 1970pursuant to the Judge's order. This somewhat abbreviated outline of the facts is, however, sufficient for the purpose of sketchingin the background to the present appeal and only one further matter of detail need be mentioned. On the first day of the trial, thestatement of claim was, with the leave of the Court, amended to include, among other matters, particulars of damage in the followingterms: "Damages resulting from delay in commencing and effecting the redevelopment of Nos.184, 184A, 186, 188, 190 and 192 Queen'sRoad Central namely:-</p>	<blockquote>		(a) any fine premium or penalty which may be imposed by the Hong Kong Government;<p>(b) loss of rents and profits from the building to be constructed on the abovesaid property at $73,193 per month."</p>	</blockquote>    <p align="left">The prayer was consequentially amended by adding, in relation to this head of damage, a prayer claiming: "in the alternative, a declarationthat the defendants are liable to pay such damages to the plaintiff."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The learned trial Judge rejected the defendants allegation as to an option and dismissed the counterclaim depending thereon. He acceptedthe plaintiff company's contention that the redevelopment scheme presented to the Tenancy Tribunal had been held up by the defendants'holding over unlawfully and in breach of covenant after the expiration of their lease. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for possessionand he made orders for arrears of rent and mesne profits as claimed in items 2 and 3 of the prayer at the conclusion of the writ.Mesne profits under this head were confined to a sum equivalent to the monthly rent of the ground floor of 184A from the 30th ofNovember to the date of recovery of possession at the rate of $850 per month. It is not in dispute that the keys to the premiseswere in fact given up by the defendants to the plaintiff company sometime in June 1965 during the course of the hearing, the defendantshaving vacated the premises by then. Nor is it disputed that since the conclusion of the hearing before the trial judge mesne profitsup to the date of delivery of possession have in fact been paid by the defendants to the plaintiff company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> When he came to confront the assessment of damages other than the mesne profits awarded, however, the learned trial judge found himselfin some difficulty. Because the 16-storey building was yet unbuilt he preferred, in view of the many variables in the market situationto make no prospective award. He contented himself, therefore, with making the declaration claimed by the plaintiff company in itsalternative pleading and further ordered that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants should pay to the plaintiff such damages for theirholding over as might be assessed by the Registrar on the completion of the new building.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It was pursuant to this order that the Deputy Registrar, Mr. Oliver held his inquiry. It commenced on the 18th of November 1969 continuedon several days thereafter and concluded on the 24th of November. In a lengthy ruling delivered on the 21st January, 1970, he awardednominal damages in the sum of $1 to the plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The principal witness for the plaintiff company, both at the trial of the action and at the subsequent inquiry by the Deputy Registrar,was Mr. T.H. Chan, one of the company's directors. His testimony indeed involves the greater part of the record of the evidence inboth proceedings. And from these two bodies of evidence emerges the central peculiarity of this case which has given to the appealthe feeling of an exercise in paradox. The paradox resides in the fact that Mr. Cheung for the plaintiff company has had to approachthe Court for the assessment of the quantum of a loss which strictly speaking has never recurred. The facts are these: the defendantsheld over in breach of their covenant to vacate and did so wrongfully, as the trial judge found, for a period of six months afterthe expiry of their lease. Throughout those six months, between December and June when the trial concluded, the plaintiff companywas in possession of approved plans permitting it to commence the construction of a 16-storey building. In February, 1965, however,with the failure of the Canton Trust Bank there commenced that series of commercial alarms and crises which so gravely disturbedthe economic stability of the Colony for the next two years and which, at the hearing of this action, as in colloquial usage generallysince that time, has been familiarly referred to as "the bank crisis". Sometime after the bank crisis and before the trial of theaction the plaintiff company, alarmed by the omens of the market, conceived an alternative scheme of 24 storeys to offset the lossanticipated upon the general fall in rentals and in March 1965 alternative plans for such a building were actually submitted to theBuilding Authority for approval.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> At the commencement of the trial therefore there were, to put the matter neutrally, two alternative building schemes in prospect.It is to be noted that these were true alternatives in the fullest legal and technical senses. It was not the case that the plaintiffcompany might have embarked upon the smaller scheme and then, if the occasion demanded, have permitted that scheme, as it were, togrow beyond the original compass of 16 storeys. The two schemes were different and mutually exclusive in that different ground plansand plot ratios would need to be submitted and approved. And also the individual flats were different in area and layout. This isa factor of the greatest importance in relation to the plaintiff company's interpretation of the trial judge's order for assessmentof damages. The extraordinary fact is that at the trial no whisper of this alternative 24 storey scheme was ever permitted to reachthe ears of the trial judge. He had of course, mainly been concerned with the question of lawful possession, but when he came todirect his attention to the assessment of damages for wrongful holding over did so on the basis of evidence which was wholly restrictedto the 16 storey scheme. So far as he was concerned the matter was clear enough in that regard. The defendants had held over andwere continuin to hold over during a time when the plaintiffs were fully ready to commence the demolition of the existing buildingand to proceed thereafter with the erection of the sixteen storey scheme. Once the trial judge, therefore had found that the defendantswere in wrongful possession, the plaintiff company's right damages other than mesne profits was complete and the only question remainingwas quantum. He declined to consider quantum because of a natural hesitation in relation to the possible performance of the marketbetween the date of his order and the conclusion of the scheme. In leaving the assessment of damages to the Registrar he may be assumedto have done so because it seemed obvious that by the time the Registrar came to consider the matter answers to all the necessaryeconomic questions would be readily available. No doubt he did not consider that the Registrar would be presented with any very difficulttask.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> When the matter came on before the Deputy Registrar however Mr. T.H. Chan gave evidence that the 16-storey scheme had been abandonedand the 24 storey scheme had been implemented and the 24 storey building had finally been completed in 1968 the occupation permithaving been issued in October of that year. Confronted with this situation the learned Deputy Registrar was not unnaturally afflictedwith doubts as to his position. To these he gave expression in the following terms at paragraph 6 of his ruling.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"6. Having heard the evidence and listened to counsel for 4 days, I propose to do my best to assess damages. I do so, however withsome misgiving. It may well be that a strict interpretation of the declation which Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr made restricts the referenceto a 16-storey building, and as it was not built, it is not open to me to assess damages now that a different has been erected."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He resolved these doubts, however, by reference to certain legal principles relating to remoteness of damage and at paragraph 8 ofhis ruling he said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"8. I interpret my position as that of an assessor who has been directed by a judge that the wrongful holding over was capable ofgiving rise to a claim for damages, and it is now for me as an assessor to find as a fact whether particular heads of damage havein fact arisen and further what damage has been suffered."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> With this part of the ruling, though with very little else that appeared therein, Mr. Cheung for the plaintiff company is in whole-heartedagreement. He has boldly and fairly appreciated the somewhat artificial character of his client's claim and has sought to pursueits implications to a logical conclusion. Initially he made it clear that his clients were not seeking consequential damage arisingfrom any delay in the completion of the 24 storey scheme. Further he not merely admits but proclaims that the alteration from the16 to 24 storey scheme was in no way attributable to anything done by the defendants. This was the result of his clients' own choiceafter the bank crisis and to that decision the delay occasioned by the defendants holding over has in no way been a contributorycause. In other words, he accepts the view that the trial judge's finding as to consequential damage is referable wholly and solelyto the 16 storey scheme. He is not disconcerted by the fact that the 16 storey building has not been completed and he asks me toaccept the evidence which was put before the Deputy Registrar that had the 16 storey scheme proceeded and had the defendants notimpeded it by holding over, it would have been successfully completed by the month of July 1966. What I must do therefore, he says,is what the Deputy Registrar declined to do viz: to make a finding on the figures put before the Deputy Registrar as to what unitsin such a building would have fetched by way of rent between July 1966 and December of that year. The total thus arrived at on thebasis of $1.20 per square foot for office space and $4.50 per square foot for ground floor shop space comes to some $230,000 odd.He says that a sum in the region of this figure is a true and proper award made in accordance with the direction given by the learnedtrial judge. He acknowledges the fact that, as it transpired, his clients' foresight in altering the scheme and erecting a 24 storeybuilding had left him with a more profitable asset at the time of the Deputy Registrar's assessment and that his clients' financialposition at that date was better than it would have been had he completed the 16 storey scheme. Since, however, the alteration tothe latter scheme was not in any way due to the act of the defendants the fruits of his acumen should be regarded as res inter aliosacta or, as the case law otherwise puts it, they were the result of a transaction wholly collateral to the defendants' wrongful act.These profits were therefore not to be brought into account in assessing the amount of damage which the defendants' act would havedone had the 16 storey building been built.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Notwithstanding his hesitations, the Deputy Registrar pursuant to the duty cast upon him by the trial judge, undertook the task ofcarving out of the existing 24 storey building a notional 16 storey building completed in July 1966 and of ascribing to units thereinaverage rental values based on evidence concerning real buildings in and around that period and that place. He did not however makethe award sought by the plaintiff company but he escaped from the general unreality of the situation by pursuing the game of makebelieveto what he conceived to be its logical conclusion. The plaintiff company had made it clear that it was basing its claim on the provenrental values for flats in such a building. On the basis of evidence which showed that the plaintiff company, in many other developmentschemes, adhered to a policy of selling rather than renting, the Deputy Registrar refused to believe, notwithstanding their contentionsto the contrary, that they would ever have engaged upon a different policy in relation to this particular building. Since, therefore,prices in 1966 were disastrously low and since the company was on the date of assessment, in possession of a number of flats in thenew 24 storey building which were still unsold despite a highly favourable market, he preferred to assume that they would have donelikewise had the 16 storey building been completed in 1966. In other words he held that, pursuing their policy of sale, they wouldhave held on to the 16 storey flats until the market recovered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The logical consequence of this view was that since, on the evidence before him, the market at the date of assessment was as favourableto developers as it had been in January 1965, before the bank crisis, the plaintiff company had effectively lost nothing by beingheld out of possession. For that reason he awarded nominal damages of $1 to the plaintiff company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In the upshot the award has satisfied neither party. Mr. Cheung, for the plaintiff company, although he upholds the Deputy Registrar'sdecision to implement the direction of the trial judge by endeavouring to wring an assessment of damage from this compositum of hypotheses,vigorously disagrees with his finding that the plaintiff company did not intend to rent the flats in the 16 storey building and wouldhave sold them. He fortifies his other objections to this finding, based on a detailed examination of the evidence, by observingthat it appears to be in conflict with a finding of fact by the trial judge viz: that a rent producing building was in contemplationat the time of the trial.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Zimmern, on the other hand, although the award has wholly relieved his client from the anxiety of a huge judgment debt, is equallyill pleased with the course taken by the Deputy Registrar and has with equal vigour pressed upon me the view that he was, in thecircumstances, not entitled to make any award at all. Both counsel have informed me that the Deputy Registrar, at the commencementof the hearing before him, did express doubts as to his jurisdiction to assess damage on the basis of an order which referred toa wholly different set of circumstances from those before him. Mr. Zimmern who appeared on behalf of the defendants did not takethe point of jurisdiction in limine but he told me that he did urge it upon the Deputy Registrar at the conclusion of the evidenceas a necessary consequence of that evidence and as a total answer to the plaintiffs' claim. Indeed it seems to me that there aregood reasons why the Deputy Registrar should not have dealt with the point as a preliminary point in relation to jurisdiction. Untilthe evidence before him was well advanced it would not have been possible for him to say to what degree the alternative scheme hadproceeded; what new plans had been required what delay might have attributable to the approval of such plans or what relationshipthat delay might bear to the delay allegedly occasioned by the holding over having regard to the development scheme as a whole.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> For my part I take the view that the key to this peculiar puzzle is to be found in the language used by the learned trial judge ingiving his direction. At page 12 of his judgment he adverts to the fact that there are many factors to be considered in estimatingthe question of damages and he says:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... and there is no doubt that damages could be assessed with far greater accuracy when the building has been completed and rentedto the new tenants. It would then be possible for the whole redevelopment scheme to be viewed in proper perspective and the realextent of the damage caused by the defendants will be capable of being assessed much more accurately than at present."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Earlier, at the beginning of that page, he summarizes the results of the defendants' breach of covenant in the words: "the whole schemehas been held up." To my mind, it is abundantly clear that in these passages he is referring to the 16 storey scheme, the only schemein respect of which there was any evidence before him, and also that he was purporting to make an exhaustive provision for the assessmentof damages on the basis of that evidence. It is equally certain that, had any suggestion been made before him that there was an alternativescheme in the wind, his order as to assessment must necessarily have reflected this alternative possibility.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The undisputed evidence of Mr. T.H. Chan before the Deputy Registrar was that the plaintiff company had, at the beginning of March,submitted plans to the Building Authority for a 24 storey building and were at that time, because of the bank crisis, seriously contemplatingsubstituting this scheme for the former. Yet at the trial the plaintiff company through its witness maintained a total silence unbrokenby even the most oblique reference to this alternative possibility. It is scarcely surprising that Mr. T.H. Chan was subjected torigorous cross-examination on the subject of this extraordinary silence. It is clear that counsel there took the line which he hastaken before me and which was that the plaintiff company had altered its plan immediately after the bank crisis and had effectivelyabandoned the original scheme. Both counsel dwelt at some length upon answers given by the witness in the course of this cross-examination.Mr. Zimmern asks me to say that Mr. T.H. Chan is quite simply a liar and he points out that there is a very good reason why the witness,if he wished to recover these damages, should willfully conceal the plaintiff company's true intention at the time of the trial.The keys of the premises together with possession thereof had been returned to the plaintiff company in the course of the trial whichtook place in June 1965. At that date the plaintiff company presenting its case on the basis of a 16 storey scheme for which theplans had been approved had not yet received the approval of the Building Authority for the 24 storey building plan without thatapproval they were not in a position to set the new scheme in motion. If therefore, they were to ask the judge for additional damagesfor delay to their building scheme resulting from the holding over, they were confronted with the difficulty that the holding overwhile still an invasion of the company's rights as proprietor was an effective cause of delay only in relation to the 16 and notto the 24 storey scheme. As it transpires, the Building Authority approved the new plans in July, about a month after the conclusionof the action before Blair-Kerr J. the plaintiff company, therefore, for something over one month after they had recovered possessionwere still unable to start upon the scheme which was the one they eventually chose and which was completed in 1968. Mr. Zimmern thereforeasks with some justice where is the damage resulting from the defendants' holding over.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Cheung fairly admits the strangeness of his clients' stance in asking for these damages. But his position has been consistantthroughout and whatever it may lack in the feeling of reality it has at least been maintained with an unswerving logic. He asks meto discern in the solid building which is now standing on the site a ghostly, notional building of 16 storeys. He asks me to do sobecause this is the building which the trial judge directed the Registrar to concern himself with. The order of the trial judge mustbe implemented and, approached from the angle of this legal imperative it is the present building which is insubstantial; it is thatbuilding which intrudes like a ghost upon the territory created by the Judge's order. Counsel will, I trust, forgive me, for puttingthe matter fancifully but it is difficult to state it clearly without finding oneself drawn into fantasy. Indeed I could not helpfeeling that Mr. Cheung himself, in making his submission on the question of causation, found his argument, insensibly, drawn inthe same direction. In this connection he cited the case of <u>Baker v. Willoughby</u> (1970) 2 Weekly Law Reports p.50. That was an action on a claim for damages for personal injuries. The plaintiff had, through thetort of the defendant, incurred an injury to his knee which caused it to be stiff. Subsequently, and before the trial of the action,he was the victim of a shooting incident involving bank robbers and as a result the injured log had to be wholly amputated. It wasargued for the defendant that the result of his tort had been obliterated by the later wrongful act which was therefore be consideredthe sole cause of the total degree of his disability at the time that he appeared before the court. The court rejected this viewand I do not find it necessary to discuss the reasons given for doing so. Mr. Cheung himself admitted that he could at best drawanalogical support from this decision. He conceded that it could only be made to apply to the circumstances of this case if one wereto make alterations in a certain number of the essential features of the case. Thus it could be said to be of direct assistance,if, in particular, one were to consider that the 16 storey building had actually been completed and that its completion had beendelayed not alone by the overholding of the defendants but in addition by the act of some third party as, for instances, the negligenceof some contractor engaged upon the construction of it. Although he was not relying upon this decision as direct authority for theproposition he put in relation to double causation, nevertheless the concession he felt it necessary to make in respect of applyingit seems to me to have a peculiar relevance in pointing up the flaw in his client's position. That flaw may be described by sayingthat the company complains of damage caused by the defendants in delaying the completion of a building scheme which was not evencommenced although it is admitted that the cause of non commencement had nothing to do with any act of the defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. Cheung has made it clear that he deprecates the silence of his clients on the topic of the 24 storey building when he was givingevidence to the trial judge. He asks me to say nevertheless that even had that evidence been given, the trial judge would neverthelesshave made an order in exactly the same terms as that which he made viz: that at the conclusion of the building scheme the Registrarshould assess damages if any. I find it impossible to accept this contention. It seems to me that Mr. Zimmern has got close to theroot of the matter when he points out that on the basis of a 24 storey scheme the judge would have to found it impossible to makeany award of consequential damage in favour of the plaintiff company. To that contention there is however one possible reservation.It has been accepted by both sides that before the developer commences the actual work of putting up a building he must have in hispossession plans approved by the Building Authority. It is accepted that as far as the 24 storey scheme is concerned the plaintiffcompany was not in possession of such plans at the date upon which the defendants had returned possession of the premises to them.The evidence however showed that the holding over had delayed not merely the commencement of the building but also the demolitionof the existing buildings upon the site. It appears to be agreed that no special permission has to be obtained for this demolition.It would therefore strictly speaking be open to the plaintiff company to say that although possession was returned in the month ofJune and although the approval of plans for the 24 storey building had not come through until about a month later the company neverthelesssuffered from the holding over to the extent that they were unable to demolish to building until late in June. Evidence, which Ithink has been uncontested, was given to the effect that demolition of the existing building would take perhaps two and a half months.If all these facts had been placed before the trial judge, he might, therefore, have been able to find that, even in relation tothe 24 storey scheme, some degree of damage might have accrued from the holding over if it should later transpire that the buildingplan for that scheme had been approved by the building authority earlier than two and a half months from the handing back of possessionby the defendants to the plaintiff company. It might therefore have been as, Mr. Cheung suggests, that even if all the evidence hadbeen before him, trial judge might yet have made an order concerning assessment of damages by the Registrar.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is true of course, that the plaintiff company did not approach the Registrar, and it does not approach me, asking for an assessmentof damages based upon the 24 storey scheme but there is this advantages to be gained for the plaintiff company if I were to accedeto Mr. Cheung's contention that, the matter being at large before me, I might feel impelled to make an award on such a basis, utmagis valeat quam pereat, taking the view that the trial judge's direction was one for assessment of damages in relation to whateverform the scheme finally took.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> There has been no want of agreement between counsel on both sides as to the basic principles upon which damages should be awarded.In particular both proclaim the root principle that a defendant must be made liable for all such damage and only for such damage,as he must have foreseen as likely to flow from the act complained of. Again, counsel have pressed upon me that this appeal is byway of rehearing. It might be said therefore that, if there is a discernable method whereby, upon the evidence placed before theDeputy Registrar, the direction given by the trial judge could receive a reasonable implementation, I should do so although havingno direct instruction from the trial judge on the question of the 24 storey scheme. I take it therefore that Mr. Cheung in drawingmy attention this point relating to time for demolition of the building has done so in order to invite me to say, even if the plaintiffcompany has suffered no loss in relation to the 16 storey scheme, there has nevertheless been a real loss in relation to the 24 storeyscheme or possibly that there has been a real loss whether one looks at the scheme as one for 16 or for 24 storeys. I think I wouldfeel some reluctance in so finding more especially as, in order to make an assessment, it would be necessary to take further evidencerelating to many new factors concerning the 24 storey scheme although the case has throughout been presented upon the basis of the16 storey scheme. But even if I were to conclude that I have the right so to interpret the direction of the trial judge it seemsto me that there are good reasons why I should not do so.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Zimmern invited to me to take the view that the order obtained from the trial judge by the plaintiff company was obtained bya course of conduct which was no better than trickery. The most vigorous part of the cross examination of T.H. Chan was designedto show that the plaintiff company from March 1965 at the latest had already altered its intention in relation to the building schemeand had decided upon putting up a 24 storey building. He asked me to conclude that because they realized, when the case came on fortrial, that, since no building lan had yet been approved for the new scheme, they were in difficult in claiming any consequentialdamages on the basis of delay to that scheme, they therefore quite brazenly pretended that they were proposing to continue the 16storey scheme i.e. the scheme in respect of which their right to such consequential damage was already perfected. If that was Mr.Chan's position at the trial then his concealment of it cannot be regarded as other than a grave abuse of the process of the Court.However, while it is unmistakable upon the record that Mr. Chan was extremely uncomfortable in this part of his cross-examination,I am not wholly convinced that his replies, surprising as many of them seem, are to be interpreted as a total breakdown of his originalcontention or a final admission under pressure, of an intention contrary to that upon which his claim was originally based. I thinkthat the evidence at large is equally consonant with the view, which the witness strove to put forward, that he and his company atthe date of the trial had not yet finally determined upon the nature of the scheme. I think it is not improbable that, at that period,full of speculation and uncertainty as it was on both the political and economic fronts, the company may have wished to provide fortwo possible schemes without, at that stage, being finally committed to either of them. Even if this be the truth however the evidenceof Mr. Chan can scarcely escape criticism. Even if it was not down right untrue it is vitiated by a most unfortunate economy in thatmatter which would clearly have been of the greatest interest and assistance to the trial judge was deliberately omitted therefrom.It is true that the issue of consequential damage played a very subordinate part in the trial of the action and it may be thereforethat the evidence given by Mr. Chan to the trial judge reflects the fact that at that stage the 16 storey building was still theleading possibility. It may be also, as Mr. Cheung has intimated, that the omission was made without an appreciation of the significantinferences which now seem apt to be drawn therefrom and that it was the result of ill advice on the part of the plaintiff company'ssolicitors in the belief that to introduce evidence concerning the alternative scheme, while that was still tentative, would unnecessarilycomplicate what was a subsidiary issue and, on relfection I prefer to regard this omission as the result of bad advice rather thanbad faith.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The plaintiff company however, having completed the larger and more profitable scheme, has sought to pursue an order which can onlyhave been granted to them on the basis of this omission. It must be obvious that of all the possible orders which Mr. Justice Blair-Kerrmight have made had the evidence been fully before him, the only one of which one can say with some degree of certainty that it wouldnot have made was that which the plaintiff now seeks to enforce viz: an order wholly restricted to consequential damage arising froma 16 storey scheme. The plaintiff company therefore can scarcely complain if it has forfeited the sympathetic consideration of thecourt in relation to the possible alternative of an assessment on the basis of a 24 storey scheme. I must however consider that possibility.If it were the case, as Mr. Zimmern suggests, that the plaintiff company had decided upon the new scheme in March of 1965 then itwould follow that they have been held out in possession for a period of about 4 months from the date of that decision by the defendant'soverholding. There are two possibilities resulting therefrom which could be urged in their favour. Firstly there is the point I havealready mentioned, that even although plans had not been approved for the 24 storey building, the company was prevented from demolishingthe existing building. And this, as I have pointed out, might have left them with a good claim to damages for delay to that schemefor a period of perhaps a month and a half prior to recovery of possession on the basis of two and a half months demolition time.The answer to this however is that, on the evidence, even when they got back possession in the month of June, a further four monthselapsed before any steps were taken to demolish those buildings. Even if their alternative view of the matter were adopted thereforeand even if it could be said that they had established a bare right damages in respect of the 24 storey scheme there could no goodclaim in equity to such damages in view of the conduct of the plaintiff company itself. Indeed in this regard Mr. Zimmern's contentionwas more favourable to the plaintiff company's case than was the opposing contention of counsel for the plaintiff company. For ifthe company had changed its mind already in March it might have been left with some legal claim to damages in respect of the delayto the 24 storey scheme whereas in fact Mr. Cheung argued that the decision to change the scheme came only after plans for the 24storey building had been approved. If that was the case then even that slender basis for an award is removed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> At the commencement of the hearing before me Mr. Cheung in outlining the facts, said that between October 1965 and February 1966the plaintiff gave instructions to his contractors to put up a 24 storey building. This would certainly seem to account for the otherwiseinexplicable delay in demolition once possession had been recovered by the plaintiff company. What seems to emerge finally from thesecontentions and from the evidence on which they are based, is that, as late as October 1965, some four months after recovery of possession,the entire building scheme, whether regarded as a 16 or 24 storey scheme, was being delayed neither by the holding over nor yet bythe failure to obtain approval for plans but by the plaintiff company's own state of indecision. If that is the truth there can beno question of any consequential damage to the either scheme arising from the holding over since it has never been suggested thatit was the holding over which caused the plaintiff company to hesitate.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It seems to me that Mr. Zimmern's surprise, and even his indignation, at the conduct of the plaintiff company in approaching theDeputy Registrar for an assessment of damages is, in the circumstances, justified. What it amounts to is that the plaintiff company,either by careless omission, or else by culpable suppression of facts, obtained from the trial judge an order that it was entitledto damages. That order was referable to one only of two possible and mutually exclusive sets of circumstances which, though the factwas not disclosed, were in contemplation at the time of the trial. The trial judge prudently declined to assess prospective lossand the subsequent trend of events has amply justified his caution. Had all these facts been placed before him, the consequentialorder or assessment, if any such order were made, could only have been made in terms which reflected the uncertainty of the entiresituation. In other words, it would have been an order for the assessment by the Deputy Registrar of damage occasioned to the plaintiffcompany by the holding over of the defendants in relation only to the 16 storey scheme should that scheme be the one which eventuated.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> It seems to me that the plaintiff company is fairly caught on the horns of a dilemma conjured up by itself. It had an order for theassessment of damages from the trial judge which it wished to implement. That Order related to consequential damage from a delayedbuilding scheme. It could not, however, ask the Deputy Registrar to assess damages for delay to the later scheme because, (a) thetrial judge's order clearly related to the 16 storey scheme; (b) the defendants could, in any event, only be made liable to suchdamages as they could have foreseen to be the likely result of the act in holding over and they have been specifically warned bythe plaintiff company that the likely result was the holding up of the 16 storey scheme; (c) no damage could be shown to have resultedto the 24 storey scheme arising directly from the defendants' holding over. But basic to the appellant company's difficulty was thefact that the 16 storey scheme never achieved reality. It was this, I am convinced, which caused them to adopt a contradictory attitudein relation to the damage which they claimed. This may be more readily appreciated if one looks at the situation which would havearisen had the plaintiff company decided, after the trial of the action, not to go with any building scheme at all. Assuming thischange of plan had been equally unconnected with the holding over as was the 24 storey scheme it seems very unlikely that they wouldever have sought damages on the basis of what had not occurred. It seems obvious that the reason they have done so is because a buildingeventually was built on the site to replace the existing properties. Yet the damage done to the 16 storey scheme by the holding overis no less illusory in the context of a new but wholly different building then it would be in the context of no new building at all.Damages on the grounds they are looked for here cannot easily be fitting into any of the usual categories. They are neither past,continuing nor prospective. They might best be described as wholly suppositious.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Cheung argued that I should not be inhibited merely by the fact that I was asked to deal with a notional building. He said thateven if the 16 storey building had been completed, the Deputy Registrar, in coming to his task, would, in any event, have been dealingwith a notional building since the period which would have been vital to his assessment would have been the 6 month period duringwhich a rentable 16 storey building should have stood upon the plot and had not done so because of the holding over. There shouldtherefore, he says, be little more difficult in estimating the value of such a building for such a period now. But the differenceis that in the former case he would have been dealing with a real building. All that would have been notional would have been thetime of its completion. Not only would the building have been real but the condition of the market relevant to the assessment, thoughdealing with time elapsed, would also have been real. This second reality remains but it is on its own, insufficient to give fleshto the national ghost of a building which was never completed because it was never started. In the entire history of the redevelopmentof this plot of land the only factor arising from the holding over which remains common to both schemes and relevant to the abandonedscheme is that the plot itself was withheld from its rightful owners. For this withholding the defendants have already paid in mesneprofits. The further foreseeable loss which the plaintiff company claims as deriving from the defendants' wrongful act could onlyaccrue if that which had been foreseen had also come to pass.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The true reason why this appeal must fail that is there was on the facts placed before the Deputy Registrar nothing upon which hemight legitimately implement the direction of the trial judge. The separate and cognate considerations as to mitigation, remotenessand res inter alios acta do not therefore fall to be considered since my finding is that there is wanting upon the facts as theynow appear any degree of damage such as might have necessitated resort to those considerations.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It is true, of course, that had the plaintiff company alleged and proved that the abandonment of the earlier scheme was the resultof the defendants holding over, it might reasonably have claimed the consequential loss irrespective of whether it had abandonedevery scheme or else completed a different building. In the latter case the company would, of course, have needed to show that thecompleted building was, on other grounds, res inter alios or else be compelles to bring the profits of it into account.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I am indebted to counsel for very full arguments which ranged over a wider spectrum of topics than I have covered in this judgment.If I have not referred to the greater part of the cases cited to me and upon which counsel sought to rely it is not through wantrespect either for those authorities or for the arguments in which they were deployed. None of those authorities however was addressedto the point which seems to me to be the decisive one and upon which I have concluded the appeal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The plaintiff company was the appellant in this case and in effect, as Mr. Zimmern said that the outset, the respondent was cross-appealingagainst the Deputy Registrar. Accordingly I dismiss the plaintiff company's appeal and allow the cross-appeal. The order for nominaldamage in the sum of $1 is set aside and the defendants, the respondents in this appeal, will have the costs of the appeal and alsothe costs of the hearing before the Deputy Registrar.
