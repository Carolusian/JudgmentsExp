He now appeals against thatorder. The <u>only</u> ground of appeal is set out in his notice of appeal as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Even though 15 driving-offences points have been accumulated by his fixed penalty offences, the appellant should not be disqualifiedunder S.8 of the Road Traffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/375">Cap.375</a> after he has duly paid in accordance with the fixed penaltyticket (i.e. liability for the offence can be discharged by presenting this notice ..... and pay the fixed penalty within 21 days..... ) in the light of Rule (6) of Article 11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ord."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Mr Watson, who appears for the appellant, argues that the appellant should not be punished twice. It is his contention that the RoadTraffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance has been wholly repealed by s.3(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Articles 10 and11 thereof. The right for a licence to drive a motor vehicle on a public road is a valuable right and may only be taken away by dueprocess of law. The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240" class="autolink_findacts">Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(8)</a> provides that where a person has paid the fixed penalty "he shall not be liable to be <u>prosecuted or convicted</u> for the scheduled offence specified in the notice". This is a clear and unequivocal statement that no further consequences shallflow in respect of that offence. All liability is extinguished. The Road Traffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/375">Cap.375</a>, s.4(1)provides that subject to s.6(2), where a person - (a) is convicted of a scheduled offence; or (b) becomes Liable to a fixed penaltyin respect of a scheduled offence, he shall incur the appropriate number of points in respect of that offence. Section 8 providesfor disqualification where 15 or more points have been incurred within two years.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr Watson submits that s.4 violates the Bill of Rights and is repealed by it. S.4 (1) (a) (i.e. the incurring of points when a personis convicted of a scheduled offence) though not directly in point in this appeal, is "illuminative in that on the face of it it directlycontravenes Article 11(6) of the Bill of Rights by authorising an offender to be punished again for an offence for which he has alreadybeen finally convicted in imposing penalty points that lead to disqualification." It is true, says Mr Watson, that S.4(1) (b) (whichis directly in point in this appeal) is not caught by Article 11 as a person paying a fixed penalty is not liable to be prosecutedor convicted, but this is absurd and in a true and liberal interpretation of the Article, a person who is not liable to prosecutionand conviction should not be placed in a more disadvantageous position than a convict. He submits that the greater includes the lesserand on a true construction a person not liable to prosecution and conviction must not be punished at all.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Mr Watson points out that it was submitted by the Crown and apparently accepted by the learned magistrate that the imposition ofpoints leading to disqualification by a purely executive act is not punishment but a consequence of proceedings civil in nature.If this be true, despite being in consequence of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240" class="autolink_findacts">Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance</a>, then the whole purpose of the Bill of Rights could be avoided by, e.g. calling a flogging or penal incarceration a civil administrativecorrection or some such term. He submits that the word "punished" means in respect of a person, the deprivation of a right he wouldotherwise enjoy as a citizen.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Mr Watson refers to Article 10 of the Bill of Rights entitled "Equality before court and right to fair and public hearing". Thisstates "All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or ofhis rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independentand impartial tribunal established by law."</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr Watson submits that this article is breached by the Road Traffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance in that it permits the awardof penalty points leading to a penal sanction of criminal punishment (disqualification and deprivation of a right or licence) andat civil law (similarly) by the imposition of the executive without the intervention of a court or tribunal. He submits that it appearsto be repugnant to common sense, law and justice that a person solemnly assured by statute that he should not be prosecuted or convictedfor an alleged offence and his liability will be discharged on the payment of a sum by way of penalty, should suffer further punishment/civildisability without at least being informed, e.g. by endorsment on the Fixed Penalty Notice.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Miss Yasmin Mahomed, Crown Counsel, appearing for the respondent, submits that the appellant does not get disqualified for six monthsby way of executive action. There is a competent tribunal. He is summoned to go before the magistrate. He is therefore able to havehis say. This is in accordance with s.10. With regard to the fixed penalty ticket, he can decide not to pay and elect to go to court.He can plead not guity or plead guilty, it is his choice. The disqualification is a civil consequence arising from having 15 points.She relies on the Crown's skeleton submission which had been tendered before the magistrate by Senior Assistant Crown ProsecutorMr S.R. Bailey, which is in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"<u>THE ISSUES</u></p>            <p class="quote">    The issue is whether an order of disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under Section 8 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/375">Cap.375</a> (by reasonof a person accumulating 15 or more points within a relevant 2 year period) is inconsistent with Article 11(6) BOR by reason of amountingto 'double punishment' for an offence - and if so, the effect of such inconsistency under Section 3 of the BOR.</p>            <p class="quote"><u>Elements of Article 11(6) BOR</u></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">2.

Article 11(6) BOR protects a person against trial or punishment again for 'an offence for which he has already been finallyconvicted or acquitted'. Article 11(6) BOR recognises the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. In the case of a personwho pays the amount demanded on a fixed penalty notice, there is no offence for which he has been 'convicted'. Section 3(8) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240">Cap.240</a>specifically provides that a person who pays the full amount of a fixed penalty notice '... shall not be liable to be prosecutedor convicted for the scheduled offence specified in the notice'.

Even if a person who is liable to disqualification under Section 8 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/375">Cap.375</a> was treated as if he had been convicted of offences,the reference in Article 11(6) BOR to '<u>finally</u> convicted' recognises that a single act may have multiple penal consequences. Disqualification does not flow from any single drivingoffence but from the accumulation of 15 points within a 2 year period. This is a quite separate issue from the penalties imposedfor individual driving offences. The offender is subject to disqualification for repeated violations of the traffic laws within alimited (2 year) period. The essence of the disqualification is a civil sanction for misconduct over an extended period.</p>            <p class="quote">9.

In I fact there is only one ground of appeal and that is that the disqualificationof the appellant under s.8 of the Road Traffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/375">Cap.375</a> must be considered as having been repealedas being inconsistent with Article 11 para.6 of the Bill of Rights Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In my judgment, there is nothing in the Road Traffic (Driving Offence Points) Ordinance which is inconsistent with Article 11 para.6.This Ordinance is concerned with road safety and with the protection of the public from drivers who have shown by their conduct thatthey provide a potential danger, to members of the public.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In the first place, he has not been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of Hong Kong. The<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240" class="autolink_findacts">Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance</a> provides a way in which a person can, by paying the full amount of a fixed penalty, render himself not liable to be prosecuted orconvicted for a scheduled offence.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> However, that does not mean to say that he has not committed an offence. The whole basis of proceedings under this Ordinance is predicatedupon the commission of a scheduled offence. The payment by him of a fixed penalty is indicative of the fact that he does not disputehaving committed the offence. By so paying, he is not liable to be prosecuted or convicted for the scheduled defence. There are thustwo ways in which a person may be punished for a scheduled offence. Either by prosecution and conviction and subsequent sentence,or by the proceedings under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/240" class="autolink_findacts">Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance</a>, <u>where he pays the fixed Penalty</u>.

Stevenson J.A. held that the distinction between a criminal or quasi-criminal proceedingand a regular tort proceeding was whether the object of the legislation was to punish for the commission of the prohibited act orto protect the public by the regulation of future conduct. Where the real object of the legislation is the protection of the publicby a scheme for regulating the future conduct of individuals who have committed past infractions, the proceedings does not come withinthe protection s.11 although the effect may be punitive."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> If principles in the Canadian cases were to be followed in Hong Kong, clearly a disqualification should not be considered a punishment.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In my judgment disqualification is not a punishment but a civil consequence of an offence.
