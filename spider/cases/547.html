The Plaintiffsare opposing the application. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Under the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's summons, it is apparent that the application is purportedly made under Order 12 rule 8 of the Rules of District Court. Mr. Kerry, representing the Plaintiffs, argued that Order 12 rule 8 has no application, for an application for a stay of proceedingsto a foreign court ought to be made pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr. Wright, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, informed the Court at the hearing that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is not taking any issue under Order 12 rule 8 of the Rules of the District Court.  Therefore, whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts is not in issue in the present application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b><u>Background</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, Zhoushan Xinhong Aquatic Co. Ltd., was the shipper of a cargo of frozen seafood ("the cargo"); the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was the receiver of the cargo.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff shipped the cargo by sea from the port of Ningbo to the port of Nagoya on board the vessel Xiang Xing ("the vessel") undera contract of carriage contained or evidenced in a bill of lading number 8NGBNG03A5975 dated 27<sup>th</sup> August 2005 issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the carrier ("the said Bill of Lading").</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Upon delivery to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, the cargo was found to be damaged; there was evidence that it had defrosted during the course of carriage from Ningboto Nagoya.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is the Plaintiff's case that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the cargo.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant being liable in contract, tort and bailment; the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant  to whom the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant delegated or subcontracted its obligations under the said Bill of Lading is liable in tort and/or bailment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The writ in these proceedings was served on both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants in Hong Kong on 8<sup>th</sup> February 2006.  Service was acknowledged by both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and both filed notice of intention to defend.  The Plaintiff's Statement of Claim was served on 27<sup>th</sup> February 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  By a consent summons on 30<sup>th</sup> March 2006, time for service of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's Defence was extended to 10<sup>th</sup> April 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant applied for a stay on 7<sup>th</sup> April 2006.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not challenge the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Courts and filed a defence on 26<sup>th</sup> April 2006.  The Writ and Statement of Claim were amended on 29<sup>th</sup> May 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  According to the Writ, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff's address is at Zhoushan in the province of Zhejiang in the PRC whereas the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff's address is at Shimonoseki, Japan.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff  appears to be a PRC company and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff a Japanese company.  On the other hand, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has an address at Great Eagle Centre, Harbour Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong. Mr. Wright, however, submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is in fact a PRC company.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is a company incorporated in Hong Kong and has an address at 99 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong.  Mr. Wright, referredto the annual return of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, which indicated that a PRC company, China Shipping Container Lines Co. Ltd. with an address in Shanghai is the holderof 999,999 shares of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and 4 out of 5 of its directors are located in Shanghai in the PRC.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant relied on the contractual jurisdiction provision allegedly written on the reverse side or the back of the said Bill ofLading.  The Plaintiff disputed the alleged terms to have formed part of the contract of carriage.  It is the Plaintiff's case thatthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant failed to exhibit the said Bill of Lading and the reverse side of the said Bill of Lading with the terms containing thealleged jurisdiction and applicable law provision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr. Wright admitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has not been able to produce either a copy or the original of the said Bill of Lading for the particular cargo in question.The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant claimed the terms and conditions on the back of the said Bill of Lading are identical to those referred to in paragraph7 of Mr. Yang Yuntao's 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation and exhibit "YYT-6" of Mr Yang's 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant produced at the hearing a similar bill of lading form with terms and conditions appearing on the reverse side.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr. Kerry, representing the two Plaintiffs in this application, took strong objection to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's failure to produce a copy of the original Bill of Lading with the terms set out on the back.  Mr. Wright admitted thatthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had not in its possession a copy of the original Bill of Lading.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Kerry submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had retained only a photo or fax copy of the front of the said Bill of Lading and the original Bill of Lading had beensent to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff had never received or seen a copy of the said original Billing of Lading with the alleged terms and conditions on the back. This was said to be an accepted trade practice where the cargo was released by telex.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The absence of the said Bill of Lading is unfortunate.  If the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is relying on the terms of the contract (the bill of lading), it has to discharge the onus of proof by producing the saidBill of Lading with the terms and conditions binding on the parties.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant cannot rely on a clause in the contract that has not been proved to exist.  It is not beyond the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to locate a copy of the said Bill of Lading with the terms and conditions printed on the reverse side.  As the Plaintiffsmade no admission to the terms forming part of the said Bill of Lading, the burden is on the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to show that the alleged terms formed part of the contract between the two Plaintiffs and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The Foreign Jurisdiction Clause</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Had the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant succeeded in proving the alleged foreign jurisdiction clause was one of the terms on the reverse side of the said Billof Lading and binding on the Plaintiffs, this clause would be significant in the determination of whether these proceedings shouldbe stayed in favour of an action against the carrier to be brought before the Maritime Court of Ningbo in the People's Republic ofChina.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Applicable Legal Principles</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In the event the Plaintiffs are pursuing a claim in Hong Kong in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the Hong Kong Courtcan exercise its discretion to refuse a stay provided strong cause is shown by the Plaintiffs.  The Court's discretion in refusinga stay is subject to the principles established by a line of authorities referred to by Brandon L.J. in the case of The "El Amria"[1981] Lloyd's Law Reports vol.2 119 at p.123-124.  The Court has to consider all of the circumstances of the case, taking into accountthe following factors summarised by Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws 13<sup>th</sup> edition volume 1 page 443 paragraph 12-117:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">"In exercising its discretion whether or not to grant a stay, the court considers all the circumstances of the case, and the followingformulation of the particular factors to be taken into account has been much relied upon: (1) in which country the evidence is available,and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of a trial in England or abroad; (2) whether the contract is governedby the law of the foreign country in question, and if so, whether it differs from English law in any material respect; (3) with whatcountry either party is connected, and how closely; (4) whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in a foreign country, or areonly seeking procedural advantages; (5) whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court becausethey would be deprived of security for their claim, or be unable to enforce the judgment in their favour, or be faced with a time-barnot applicable in England, or for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.  The fact that astay will result in concurrent proceedings with different parties, but similar issues, may militate against a stay." </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The aforesaid factors have been approved by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Trafalgar House Construction (Asia) Ltd. v.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the actual carrier.  The Plaintiffs claimed it owed a duty to the Plaintiffs for the damage to the cargo that tookplace while the cargo was in its custody. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In spite of a Surveyor's report prepared on the instructions of the Plaintiffs, the exact cause and time of the damage to the cargohas yet to be established.  The Plaintiffs, however, put the blame on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and concluded that the damage arose as a result of defects in or the malfunctioning of the container or the interruptionof electricity supply while the cargo was carried by the Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiffs claimed that as the shipper and the consignee they have suffered damages and have the right to sue.  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as the carrier and the sub-bailee are therefore liable, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under the contract of carriage and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the sub-bailee in bailment and tort.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is not disputed that the main issue for determination at the trial would be the cause of damage to the cargo.  The burden ofproof is on the Plaintiffs to show the Defendants are liable. The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff would be expected to prove the condition of the cargo at the time of delivery to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's custody in Ningbo.   Such evidence must come from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff's servants or agents in Ningpo.  As to the evidence on the discovery of the damage at the time of delivery to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in Nagoya, evidence would come from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff's agents or servants in Nagoya in Japan.    The investigators who made enquiries in Ningbo and prepared a report in Englishon the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff's instruction would also be giving evidence at the trial. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is not disputed that that both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' witnesses would have to come to Hong Kong from China to give evidence if the trial is conducted in Hong Kong. Consequently,the evidence at the trial would come from witnesses resident in China and in Japan.  The only connection with Hong Kong is the factthat both Defendants have an address in Hong Kong.  However, even though the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong, the cargo was carried from the port of Ningbo in China to the port of Nagoya in Japan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Kerry argued that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant being a Hong Kong incorporated company should be able to give evidence in Hong Kong with no difficulties and it is withinthe power of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to call its servants or agents to prove the condition of the cargo while the cargo was in its custody throughout the periodof the carriage.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There is obvious advantage for the trial to be conducted in English because all the documents are in written in English, includingthe report of the surveyor appointed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in Japan.  However, the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff's agents or servants and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' witnesses would presumably have to come from Ningbo</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  There are no language difficulties if the case is tried in Hong Kong because the Hong Kong Courts have excellent interpretationfacilities.  So far as costs and expenses of the trial are concerned, the surveyor/investigators from Japan have to travel to thecity where the trial is conducted whether it be Hong Kong or Ningpo in any event.  The witnesses from Ningbo, however, would haveto travel to Hong Kong if these proceedings are allowed to continue.   Mr Kerry submitted that should the Plaintiffs be requiredto take up further proceedings in the PRC they would be exposed to further delay and incur additional expenses and costs.  Furthermore,all the documents written in English would have to be translated into Chinese.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The Applicable Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  If the alleged Clause 4 formed part of the contract of carriage, the applicable law under Clause 4 is the law of the People's Republicof China.  Since the alleged Clause 4 also stated that any dispute arising should be brought in the Maritime Court of the PRC, thereis no doubt that the Maritime Court in China would be the appropriate Court to take up this matter and apply the law of the People'sRepublic of China instead of a common law jurisdiction Court in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The Country the Parties is More Closely Connected</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Of the four parties involved, three are said to be closely connected to the PRC.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is incorporated in Hong Kong with its major shareholder, a company registered in Shanghai.  The only exception is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, which is based in Japan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Genuinely Desire For Trial in Hong Kong</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  There is no evidence that the Plaintiffs are merely seeking procedural advantage in commencing proceedings in Hong Kong.  The Plaintiffs,however, claimed that they would be disadvantaged should they commence proceedings in the PRC because of enforcement difficultiesof a PRC judgment on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, a company incorporated in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Prejudice</u> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr. Kerry referred to the possibility of multiple proceedings if these proceedings are stayed. The 2nd Defendant being a companyincorporated in Hong Kong, there is possible difficulties involved in the enforcement of a judgment from the Maritime Court in Ningboagainst the 2nd Defendant. Consequently, the Plaintiffs would have to continue with the present proceedings against 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in Hong Kong in any event.  Furthermore, there is a risk that the Courts in Ningpo and Hong Kong may differ in their respectivefindings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  These are genuine concerns.    On the basis that 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant can show the parties had chosen the governing law of the contract to be the law of the People's Republic of China, thePlaintiffs would have to show a very strong case to resist a stay of these proceedings in breach of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.In paragraph 27 of Mr. Yang's 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation, Mr Yang claimed that under article 257 of the Chinese Maritime Code (page 120 of the bundle), the limitation periodfor claims against the carrier with regard to the carriage of goods by sea is one year.  He believed the Plaintiffs' claim againstthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had not been time-barred in the PRC until the expiry of one year after the cargo was delivered to the consignee's premiseson 6<sup>th</sup> September 2005.  That indeed should be the position if not for Clause 24 of the alleged terms of the said Bill of Lading which stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">" </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">24.

The Plaintiffs consequently should notbe exposed to the risk to have their claims thrown out by the Chinese Maritime Court under Clause 24 because it was not brought within9 months of 9<sup>th</sup> September 2005.  As no expert opinion from a Chinese law expert on the applicable principles between the terms in the contract ofcarriage that conflicted with an article in the Chinese Maritime Code had been produced at the hearing, the Hong Kong Court wouldadopt an interpretation according to the local law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I find there is a genuine risk that the Plaintiffs may be put in the position similar to the case of The "Blue Wave" [1982] volume1 Lloyd's Law Reports, part II, page 151 where Sheen J. held at page 153:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">"At the time when this contract was made it was made between the cargo-owners and the shipowners, who were identified under cl. 17of the bill of lading as "the carrier".  I have no doubt that the proper law of the contract is the law of the country in which theshipowners have their principal place of business." </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">43. Sheen J. held that the defendants have a place of business in Piraeus.  They have no office or staff in Liberia.  The "Blue Wave"did not operate from Liberia.  There can therefore be no doubt that the defendants have their principal place of business in Greece.He further found that as between the original parties to the contract of the carriage there was an agreement that any dispute arisingthereunder would be decided in the Courts of Greece.  He held that the Court would give effect to the agreement by granting a stayof proceedings unless the Plaintiffs can show strong grounds for not doing so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  At page 156 of the report he held further:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">"The approach of the Courts of this country to a time bar has significantly altered in recent years.  If it is open to a Court toextend the time limit, the Court will look to see if the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay in commencing proceedings.  Suchprejudice cannot arise where a claim is brought in time, but not in the correct tribunal.  There would be an injustice to a plaintiff,who has suffered a legal wrong and has started proceedings, if he is precluded altogether from pursuing his remedy.  The fact thatthe plaintiff will have no remedy in the foreign Court seems to me to be a powerful factor against a stay." </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  At page 157, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote">"It seems to me that I have two options.  I can refuse to stay the action in England, or I can grant a stay conditional upon the defendantsnot taking the time bar point in Greece.  Thereafter, if the Court takes the point of its own motion I could treat that as groundsfor lifting the stay.  On the evidence before me, it seems that if I were to adopt the second option I might be putting the partiesto a great deal of unnecessary expense and I might cause delay in the resolution of this dispute.  I have already indicated my viewthat on the facts of this case, when considering only the convenience to the parties as between litigation in Athens and litigationin London, there is very little to choose between the two possible venues.  On that basis, it would be quite wrong to stay proceedingsin London and thereby put the parties to the expense, inconvenience and delay which would result from starting again in Athens ifthere is a possibility that the matter would have to come back to London because the claim in Greece is time barred." </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The same principles have been referred to in Fuad J.'s judgment in the Hong Kong Cases of <i>Confecciones Del Atlantico v Lamont Shipping Incorporated  </i>[1982] Hong Kong Cases 327, where the learned judge adopted the principles set out in The "Eleftheria"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20P%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] P 94</a> and the influence of the time bar factor on the Court in Sheen J.'s judgment at p. 156 referred to above.  The 'multiplicity of proceedings'point was held to be in the plaintiffs' favour.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusions</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Should the present proceedings be stayed for the Plaintiffs to pursue their claims in the Maritime Court of Ningbo and should theDefendants raise the issue of limitation of action under the contract in the PRC Court relying on Clause 24 of the alleged termsand conditions on the back of the said Bill of Lading, it is likely that the Plaintiffs would not be able to recover against theDefendants in the PRC.  As a result, the Plaintiffs would have to turn to the Hong Kong Courts and apply for the lifting of the stayof proceedings in Hong Kong after a long delay and having incurred further expenses in the Ningbo Maritime Court proceedings.  Itseems to me to be quite wrong to stay proceedings in Hong Kong and expose the Plaintiffs to the risks of wasting huge expenses andtime if there is a strong possibility that the matter may be time-barred in China under the alleged Clause 24 of the said Bill ofLading.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I come to the following conclusions after considering all of the circumstances of this case. Firstly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had failed to produce a copy or the original of the said Bill of Lading with the terms attached to establish its claimthat the parties are subject to a binding exclusive jurisdiction clause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Secondly, even if the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is able to establish that the Plaintiffs are bound by a foreign jurisdiction clause in the contract, there is a strongpossibility that the Maritime Court in Ningpo may reject the Plaintiffs' claims upon finding the Plaintiffs to be bound by Clause24 of the alleged terms and conditions, the Plaintiffs having failed to bring their claims against the Defendants within 9 monthsof the delivery of the cargo.  The period of 9 months having expired on 8 June 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Thirdly, the Plaintiffs would have to face multiplicity of proceedings and put to great expense to commence proceedings in the MaritimeCourt in Ningbo which may be an exercise in futility due to Clause 24; resulting in their return to Hong Kong to pursue their claimsagainst the Defendants. Further, they may have to continue their claims against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in any event, even if they should succeed in the Maritime Court in Ningpo in order to enforce the judgment.  For the aforesaidreasons, I am satisfied the Plaintiffs have shown a strong cause for not granting a stay of these proceedings.   The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's application to stay is, therefore, dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Cost nisi â Cost should follow the event therefore the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should pay the cost of the Plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(H.C.
