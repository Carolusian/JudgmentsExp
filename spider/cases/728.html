As between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (âD3â) (a logistics company providing crane lorry and operator service and the registered owner of the Vehicle in paragraph2 below) and AXA General Insurance Hong Kong Limited as Third Party (âAXAâ or âTPâ), there is no dispute that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  at the material time (i) the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (âD2â) was the principal contractor of the works at a construction site at Lantau Power Station (âSiteâ), and (ii)D1 and D3 were sub-contractors of D2 [1];</p>        <p>(b)  AXA was the public liability insurer concerned in respect of the Site, and Wing Lung Insurance Company Limited (âWing Lungâ)was the employeesâ compensation (âECâ) insurer concerned for D1, D2 and D3 (collectively, âDsâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>II.

The Vehicle lifted up the mini-lorry, and as P was leaving from underneath after adjusting a sling, the mini-lorry fell down onhim causing him to suffer personal injuries (âAccidentâ).  P further claims that the Accident was caused by (a) default on thepart of D1 as Pâs employer and/or on the part of D3 as the Vehicleâs operator, and/or (b) breach of duty as occupier(s) of theSite on the part of D1 and/or D2 and/or their servants/agents.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Ds deny liability and aver that the Accident was solely caused by or contributed to by Pâs negligence.

THIRD PARTY PROCEEDINGS</i></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  D3 commenced third party proceedings against TP in 2009 on the basis that if it were adjudged to be liable to P, it would be entitledto an indemnity or contribution from TP pursuant to the Policy in respect of loss/damages claimed by P.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  D3 notes that P alleges the Accident was caused by default on the part of D3 as the Vehicleâs operator, and argues that if liabilityattaches to D3 (as D2âs insured sub-contractor under the Policy) towards P (as an employee of D1 being another of D2âs insuredsub-contractors under the Policy), TP as insurer shall be liable under the Policy to indemnify D3 in respect of all sums which D3shall become legally liable to pay in respect of loss and damages consequential upon personal injuries suffered by P as a resultof the Accident (âD3âs Liabilityâ).

WL argued that since the Proviso drew adistinction between âany subcontractor insured under this Policyâ and âany other subcontractorâ, the proper constructionof the Exclusion Clause meant the Policy only covered personal injuries suffered by employees of uninsured sub-contractors as a resultof the liability of insured sub-contractors.  Since (a) P was employed by D1, (b) D1 was a sub-contractor of D2, (c) D2 sub-sub-contractedthe transportation of the mini-lorry to D3, and (d) all Ds were insured sub-contractors, WL argued that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[in] the circumstances, this is a claim by a worker of insured subcontractor for personal injuries against the liability of insuredsubcontractors.</p>        <p class="quote">The claim therefore falls outside the [Proviso] of the [Exclusion Clause] of [AXAâs] Policy.

WKT claimed such constructionâis not something physically or realistically possible in any real senseâ and was misconceived, and the phrase âany other subcontractorâin the Proviso meant the Policy in fact covered liability of all sub-contractors of any tier regarding their performance on the Site.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 2 April 2009, WKT on behalf of D3 wrote to WL âin connection with [AXAâs] liability vis-<span style="font-family:Symbol;">Ã </span>-vis [D3] under the Policyâ to state that â[WLâs] earlier letter for repudiating liability under the Policy is noted but rejectedâ.WKT reiterated that WLâs interpretation of the Exclusion Clause was misconceived, and urged AXA to reconsider taking over D3âsdefence, failing which D3 might commence arbitration proceedings against AXA.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On 14 April 2009, WL replied by reiterating AXAâs stance and stating that the Proviso was inapplicable to the present claim.

On 25 May 2009, not having received any reply, WL on behalf of AXA filedthe AS giving notice of intention to defend.  The filed AS was marked âINSIST ON FILING without 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Notice filing recordâ.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  On 3 June 2009, D2 faxed to WKT copies of the AS and correspondence from Pâs solicitors, including a letter to D3 dated 1 June2009 enquiring whether D3 had engaged any legal representative to act for them in the present proceedings.

Therefore, the [AS] before [the third party notice] was issued (and not just not served) is clearly invalid anda nullityâ.  Ms Lum further claims that without any third party notice issued out of the court registry and when there were infact no third party proceedings at the time, the AS filed by WL on behalf of AXA as the purported Third Party before any third partynotice was properly issued âwas irregular, invalid and a nullityâ.  Ms Lum went on to say that â[in] fact, the Third Partyproceedings were issued <i>on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants</i> only on 23 July 2009â (my emphasis), but since TP/WL failed to acknowledge service of the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN or respond to WKTâs letter to TP dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 32 above), it was then unclear whether WL still actedfor TP.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On 2 December 2009, WL filed Mr Kwongâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation in opposition.

Mr Kwongâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation asserts <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   with no reply to WLâs letter dated 23 May 2009 (see paragraph 28 above) from the High Court, D3 and/or WKT, WL filed the ASso as to protect AXA from any default judgment being entered in the absence of notice of intention to defend;</p>        <p>(b)   the third party proceedings could not have been issued on behalf of Ds since the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> TPNs were respectively signed by D3 (without legal representation) and by WKT on behalf of D3, consequently D1 and D2 had no <i>locus standi</i> to take out the AS Summons;</p>        <p>(c)    having already filed the AS, TP could not file any further acknowledgment of service to the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, but it was evident from the AS that TP intended to contest the third party claim;</p>        <p>(d)   the confusion (if any) was caused by D3 who served two sets of third party notices on TP, and also by WKT in failing to respondto WLâs letter dated 23 May 2009 (see paragraph 28 above).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  At the hearing of the AS Summons on 8 December 2009, I granted leave to D3 to amend such summons by removing all references to D1and D2 having issued the application.

It is only in plain and obvious cases that the court should exercise its summary powers to strike out the indorsement ofany writ or any pleading under this rule.

Nor should the court decide difficult points of law in striking out proceedings. The claim must beobviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed beforethe court will strike it out. â¦â¦ Where the legal viability of a cause of action is sensitive to the facts, an order to strikeout should not be made â¦â¦ The mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">It is for the party seeking to strike out an indorsement on a writ or pleading to demonstrate that the case is a plain and obviousone in which the other partyâs claim is bound to fail. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It is fair to say that TP essentially relies on the contractual limitation defence in Condition 10(e) in its application to strikeout D3âs third party claim.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  <i>Kanson Crane Service Company Limited v Bank of China Group Insurance Company Limited</i> HCA 4246/2002, Deputy High Court Judge Lam (as he then was) (unreported, 1 August 2003) is concerned with a similar limitation clausein a contractorsâ plant and machinery insurance policy which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the event of the Insurers disclaiming liability in respect of any claim and if an action or suit is not commenced within threemonths after such disclaimer â¦â¦ all benefit under this Policy in respect of such claim shall be forfeited.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned judge held that where it was clear that a defendant relied on a limitation defence and the plaintiff could not overcomesuch plea, the court could strike out the claim on the basis that it was frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of thecourt.

An insurance contract is a contract for indemnity.  It is a commercial transaction and an insurer is entitled to offersuch indemnity solely on the basis of the terms and conditions set out in the policy.  Hence, in the present case, under Condition1, it is stipulated that the due observance and fulfillment of the terms of the Policy by the Plaintiff is a condition precedentto the liability of the insurer.  The Limitation Clause is one of the terms of the Policy.

CONDITION 10(e)</i></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  First of all, it is permissible in insurance, as in other forms of contract, for the parties to agree to a shorter limitation period,and such limitation clause is effective to defeat a claim by the assured outside the agreed limitation period [2].  Secondly, Condition10(e) as a limitation clause should be construed strictly and <i>contra proferentum</i> against TP, but âif the court reaches a conclusion on the proper construction of an exemption clause which have sweeping effects,it has no power to rewrite the contract for the partiesâ [3].</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In order to raise a successful contractual limitation defence under Condition 10(e) and to strike out D3âs claim, TP has to clearlysatisfy the following elements: (a) âthe claim be made and rejectedâ and (b) âan action or suit be not commenced within threemonths after such rejectionâ.

But such policy coverage is subject to exclusions [4]. The Exclusion Clause states thatTP will not be liable for personal injury suffered by any person employed by âan insured Contractor â¦â¦â, but the Provisoprevents the application of such exclusion to any liability that may attach to âany subcontractor insuredâ under the Policy inrespect of personal injuries suffered by a person employed by âany subcontractorâ.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  TP contends that because P was an employee of D1 (being an insured sub-contractor), the Exclusion Clause excludes D3âs Liabilityfrom the policy coverage, and the Proviso is insufficient to restore such liability back within the indemnity provision.  TP claimsthat the distinction between âany subcontractor insuredâ and âany subcontractorâ in the Proviso means that the latter necessarilyrefers to an uninsured sub-contractor, so that the Proviso only captures and brings back within the policy coverage any liabilitycaused by insured sub-contractors in respect of personal injuries suffered by employees of uninsured sub-contractors.  Since D3âsLiability relates to an employee (ie P) of an insured sub-contractor (ie D1), the Proviso is not applicable and consequently theExclusion Clause excludes such liability from the policy coverage.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the other hand, D3 contends that the reference to âan insured Contractorâ in the Exclusion Clause means that the exclusionis limited to liability that an insured sub-contractor may owe towards his own employee.  Since P was employed by D1 and not D3 (bothof whom are insured sub-contractors), the Exclusion Clause (and hence the Proviso) does not apply.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Cheung, counsel for TP, has not cited any authority in support of TPâs proposition, but Mr Sakhrani refers to <i>Dragages et Travaux Publics (HK) Limited and Penta-Ocean</i> <i>Construction Company Limited t/a âDragages â Penta Joint Ventureâ v RJ Wallace &amp; ors</i> HCMP 6577/2001, A Cheung J (unreported, 27 February 2004). In that case, the contractorsâ all risk and third party liability insurancepolicy for the benefit of the principal contractor, the government and all contractors engaged to provide goods and services in connectionwith the contract project, including the plaintiffs, contained indemnity and exclusion provisions similar to those in the Policyin the present case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Insurers will indemnify the Insured â¦â¦ in respect of all sums which the Insured shall become legally liable to pay arisingout of the performance of the Insureds projects described in the Schedule for:-</p>        <p class="quote">i) death, bodily injury, personal injury (excluding illness) to or disease contracted by any person</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">occurring during the Period of Insurance and arising out of or in connection with the Insured Project as shown in the Schedule.</p>        <p class="quote">Provided always that the indemnity granted by this Policy shall not apply to nor include:-</p>        <p class="quote">1.  Liability in respect of death of or bodily injury (including illness) to any person under a contract of employment or apprenticeshipwith the Insured Party and arising out of and in the course of such personâs employment or service with such Insured party.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The learned judge held that although âthe Insuredâ covers a number of parties, when the exclusion and indemnity provisions wereread together, âthe Insuredâ and âInsured partyâ referred to the particular insured who was making a claim for indemnityunder the policy:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is this particular insured entity who has incurred a <i>liability</i>, in respect of which it is seeking indemnity under the policy. It makes its claim under the indemnity provisions in the policy. Theexclusion provisions in the policy are then looked at to see whether the claim is excluded. Viewed in that way, as a matter of construction,it would seem to me that the insured party in exclusion 1 must be a reference to the insured entity who has incurred a liabilityand who is seeking indemnity under the policy.â (see para.25)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Such construction was made stronger by the cross-liability and waiver provisions in the policy (which provisions were similar to theCross Liability Clause in the Policy in the present case) and accorded much better with the commercial reality or factual matrixof the policy in question.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I accept that whilst case law is helpful and the above authority lends weight to D3âs contention, ultimately the Policy must beconstrued as a whole according to its own wording and factual matrix.  But for the present purpose, it is not necessary to determinewhether D3âs construction of the Exclusion Clause and the Proviso is correct or not. In a strike out application, I am preparedto take D3âs case to its highest, and assume its contention that D3âs Liability falls within the Coverage Clause and outsidethe Exclusion Clause is the correct one (âAssumptionâ).  Under such construction, any liability that may attach to D3 in respectof personal injuries suffered by employees in its direct employ is excluded from the policy coverage and no doubt falls within thecoverage of the relevant EC insurance policy.  This means there will be double insurance under both policies in respect of any liabilitythat may attach to D3 for personal injuries suffered by employees of D2 and/or its other sub-contractors (eg D1).  However, â[double]insurance is not a vice, undesirable result or absurdity that a court in construing a policy should strive to avoidâ [5].</p>    <p><i>(d)  Repudiation of liability and/or rejection of claim?</i></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  On the above analysis, Mr Sakhrani submits that in rejecting âthis present claimâ on the basis that it is not liable to indemnifyand it will not take over the conduct of the defence of any of Ds on the grounds set out in paragraph 50 above (which D3 has neveraccepted), TP is not addressing D3âs claim as set out in paragraphs 51-53 above, which on the basis of the Assumption falls withinthe Coverage Clause but outside the Exclusion Clause.  This, in essence, is the apples and oranges analogy adopted by Mr Sakhraniin paragraph 48 above.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Cheung submits that whether D3âs or TPâs construction of the Exclusion Clause is correct or not is neitherhere nor here because in expressly declining to indemnify D3 under the Policy and in refusing to take over the conduct of D3âsdefence in the present proceedings TP has repudiated liability under the Policy.  D3âs simple proposition is that any repudiationof liability under the Policy comes within the meaning of âclaim â¦â¦ rejectedâ in Condition 10(e) irrespective of whethersuch repudiation is justified or wrongful.</p>    <p><i>(e)  Legal principles on repudiation</i></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In light of the above difference between counsel, it is necessary to revisit the principles of contractual repudiation.  NeitherMr Cheung nor Mr Sakhrani has cited any authority on this subject.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It is trite that repudiation refers to conduct that shows an intention not to fulfil the contract or to fulfil the contract onlyin a way that is substantially inconsistent with the partyâs obligations.  In my view, the test is an objective one, ie whetherthe conduct of the party in breach is such as to convey to a reasonable person in the shoes of the innocent party repudiation eitherof the contract as a whole or of a fundamental obligation under it.  Indeed, in the well-known case of <i>Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc (The Nanfri)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20AC%20757" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] AC 757</a>, 780, Lord Wilberforce said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf a partyâs conduct is such as to amount to a threatened repudiatory breach, his subjective desire to maintain the contractcannot prevent the other party from drawing the consequences of his action. The two cases relied on by the [buyers] â¦â¦ wouldonly be relevant here if the ownersâ action had been confined to asserting their own view â possibly erroneous â as to theeffect of the contract. They went, in fact, far beyond this when they threatened a breach of the contract with serious consequences.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  What matters is conduct and not state of mind of the party in breach.  It is irrelevant whether such party held an honest beliefthat his action was justified by the contract provisions or whether he acted in accordance with legal advice.  In <i>Haneet Chandru Vaswani v Italian Motor (Sales and Service) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 270</a>, 277, the Privy Council approved the following observations by Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal in <i>The Nanfri</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20QB%20927" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] QB 927</a>, 979:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI have yet to learn that a party who breaks a contract can excuse himself by saying that he did it on the advice of his lawyers;or that he was under an honest misapprehension â¦â¦ I would go by the principle â¦â¦ that if the partyâs [conduct] â objectivelyconsidered in its impact on the other party â is such as to evince an intention no longer to be bound by its contractual obligations,then it is open to the other party to accept his repudiation and treat the contract as discharged from that time onwards.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Case law in this area draws a distinction between a party asserting an erroneous interpretation of the contract and a breach ofcontract with serious consequences [6].  It was held in <i>Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd v Universal News Services Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20699" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 699</a> that it was not repudiation for a party merely to assert an erroneous interpretation of the contract.  Pearson LJ in that case notedthat the defendantsâ solicitors were stating their view as to the effect of the agreement âand said they were willing to performit, and they were not refusing to perform it according to its true construction, whatever that might beâ (p.734).  In <i>Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 277</a>, there was also no repudiation where on one side of the contract there was express reliance on a particular term and on the otherside there was an intention to seek judicial determination of the validity of a notice purportedly given under the contract.  Itwas assumed that both sides would abide by the decision of the court. Lord Wilberforce said at pp.282-283 that this was quite insufficientto support a case for repudiation.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Cheung JA summarised the distinction in <i>Creatiles Building Materials Co Ltd v Toâs Universe Construction Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 309</a>, 319, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe authors of <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (28th ed., 1999) Vol. 1, para. 25-018 commented that the cases in this area are not easy to reconcile. The position would appearto be that it may not be a repudiation for one party to put forward his genuine but <i>bona fide</i>, interpretation of what the contract requires of him but that <i>where that party performs in a manner which is not consistent with the terms of the contract</i>, it is no defence for that party to show that he acted in good faith.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  More recently in Australia, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, gave a more detailed summary of the distinctionas follows [7]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. For party A merely to assert, or argue for, a wrong interpretation of the contract will usually not be enough to justify partyB drawing an inference of repudiation. The reason for this is that party A may be willing to perform the contract according to itstenor. He may be willing to recognise his heresy once the true doctrine is enunciated or he may be willing to accept an authoritativeexposition of the correct interpretation. In either event an intention to repudiate the contract could not be attributed to him.Thus the inference of repudiation should not readily be drawn where, for example â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) party A makes âcontentious observations in the course of discussions or argumentsâ; or</p>        <p class="quote">(b) party Aâs conduct amounts to engaging in âa bona fide dispute as to the true construction of a contract expressed in termswhich are by no means clearâ.</p>        <p class="quote">2. The inference of repudiation can more readily be drawn when the interpretation relied on by party A is clearly or obviously untenableand party A â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) acts (or threatens to act) unilaterally on the basis of the interpretation; or</p>        <p class="quote">(b)     persists in the interpretation in the face of communications from party B pointing out the error.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><i>(f)  Repudiation (assumed to be wrongful)</i></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Here, the true question is what was conveyed to D3 by the position adopted by TP at the time.  WLâs letters dated 5 March and14 April 2009 to WKT insisted on TPâs construction of the Exclusion Clause (which for the present purpose is assumed to be erroneous),and made it plain that TP refused to provide indemnity to D3 under the Policy and/or to take over D3âs defence in the present proceedings(see paragraphs 19 and 23 above).  Thus, on the basis of the Assumption, TP has plainly performed in a manner not consistent withthe contractual terms of the Policy and has clearly persisted in an untenable or unjustifiable interpretation concerning its obligationsunder the Policy in face of WKTâs letters dated 5 and 12 March and 2 April 2009 that explain D3âs construction of the indemnityand exclusion provisions of the Policy and point out TPâs error (see paragraphs 19 and 21-22 above).  In my view, by adopting suchposition, TP has undoubtedly conveyed to D3 its determination to proceed in a manner that plainly amounts to a disclaimer of liabilityin respect of D3âs claim for indemnity under the Policy as well as a rejection of claim within the meaning of Condition 10(e).</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Although each case must turn on the particular conduct of the party in breach, it is useful to draw analogy from <i>Walker v Pennine Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1980] 2 Lloydâs Rep 156 [8], which concerned a motor insurance policy.  The agency through which the policy had been effectedwrote to the insured stating that the insurers considered the overcrowding of the car would have rendered the vehicle unroadworthy,so the insured was in breach of his policy conditions and the insurers decided not to proceed to meet the claim.  The insured disputedthis.  Whilst noting the insuredâs comments, the insurers were not prepared to reconsider their decision concerning indemnity,and such conduct was held to amount to a disclaimer of liability under the policy (at p.159).  There was a further letter from theinsurers returning the writ of summons served on the insured and stating they were unable to give attention to the claim on the insuredâsbehalf as they were not granting indemnity to him.  It was held that this was as much a disclaimer as the earlier letter.  âAccordingly,in [Roskill Jâs] judgment, there was here a plain disclaimer of liability for the claimâ (p.159).</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I am not persuaded that Mr Sakhraniâs reliance on the general principles concerning the form of notice of claim under an insurancepolicy is of assistance.  I accept that the notice must be in the form required by contract and the âcontents required dependson the contextâ [9].  But even if I further accept Mr Sakhraniâs submissions that such principles apply <i>a fortiori</i> to the form and contents of any notice of rejection of claim, I do not see how they detract from the principles on repduiatory conductdiscussed above.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Upon reaching the above conclusion that TP has repudiated liability to indemnify D3 under the Policy, I am further comforted bythe subsequent understanding and acknowledgement by D3 and TP that WLâs letter of 14 April 2009 (see paragraph 23 above) amountsto a disclaimer of liability as well as a rejection of D3âs claim for indemnity under the Policy.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  First, WKT wrote to WL on the following day (ie 15 April 2009) stating that they had D3âs instructions to commence arbitrationproceedings against TP âfor indemnity under the policy in questionâ, and WL replied on 17 April 2009 to confirm instructionsto accept service (see paragraph 24 above).  Plainly both parties have acknowledged TPâs disclaimer of liability by virtue of WLâsletter of 14 April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Secondly, it is pleaded in both the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN (by D3) and 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN (by WKT on behalf of D3) that TP has committed a breach of contract constituted by the Policy â[in] refusing to indemnify [D3]in accordance with the Policyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Thirdly, Leung in his witness statement states that âåå¾ï¼[Leung]å¾ä»£è¡¨å¾å¸«å¾ç¥ï¼[AXA]ééå¶ä»£è¡¨å¾å¸«è¡¨ç¤ºå æ±ºä¸é¡æå°±æ¯æ¬¡æå¤å[D3]æä¾ä¿éï¼æä»¥[D3]è¿«æ¼ç¡å¥ï¼æ¼æ­¤æ¡ä¸­å[AXA]ç¼åºç¬¬ä¸æ¹éç¥æ¸ï¼è¦æ±å®æ ¹æè©²ä¿å®çº[D3]æä¾ä¿éï¼åæ¯ä»[D3]çå¾å¸«è²»åæææå¤±â. Paragraph 24 of Ip Tao Ningâs witness statement served on behalf of TP also confirms that on 14 April 2009 TP ârejected therequest of [D3] for indemnityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Fourthly, paragraph 14 of Mr Kwongâs 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation in support of the Summons confirms that TP has rejected D3âs request for indemnity and has repudiated liability on14 April 2009.  Likewise, Leungâs affirmation also claims that TP relies on its âmisconceived and absurd interpretationâ ofthe Exclusion Clause âwith a view to avoiding policy liabilityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In light of the above, I agree with Mr Cheung that even taking D3âs case to the highest on the basis of the Assumption, TP hasrejected D3âs claim for indemnity under the Policy at the latest by 14 April 2009.</p>    <p><i>(g)  Justification for repudiation on other grounds?</i></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The above discussion is premised on the assumption that the grounds for TPâs repudiation of liability are erroneous.  As a fallback,TP has pleaded that such rejection of claim can be justified on other grounds (eg breach of Condition 5(c) of the Policy) not beenmentioned in WLâs letters dated 5 March and 14 April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  It is trite that âif a party refuses to perform a contract, giving therefore a wrong or inadequate reason or no reason at all,he may yet justify his refusal if there were at the time facts in existence which would have provided a good reason, even if he didnot know of them at the time of his refusalâ [10].  In Clarke, <i>The Law of Insurance Contracts</i> 5<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) para.26-4D(c) at p.833, it is said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf the insurer rejects the claim altogether on another ground, such as lack of cover, the insurer does not thereby waive the possibilityof pleading a breach of condition at a later stage, if that breach occurred prior to the rejection of the claim; the rejection didnot prompt the breach. â¦â¦â [11]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I have referred counsel to <i>Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council</i> <i>v Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%201492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 1492.</a>  In that case, the relevant insurers could have denied liability on coverage grounds, for late notification or on both grounds, butthey rejected the claim on coverage grounds without any reference to late notification.  When they later relied on late notification,it was challenged on the basis that their conduct in relying only on coverage issues amounted to an election not to rely on latenotification and a waiver of their entitlement to do so. Longmore LJ (with whom Hallett and Auld LJJ agreed) held that there mustbe a choice between alternative and inconsistent courses of action open to a contracting party before he was required to elect. â[It] is not sufficient for a party to a contract to have alternative courses of action; for the doctrine of election to apply(which must be remembered requires no acting on it by, or detriment to, the other party) the courses of action must be inconsistentor, as it is sometimes said, mutually exclusiveâ [12].  In that case, the three courses then open to the insurers were âall consistentwith each other because they each led to a denial of liability.  The inconsistent course would have been for [the relevant insurers]to accept liability rather than to deny liability.  If that happened they might well then be held to have elected not to deny liability;but that, of course, is something which did not happenâ [12].  So the insurers were entitled to rely on late notification as anadditional defence.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  I have further referred counsel to <i>Super Chem Products v American Life and General Insurance Co Ltd &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20All%20ER%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 All ER 358.</a>  In that case, Lord Steyn said at p.365 <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ Contract law cannot and does not prevent an insurer from resisting a claim on alternative bases, one involving an allegationof fraud and the other breaches of policy conditions. It would be contrary to principle and business common sense, which underpinour commercial law, to require an insurer to choose between alleging fraud, thereby abandoning the right to invoke other conditionsof the policy, or to rely on those provisions, thereby giving up the right to allege fraud. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Such passage has been quoted with approval by the Privy Council in <i>Nasser Diab v Regent Insurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2006/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] UKPC 29.</a></p>    <p><i>(h)  Waiver of Condition 5(c)?</i></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  <i>Super Chem Products Ltd</i> recognises that the circumstances in which the repudiation has taken place and the act of repudiation in question may justify aninference of waiver by the insurer of his right to insist that the insured comply with the contractual provision or procedural obligationin question. <i>Nasser Diab</i> explains that â[waiver] means the abandonment or relinquishment of a right of defence which may occur either as the result of anelection by the insurer or of the creation of an estoppel precluding him from relying on his contractual rights against the assuredâ[13].  In that case, the Lords could see no basis for arguing that the insurer had elected to relieve the insured of the proceduralobligations as to notification of claim, and the insurer had not said anything that could be categorised as a ârepresentationâ,let alone an unequivocal one, that it would not hold the insured to the conditions of the policy so as to amount to an estoppel.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In the present case, as in <i>Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council</i>, there is no assertion that D3 has acted to its detriment as a result of TPâs failure to mention late notification in WLâs letterof rejection such that TP cannot rely on any estoppel.  Rather, any possible argument that D3 may raise is that TP has elected notto rely on Condition 5(c) and cannot now go back on its election.  However, I am of the view that there are no inconsistent coursesof action that will debar TP from relying on breach of Condition 5(c) (if any) in TP denying liability by WLâs letter dated 14April 2009 on policy coverage grounds and by its Defence in the third party proceedings that additionally asserts breach of the notificationrequirements</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  As Mr Cheung submits, waiver requires clear and unambiguous conduct and/or representation, and there is none in this case.  Butthis, of course, still begs the question whether TP is able to show a clear case of breach of Condition 5(c).</p>    <p><i>(i)  Breach of Condition 5(c)?</i></p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  As a starting point, Condition 5(c) (which provides that âno claim under this Policy shall be payable unless the terms of thiscondition have been complied withâ) is a condition precedent that imposes an absolute obligation. In the absence of waiver, TPis entitled to rely upon any breach thereof unaccompanied by any resulting prejudice to escape liability [14].</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Secondly, has D3 forwarded any âwrit summons or other proceedings which may be commenced against [D3]â âas soon as possibleâ? According to TP (as verified by Mr Kwongâs 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation), D3 was prosecuted and convicted of various offences under the ESS Summonses, and P issued the Writ of Summons in thepresent proceedings against <i>inter alia</i> D3 on 20 August 2008, but D3 has not notified or forwarded to TP the ESS Summonses and/or the Writ of Summons as required under Condition5(c).  TP claims it was only on 17 February 2009 that D2 forwarded the Writ of Summons to AXA through its loss adjuster, and on 28February 2009 that WKT acting for Wing Lung wrote to urge D3 (with copy to AXA) to seek indemnity from AXA under the Policy and toacknowledge service of the Writ of Summons pending notification to AXA (see paragraph 17 above).</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  On the other hand, D3 in its Reply in the third party proceedings avers that through D2 and in turn the Employer it has notifiedTP about the Accident and the intention to claim under the Policy, and that TP has waived operation and compliance of the requirementsunder Condition 5(c) on the part of D3.  However, Leungâs affirmation does not condescend to any sufficient conduct and/or representationby D3 of any waiver of the requirements for forwarding to TP the ESS Summonses and/or the Writ of Summons herein (as distinct fromgiving notice of the Accident to TP).  I am not persuaded by Mr Sakhraniâs suggestion that this issue raises a factual disputethat should be resolved at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Nevertheless, there is no information before me on the offences for which D3 was prosecuted and/or convicted under the ESS Summonsesand/or on their connection (if any) with D3âs Liability that would have required notification to TP [15].  In my view, it mustbe arguable that there may not have been any breach of Condition 5(c) as a result of failure to forward the ESS Summonses to TP.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As regards the Writ of Summons herein, D2 has forwarded it to TP <i>via</i> the loss adjuster on 17 February 2009 (see paragraph 79 above).  In my view, there would have been sufficient compliance if it hadbeen forwarded to TP âas soon as possibleâ even by a party other than D3 [16].  But has TP satisfied the criterion of âas soonas possibleâ?  Although there is no clear evidence before me as to when the Writ of Summons was actually served on D3, the letterfrom Pâs solicitors to the court dated 2 January 2009 confirms that it has not been served up to that time.  There is an endorsementon the backsheet of the filed copy of the Statement of Claim that such pleading has been served on Ds on 5 February 2009.  The Writof Summons must have been served on D3 some time between 2 January and 5 February 2009. In the circumstances, I am unable to sayat a strike out application that notification and forwarding of the Writ of Summons herein to TP on 17 February 2009 necessarilyfalls foul of the requirement of âas soon as possibleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  In summary, I am not satisfied that any breach of Condition 5(c) is plain and obvious.  But this does not alter my view that (onthe basis of the Assumption) TP has clearly but wrongfully rejected D3âs claim for indemnity in respect of D3âs Liability underthe Policy to satisfy the first element under Condition 10(e).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>X. </i> <i>LIMITATION DEFENCE UPON REJECTION OF CLAIM</i></p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The next question is that whether Condition 10(e) survives TPâs repudiation of liability or rejection of D3âs claim.  Mr Sakhranisubmits that the limitation provision no longer applies, but Mr Cheung submits otherwise.  In this respect, I have referred the partiesto <i>Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Ltd (The New York Star)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%203%20All%20ER%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 3 All ER 257</a> and <i>Super Chem Products Ltd</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In <i>Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd</i>, Lord Wilberforce at pp.261-262 said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ A breach of a repudiatory character, â¦â¦ entitles the innocent party, unless he waives the breach, to claim to be releasedfrom further performance of his obligations under the contract. So far their Lordships of course agree. One of these obligations,counsel proceeded to argue, was to bring any action on the breach within a period of one year, and the innocent party was releasedfrom his obligations. An alternative way of putting it was that the bringing of suit within a year was a condition with which theinnocent party was obliged to comply; the repudiatory breach discharged this condition. â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">Their Lordshipsâ opinion on these arguments is clear. However adroitly presented, they are unsound, and indeed unreal. â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">Moreover it is quite unreal to equate this [limitation clause] with those provisions in the contract which relate to performance. It is a clause which comes into operation when contractual performance has become impossible, or has been given up; then, it regulatesthe manner in which liability for breach of contract is to be established. In this respect their Lordships found it relevantly indistinguishablefrom an arbitration clause, or a forum clause, which, on clear authority, survive a repudiatory breach. â¦â¦  Counsel for the consigneeappealed for support to some observations by Lord Diplock in <i>Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All ER 556</a> at 566-567,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20WLR%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 WLR 283</a>, 294-295, where reference is made to putting an end âto all primary obligations â¦ remaining unperformedâ.

There thenarise, on his Lordshipâs analysis, secondary obligations which include an obligation to pay monetary compensation.  Whether thesehave been modified by agreement is a matter of construction of the contract.  The analysis, indeed, so far from supporting the consigneeâsargument, is directly opposed to it.  Their Lordships are of the opinion that, on construction and analysis, [the limitation provision]plainly operates to exclude.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  In <i>Super Chem Products Ltd</i>, the Privy Council cited the above passage from <i>Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd</i> with approval.  In my view, it is ultimately a matter of construction whether or not D3 and TP have intended Condition 10(e) to survivethe repudiation of liability.  But applying the rationale in the above authorities, it must be plain that Condition 10(e) survivesTPâs repudiation of liability and rejection of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  I now turn to the question of whether D3âs third party âaction or suitâ against TP has âcommencedâ on or before 13 July2009 (ie within 3 months of TPâs rejection of D3âs claim for indemnity under the Policy latest by 14 April 2009).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>XI. </i> <i>ACTION OR SUIT COMMENCED</i></p>    <p><i>(a)  Action or suit</i></p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  It is common ground that (a) the description of âaction or suitâ in Condition 10(e) refers to legal proceedings including thirdparty proceedings, and (b) the originating process for commencing third party proceedings is the third party notice.</p>    <p><i>(b)  Dispute</i></p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  It is important to ascertain the date of âcommencementâ of D3âs third party claim against TP because the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN is before and the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN is after the deadline of 13 July 2009 under Condition 10(e) (see paragraph 87 above).</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  There is no dispute the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN was not issued but merely served on AXA under cover of D3âs letter dated 6 May 2009 (see paragraph 25 above). D3 argues the1<sup>st</sup> TPN amounts to sufficient âcommencementâ of âaction or suitâ within the meaning of Clause 10(e). In maintaining such stance,Mr Sakhrani does not suggest that D3âs third party âaction or suitâ against TP was actually instituted by the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN. Rather, he contends that D3 has purported to begin third party proceedings by the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN, which has not been sealed and/or issued out of the High Court registry, and it is open to the court to hold that the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN has cured such procedural irregularity (which does not nullify the third party proceedings purportedly commenced by D3) as athing âleft undoneâ âin any other respectâ that falls within the curative power of Order 2 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1</a> (âO2r1â) of the RHC (âRHCâ), so that as from 4 May 2009 the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN is to be treated as the properly constituted third party notice for the purpose of proceeding with D3âs âaction or suitâagainst TP.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  On the other hand, TP argues that D3 has not commenced any third party proceedings by the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN, which has not been sealed or issued out of the High Court registry. Since the court is not seized of the matter and/or O2r1cannot cure such fundamental failure, the earliest date for the commencement of D3âs third party proceedings against TP is 23 July2009 (ie when the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN was issued out of the High Court registry â see paragraph 30 above), but by that time D3âs third party claim against TP isalready time-barred under Condition 10(e).</p>    <p><i>(c)  âCommencementâ of third party proceedings</i></p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Mr Sakhrani argues that under Order 16 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 3(4)</a> (âO16r3(4)â) of the RHC it is only in certain circumstances that third party proceedings are looked at as if the third partynotice were a writ of summons, and it is poignant that TPâs argument is based on contractual and not statutory limitation defence.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  O16r3(4) provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSubject to the foregoing provisions of this rule, the following provisions of these rules, namely, Order 6, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 7(3)</a> and (5) â¦â¦ shall apply in relation to a third party notice and to the <i>proceedings began thereby</i> as if â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) the third party notice were a writ and the <i>proceedings began thereby</i> an action; and</p>        <p class="quote">(b) the defendant issuing the third party notice were a plaintiff and the person against whom it is issued a defendant in that action.â(my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Order 6 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 7(3)</a> (âO6r7(3)â) of the RHC provides that the â<i>[issue]</i> of a writ takes place upon its being sealed by an officer of the Registryâ (my emphasis).

There were âproceedingsâ inbeing at the very moment that the plaintiff made his affidavit and his solicitor lodged it with the registrarâ. It was held thatfailure to comply with the rules of the court on jurisdiction did not render the application a nullity but amounted only to an irregularity,so the defect on the form of the district registrarâs order could be amended under the rules of court, and the court granted leavefor such purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In <i>Harrison &amp; anor</i>, the plaintiffsâ writ claiming damages in contract and tort was issued on 8 July 1992. Irregular service of the writ on 6 November1992 failed to bring the proceedings to the notice of the defendant. It came to the attention of one of the defendantâs partnerson 9 November 1992, but by that time the claim in contract had become statute-barred. If time were to stop running on the claim intort but not so as to defeat the limitation defence in respect of the claim in contract which had accrued, the writ had to be treatedas having been issued on 9 November 1992 and not earlier. The first instance judge having refused extension of the validity of thewrit and refused to treat the irregular service of the writ as good service directed that the writ be treated as issued and servedon 9 November 1992. The Court of Appeal held otherwise as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ it was not open to it to treat a writ as issued months before or after the date it was in fact issued.

The court received the draft writ on 28 July 1998, but a court clerk rejected and returned it to theplaintiff with a note saying that the indorsement should be headed up statement of claim. The plaintiff did not receive it until9 August 1998, and when she re-submitted the draft writ it was too late. The Court of Appeal accepted the draft writ was in the custodyof the proper officer of the court on the earlier date, so the writ could and should have been issued on the earlier occasion, andthe failure to do so was entirely the responsibility of the court official. As in <i>Harrison &amp; anor</i>, it was stressed that there was a need to distinguish between cases where the plaintiff was responsible for a failure to comply withthe rules, and others where it was not.

In that case, the court had to consider when proceedings for possession were âbegunâfor the purpose of Part V of the Housing Act 1996 dealing with introductory tenancies. The court held that proceedings were âbegunâwhen they were âstartedâ as provided by CPR rule 7.2 which provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Proceeding are started when the court issues a claim form at the request of the Claimant.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) A claim form is issued on the date entered on the form by the court.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was held that the proceedings were not begun on the day when the claim form was delivered to the court because difficulties wouldensue if the date of receipt by the court office was taken as the date on which proceedings were begun. The tenant should not haveto enquire with the court office whether the claim form had been received on some earlier date (see para.26 <i>per</i> Chadwick LJ). Maurice Kay LJ opined that it was axiomatic that the beginning of proceedings under section 130 of the Housing Act1996 must bear the same meaning as the starting of proceedings as described in CPR rule 7.2; that point being defined as the pointof issue of a claim form at the request of the claimant. He rejected any analogy between the âstartingâ of proceedings underCPR rule 7.2 and the âbringingâ of proceedings for the purpose of the Limitation Act 1980 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ Here the language in issue is not the âbringing of proceedingsâ but the âbeginning of proceedingsâ. Where thereis a general provision aimed at a point of time at which proceedings are started, it follows that the assimilation of when proceedingsare begun and when they are started is conclusive. The extended meaning, given specifically in the context of the bringing of proceedingsfor the purposes of the Limitation Act, has no bearing on the present circumstances. I too would allow this appeal.â (para.35)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><i>(e)  Issue of third party proceedings being âcommencementâ of third party âaction or suitâ</i></p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Here, the second element under Condition 10(e) refers to an âaction or suitâ being âcommencedâ within 3 months after therejection of claim. In my view, the concept of legal proceedings having begun, started or commenced must all refer to the same event,and the assimilation of the time when proceedings are begun with the time when they are started or when they are commenced is plainand obvious. Thus, the âaction or suitâ (ie the third party proceedings which are legal proceedings analogous to the proceedingsfor possession in <i>Salford City Council</i>) is âcommencedâ under Condition 10(e) when it is âstartedâ or âbegunâ under Order 16 and Order 6 of the RHC by the issuanceof a third party notice (analogous to the claim form under the CPR) upon its being issued out of the court registry (analogous toCPR rule 7.2). In the circumstances, quite irrespective of whether D3 approached the High Court registry for issuance of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN on 4 May 2009 or not (see paragraph 109 below), it is plain and obvious that the only third party notice that has been issued(ie sealed by the court official) in the present proceedings is the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN. Hence, the third party âaction or suitâ was âcommencedâ on 23 July 2009 and not earlier, and it is therefore time-barredunder the contractual limitation provision in Condition 10(e).</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Even if I am wrong, the above authorities are clear that O2r1 does not apply to fundamental defects. This is also borne out by <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 paras.2/1/1-2/1/2 at pp.47-49 which give examples of fundamental defects that cannot be cured under O2r1, eg failure to renewa writ for service so that service after the expiry of a writ is bad and liable to be set aside, entry of judgment in default ofdefence before expiry of the statutory period allowed for service of a defence, non-existence of the corporate plaintiff at the dateof commencement of the proceedings, etc.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  It is also clear from <i>Harkness</i> and <i>Harrison &amp; anor</i> that the defects pertaining to the originating process or application that are curable under O2r1 are those errors or omissions dueto non-compliance with the rules upon such originating process or application having been made to or having been tendered unto thecustody of the court. In my view, the very failure of delivering an originating process (no matter how badly it fails to comply withthe rules) to the custody of the court is a fundamental defect outside the scope of O2r1.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  This principle rests on the underlying premise that the court registry has no power to reject any originating process submittedunless it requires leave of the court or is illegible, meaningless or abusive (see paragraph 99 above). It also underlines the significanceof the date of issuance of the originating process, which is the point in time at which the court is seized of the matter, and whichensures certainty and obviates enquiry as to what earlier date legal proceedings should be regarded as having started, commencedor begun.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  However, Mr Sakhrani argues that a properly constituted action is already in place by the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN, so the court is already seized of the matter and can exercise its powers under O2r1. But even assuming for the present purposethe 1<sup>st</sup> TPN sets out all the information TP needs in order to be able to understand what is being claimed, I cannot see how it can be saidthat the court has already seized of the matter on either 4 or 6 May 2009. Quite simply, the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN was not in the custody of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  The next consideration is whether, in light of the above authorities (eg <i>Re Cinerent Ltd</i>, <i>Rinniker</i> and <i>Barnes</i>), D3 is blameless for the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN not being sealed by the court officer or issued out of the High Court registry in May 2009, so that the court can exercise itsinherent jurisdiction to ensure that D3 is not prejudiced.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Leungâs affirmation states that on 4 May 2009 he was refused issuance of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN at the High Court registry âon the basis that [D3] was then acting in personâ. The relevant statutory provision is Order5 rule 6(2) of the RHC which provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA body corporate may not <i>begin</i> or carry on <i>such proceedings</i> in the Court otherwise than by a solicitor except â</p>        <p class="quote">(a) as expressly provided by or under any enactment; or</p>        <p class="quote">(b) where leave is given under paragraph (3) for it to be represented by one of its directors.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In my view, save for exceptional circumstances, the prohibition against a body corporate (eg D3) from commencing or beginning legalproceedings is absolute unless the court has granted leave for it to be represented by one of its directors.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In <i>Crescent Oil and Shipping Services Ltd v Importang UEE &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20All%20ER%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 All ER 428</a>, a case cited by Mr Sahkrani, the plaintiffs issued proceedings against the defendants for breach of contract. The writ carried theindorsement that it was issued by the plaintiffsâ in-house solicitor when in fact she was on holiday at the time. Her solicitorswrote to say that the writ was not issued by her or with her authority or privity, and she subsequently left the plaintiffsâ employ.The writ was then served by registered post and thereafter default judgment was entered. When the plaintiffs attempted to enforcethe judgment, some of the defendants applied to set aside the issue and service of the writ. Thomas J said at p.438 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ However, the absolute nature of the prohibition set out in Ord 5, r 6(2) is underlined by the provision of Ord 12, r.1(2);this rule permits a body corporate to acknowledge service and give notice of intention to defend, but prohibits any further stepin the action otherwise than by a solicitor. The court does, however, have discretion to permit in exceptional circumstances representationof a body corporate by a person other than a solicitor â¦â¦ In [<i>Radford v Freeway Classics Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20BCLC%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 BCLC 445]</a>, the discretion to allow such representation was described as a limited gloss on very clear legislative provisions in Ord 5, r 6(2)requiring a limited company to pursue its litigation by legal advisers. It may possibly be the case that a court does in exceptionalcircumstances (such as the imminent expiry of a time bar) have power to permit a body corporate to issue a writ, but in general theprohibition in the rules is absolute. <i>In the circumstances of this case, the writ should have been either issued or served as Crescent were not acting by the solicitor.</i> <i>Ratification cannot assist Crescent as the rules prohibit what was done and it cannot be cured retrospectively.</i>â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Are there exceptional circumstances in the present case? Mr Sakhrani agrees that an application to the Registrar should have beenmade, but suggested that âthe defect was in relation to a legal step which in all probability could have been taken with legaladvice without difficultyâ, and there is no reason to suppose that leave to proceed without a solicitor would not have been granted,particularly in light of the impending expiry of the contractual limitation period. </p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  I disagree.  With the expiry of the contractual limitation period more than 2 months away (ie on 13 July 2009), there was no riskof imminent time bar as at 4 May 2009. I am also not persuaded that the rest of Mr Sakhraniâs submissions amount to any exceptionalcircumstances that may justify any notional permission by the court for D3 to issue the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN without solicitors.  In any event, no such application has been made by D3.  Indeed, D3 has not applied for leave to be representedby one of its directors notwithstanding the reminder by Master B Kwan to its representative present at the CLR hearing only 4 daysafter the date of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN (ie on 8 May 2009) to instruct solicitors to act for D3 or apply for a director to represent D3 as soon as possible (see paragraph27 above), and the subsequent reminder by Pâs solicitors to D3 dated 1 June 2009 (see paragraph 29 above).</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Clearly it cannot be said that D3 has been blameless for the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN never having been in the custody of the court. In fact, I will go so far as to say the court registry has properly rejected the1<sup>st</sup> TPN on the basis that D3 is prohibited from issuing the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN without the leave of the court.  Indeed, <i>Crescent Oil and Shipping Services Ltd</i> shows that ratification cannot assist as therules prohibit what Mr Sakhrani proposes this court to do, and in my view the defectin question cannot be cured retrospectively. Whilst I agree that O2r1 should be construed liberally, I am not persuaded its scopeis wide enough to cover so-called âproceedingsâ (which in truth are not proceedings as such) that have not been made to the courtat all due to matters within the applicantâs control.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Mr Sakhrani prays in aid the courtâs wide powers of case management.  He reminds that in giving effect to the underlying objectiveswhich include the promotion of procedural economy in the conduct of proceedings and ensuring fairness between the parties, the courtmust remember that the primary aim is to secure the just resolution of disputes in accordance with the substantive rights of theparties (see Order 1A rule 2(2) of the RHC).  Mr Sakhrani argues that it is open to the court âto order that the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN cured the irregularity in the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN and as such was the properly constituted TPN for the purpose of <u>proceeding</u> with the claimâ, which accords with the 8/12/09 Order that the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN do stand as the third party notice issued by D3 âbecause it cured the irregularity in the 1<sup>st</sup> TPNâ.  It is further suggested that there is no prejudice to TP in its substantive rights.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  In my view, the underlying objectives in Order 1A of the RHC cannot be a panacea for all procedural ills and, more importantly,fundamental defects.  I accept that O2r1 must be construed liberally with the underlying objectives in mind in order, so far as isreasonable and proper, to prevent injustice being caused to one party by mindless adherence to technicalities in the rules of procedure,but it must be remembered that the âpower given to the court by O.2, r.1 is a power to cure irregularities consisting of failuresto comply with the rules.  There is no power to remedy failures of a more fundamental kindâ [18].</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I also disagree with Mr Sakhraniâs reading of the 8/12/09 Order.  In fact, such proposition flies in the face of D3âs own previousstance and the true purport of such order.  In fact, until its present opposition to the Summons, it has all along been D3âs stanceunder legal advice that (a) the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN not being issued out of court is invalid and a nullity, and there were in fact no third party proceedings at the time, so thatthe third party proceedings by D3 against TP only began by the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN issued by WKT on behalf of D3 [19].  Since D3 claims there were no third party proceedings on foot by virtue of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN, D3 (through WKT) by the amended AS Summons has sought an order to set aside the AS or alternatively to have the AS deemed asa valid acknowledgment of service to the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN that was sealed and issued out of the High Court registry (see paragraphs 33 and 36 above).  WL on behalf of TP had no objectionto the alternative relief sought so long as D3 made clear which third party notice it intended to rely. As there is no doubt fromMs Lumâs affirmation that D3 intended to rely on the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN and not the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN which was considered to be invalid and a nullity, I granted the 8/12/09 Order set out in paragraph 36 above.  The 1<sup>st</sup> TPN was not sealed or issued out of the High Court registry and consequently not in the custody of the court at all, so there wasno need to give any further directions to deal with such document.  Rather, the court has given clear directions that the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN do stand as the third party notice âissuedâ by D3 against TP in these proceedings.  On such basis and for the sake of proceduraleconomy under the underlying objectives, I also directed that the AS do stand as the acknowledgment of service to the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN. </p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  In my view, it is abundantly clear that the court has held that the third party proceedings were constituted and commenced by the2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, which is consistent with the position adopted by D3 at that time and to which TP had no objection.  Since the AS has been treatedand deemed to be the acknowledgment of service to the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN under the 8/12/09 Order, quite understandably no further acknowledgment of service has been filed in response to the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN. Until Mr Sakhraniâs submissions, there has been, quite simply, no suggestion by D3 or TP and/or in the 8/12/09 Order thatthe 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN has cured any irregularity in the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN to enable it to be properly constituted as the relevant third party notice.  Further, I am unable to see any need to recognisethe 1<sup>st</sup> TPN âfor the purpose of <u>proceeding</u> with the claimâ.  D3 has chosen to proceed with the claim by the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN. It has asked that the AS to be deemed to be a valid acknowledgment of service for the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, and the court has so ordered.  The fact that TP has raised a limitation defence in the course of defending such third partyproceedings so commenced by the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN has no bearing on the constitution of and proceeding with the third party claim.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  In my view, the stance now adopted by D3 contradicts the position it has taken at the time of the AS Summons and fails to sit togetherwith the 8/12/09 Order which has plainly recognised the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN and not the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN as the originating process by which D3âs third party action or suit against TP has been commenced.  Mr Sakhrani reminds thatTP has acted on the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN by serving the AS, but at the hearing before me he concedes that such service cannot amount to any waiver of the contractuallimitation defence.  In my view, it also cannot amount to any waiver on the part of TP of the consequences of D3 not having issuedthe 1<sup>st</sup> TPN or, as Leung puts it in paragraph 9(d) of his affirmation, any election by TP to defend D3âs claim by virtue of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN notwithstanding their awareness that the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN was not formally issued.  After all, this very issue has been raised and is the subject of the 8/12/09 Order from which therehas been no appeal and is therefore binding on D3 and TP. Further, Order 12 rule 7 of the RHC (made applicable to third party proceedingsby O16r3(4)) provides that the acknowledgment by a defendant of service of a writ shall not be treated as a waiver by him of anyirregularity in the writ or service thereof or in any order giving leave to serve the writ or extending the validity of the writfor the purpose of service thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  I also note that D3 in asking the court to treat the âaction or suitâ in the third party proceedings as having been âcommencedâon 4 or 6 May 2009 does not say how the courts should deal with the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, which by the 8/12/09 Order is ordered to stand as the third party notice âissuedâ by D3 against TP and on which D3, TP andthe court have acted.  Indeed, on the basis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN and the 8/12/09 Order, the court has granted third party directions, and D3 and TP have already acted on these directions byfiling/serving pleadings, making discovery and serving witness statements.  There is no difficulty in proceeding with the claim onthe basis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN.  To accede to D3âs aforesaid contention now only serves the purpose of allowing D3 to enter through the backdoor of O2r1 whatit cannot do by the front door in face of O6r7(3), O16r3(4), the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, the amended AS Summons, Ms Lumâs affirmation and the 8/12/09 Order so as to defeat TPâs contractual limitation defence [20]. I am unable to say there will be no prejudice to TP in its substantive rights.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid analysis, I am satisfied it is plain and obvious that the third party âaction or suitâ herein âcommencedâupon the issue of the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN, and there is no basis for the court to treat the date of the 1<sup>st</sup> TPN (ie 4 May 2009) or the date of its service on AXA (ie 6 May 2009) as the date when the third party proceedings by D3 againstTP has commenced or begun.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>XII.  CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  In such circumstances, D3âs contractual limitation defence must be upheld, and I therefore strike out the 2<sup>nd</sup> TPN and dismiss D3âs claim against TP.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I also direct that the action be restored for CLR hearing before me on 23 December 2010 at 2:30pm to be attended by solicitors forP and Ds, and that D3 shall forthwith notify the other parties to the main action in writing of the results of this decision andgive notice of the adjourned CLR hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  On a separate note, the court notes that WKT has become solicitors on the record for D3 on 30 June 2009. Since TP concedes thatthe contractual limitation period did not expire until 13 July 2009, but given the stance adopted in Ms Lumâs affirmation as regardsthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> TPNs, and the decision herein, WKT is required to assure the PI Master at the adjourned CLR that they have duly advised D3 and aresatisfied they are in a position to continue to act for D3 in the present proceedings notwithstanding any potential conflict of interest.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  There is no reason why costs should not follow event.  I therefore grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that save and except for costs referred to in the paragraph below, D3 do pay TP costs of the third party proceedings and of the Summons(including all costs reserved if any) with certificate for counsel to be taxed if not agreed.  At the hearing before me, I have raisedwith counsel the possibility of summary assessment of costs.  But upon more mature reflection in light of my conclusions on the Summons,ordinary taxation is more appropriate as the costs order <i>nisi</i> covers not only the costs of the application but also costs of the whole third party proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  In respect of the aforesaid caveat on costs, I note that there is duplication of materials in the hearing bundle placed before me.For example, there are several copies of the Policy in the hearing bundle and there are duplicated copies of <i>inter partes</i> correspondence. Such duplication adds nothing to the efficient and effective resolution of the application but burdens the partieswith unnecessary effort and costs. Unless good cause is shown to the contrary on taxation, D3 and TP shall bear their own respectivecosts for including and considering such duplicated documents in the hearing bundle.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Marlene Ng)<br />          Master of the High Court <br /></td>        </tr>    </table>       <p style="text-align:left"> </p>	<p style="text-align:left">Representation:</p><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p>Mr Ashok Sakhrani instructed by Messrs W K To for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p>Mr Kam Cheung instructed by Messrs Winnie Leung &amp; Co for the Third Party.</p></representation><!--sino section text -->    <p>____________________</p>    <p>[1] see paragraph 6 of the witness statement of D3âs director Leung Wai Po dated 13 May 2010 and paragraph 12 of the witness statementof Ip Tao Ning, TPâs Senior Manager â Claims, dated 26 May 2010</p>    <p>[2] <i>Kanson Crane Service Company Limited</i> at paras.14-15 â see paragraph 43 above â and <i>Colinvauxâs Law of Insurance</i> 8<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) para.9-35 at pp.322-323</p>    <p>[3] <i>Kanson Crane Service Company Limited</i> at para.20</p>    <p>[4] see the proviso of âexcept as hereinafter providedâ in the Coverage Clause</p>    <p>[5] <i>Dragages et Travaux Publics (HK) Limited and Penta-Ocean</i> <i>Construction Company Limited t/a âDragages â Penta Joint Ventureâ</i> at para.30</p>    <p>[6] <strong><i>Keung Shiu Tang v.
