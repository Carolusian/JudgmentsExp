The original plaintiff was Kincheng Banking Corporationwhich subsequently amalgamated with the present plaintiff. I will simply call it "the bank". By the action, the bank claimed againstsix defendants in respect of debts owed by the 1st defendant incurred by it by using the banking facilities provided to it by thebank. The other defendants were either mortgagors of properties mortgaged to the bank as security for the grant of the banking facilitiesto the 1st defendant or guarantors of the 1st defendant's debts owed to the bank.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The trial before the judge only involved the bank and the 4th defendant, the bank having recovered part of its claim from the otherdefendants by way of money judgements and orders for possession of the properties mortgaged by the other defendants to it.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> As far as the 4th defendant is concerned, she had mortgaged two properties to the bank by way of two legal charges ("the two legalcharges"), namely, one dated 28 January 1994 in respect of Flat C, 20th Floor, Fu Yan Yuen, Chi Fu Fa Yuen, and the other dated 21April 1994 in respect of Flat E, 25th Floor, Block 8, City Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> By his judgment of 2 May 2002, the judge made an order for possession of the two properties in favour of the bank, and ordered thebank to recover against the 4th defendant the sum of $33,737,481.50 (after credit being given to the sums recovered by the bank principallyfrom the realisation of other properties and securities charged to it by the other defendants), with interest. The judge also orderedthe 4th defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings on a full indemnity basis to the bank, to be taxed if not agreed. That basisof taxation of costs was founded on the contractual agreement between the bank and the 4th defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 4th defendant now seeks an order to set aside the judgment and a retrial, or alternatively, to vary the judgment so that it isfor a lesser sum than that ordered by the judge. By a late amendment to the Notice of Appeal, for which I granted leave on 9 May2003, Mr Albert Yau, for the 4th defendant, raises grounds of appeal in substitution for all the grounds set out in the originalNotice of Appeal and other supplementary Notices of Appeal filed previously by the 4th defendant in person.</p>    <p class="heading">The grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Only three substantial grounds of appeal are raised by the Amended Notice of Appeal, the fourth ground only asking for a retrialand directions. The first two grounds of appeal are factually based on two letters dated respectively 28 January 1994 and 21 April1994 ("facility letters"), both of which were before the judge at the trial. Both facility letters were addressed to the bank, andthey were apparently prepared by solicitors appointed by the bank to prepare the legal charges to be executed by the 4th defendant.The facility letter dated 28 January 1994 addressed to the bank reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Dear Sirs,</p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">Re:</td>                <td valign="top" width="95%" class="quote"><em>Flat C on the 20th Floor of Fu Yan Yuen, Chi Fu Fa Yuen, Hong Kong</em></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="95%" class="quote"><em>Mortgagor : Cheung Hau Kwan</em></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="95%" class="quote"><em>Requesting Party : Senlaveer (Pacific) Company Limited</em></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We, the undersigned hereby confirm that we will only utilize the General Banking Facilities granted to Senlaveer (Pacific) CompanyLimited under the Legal Charge of the above property only up to the extent of $2,400,000.00 notwithstanding the fact that the LegalCharge was created to secure General Banking Facilities to an unlimited extent.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">Yours faithfully,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%" class="quote"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%" class="quote">Senlaveer (Pacific) Co.

Ground2 is to the effect that the judge failed to consider whether a case of material variation of the terms of the two mortgages to thedetriment of the 4th defendant had been made out which discharged the mortgages altogether.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Ground 3 can be summarised as being based on a statement made in the 4th defendant's witness statement dated 23 November 2001, whichis translated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"6. About one and a half years after my lending out the title deeds, on five occasions I had been to the Kincheng Bank at North Pointto look for Choi Sui Kwan [Choi Suiqun] twice, to look for Wong Sau Ying, the person in charge, three times, with intention to getback my title deeds. My request was rejected by Wong Sau Ying, the person in charge, for the reason that because it was businesssecret, she could not deal with me direct."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Based on this fact, ground 3 states that the judge, through no fault of his own, did not consider whether in the circumstances ofthe case, the bank owed to the 4th defendant a duty under the law of tort or implied under contract to take such steps as may bereasonably necessary for the protection of the interest of the principal borrower, the 4th defendant as guarantor and itself as creditorwhen the 4th defendant gave notice to the bank that she was no longer willing to continue assuming liability under the guarantee/mortgageand wanted to recall the guarantee/mortgage. The ground further poses the question that if the answer to the above is in the affirmative,whether such duty on the part of the bank had been broken and the question, in the event of breach of such duty, as to what the appropriaterelief, if any, should be.</p>    <p class="heading">Grounds not pleaded</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> While some evidence for raising the three grounds of appeal was apparently before the judge at the trial, the points taken by thethree grounds were never pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Although the action was commenced by way of originating summons, pleadings between the bank and the 4th defendant were served pursuantto the order of Master Poon made on 9 September 1999. At the initial stage of the proceedings, the 4th defendant was apparently actingin person, because she had filed a document written apparently in her own hand in Chinese entitled "Application for Assistance" dated26 August 1998, setting out some circumstances of how she came to execute the legal charges in respect of her two properties, butmainly talking about her family and matrimonial problems, and urging the court to allow her to retain the two properties for herown use. Before the Statement of Claim was filed and served, the 4th defendant became represented. There was an affirmation in Englishmade by her on 2 June 1999, which was filed by a firm of solicitors. A Defence dated 8 November 1999 was filed on her behalf, repeatingher matrimonial difficulties and raised the defence of undue influence by the 2nd defendant, Cheung Ling Mun, causing her to executethe two legal charges.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Apparently, however, approaching the trial, the 4th defendant was acting in person, because she caused to be filed her own witnessstatement and the witness statements of her witnesses which were typed in Chinese. Before the judge at the trial, the 4th defendantwas unrepresented.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In his judgment, the judge identified the 4th defendant's defences as comprising undue inference and <em>non est factum</em>. After analysing the evidence very carefully, he found against both defences. The points now raised on appeal were apparently notrelied on by the 4th defendant before him.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Mr Yau has directed our attention to the reference to the two facility letters in the opening submission of counsel for the bankbefore the judge. When these two facility letters were mentioned to the judge, the judge queried whether the liability of the 4thdefendant was limited to $2.4 million plus $8 million as set out in the two facility letters. He repeatedly expressed the view thatthe two facility letters should have such an effect or else they would serve no useful purpose. Counsel explained that the effectof the facility letters were for the purpose of explaining to the 1st defendant (the principal borrower) and the 4th defendant (themortgagor) the extent of the banking facilities that the bank had agreed to provide to them under each of the two legal charges.On the other hand, because of the provisions of the two legal charges, and in particular the covenant to pay all outstanding indebtednessin clause 2.01 thereof, the 4th defendant, as the mortgagor, had made a personal covenant to pay in full the indebtedness of the1st defendant. In the end, the judge expressed the view that the two facility letters did not take the bank's case any further andthey only served to complicate matters. Counsel then explained that the two facility letters were included in the documents presentedto the judge in order to give the court a whole picture. There the matter rested. The two facility letters were not referred to inthe oral testimonies of the parties' witnesses or in the judge's judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground 1</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> As far as I understand, Mr Yau's submissions on ground 1 are on two bases. First, in view of the matrix of facts, the two legal chargesshould properly be construed as the bank having agreed to limit the 4th defendant's liability to the stated amounts of $2.4 millionand $8 million. Secondly, on the strength of the case of <strong>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Fung Chin Kan and Anr</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKLRD%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKLRD 181</a> Mr Yau argues that there was a collateral or composite agreement in the instant case that the liability of the 4th defendant underthe two charges was limited to those sums.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is without dispute that clause 2.01 of each of the two legal charges contained a personal covenant on the part of the 4th defendantto pay in full all the outstanding indebtedness of the 1st defendant, the principal borrower. Mr Yau directs our attention to thefollowing matters as the factual matrix in construing the legal charges in such a way that the 4th defendant's liability must havebeen limited to $2.4 million and $8 million respectively, namely,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The bank did not need the two facility letters to limit its lending, as there were other documents making such a limit or thebank could simply impose a limit from time to time. On that basis, therefore, by necessary implication, the two facility letterswere intended by the bank or indicated the bank's agreement to limit the 4th defendant's liability to those two sums.</p>        <p>(2) Save that the two facility letters recorded the bank's agreement to limit the 4th defendant's liability under the two charges,there would have been no necessity for the bank to require the 4th defendant to sign them.</p>        <p>(3) When the two legal charges were executed by the 4th defendant, the 1st defendant, as the principal borrower, had already obtainedfacilities that exceeded the two stated sums. The only rational explanation of requiring the two facility letters to be signed bythe 1st and 4th defendants, in accordance with proper commercial morality, was that the 1st defendant and the 4th defendant agreedto limit the two charges to those two stated sums, and the bank agreed that the 4th defendant's liability was limited to those twosums.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) The recital to the two legal charges was to the effect that the amount to be advanced by the bank under them could only be increasedby mutual agreement. Therefore the liability of the 4th defendant, unless mutually agreed, could only be limited to the two statedsums.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I do not agree. The plain and ordinary meaning of the two facility letters is that the 1st defendant and the 4th defendant acknowledgedto the bank that they would only use banking facilities to the extent of the stated sums. As the 4th defendant was not the principalborrower and it was the 1st defendant who proposed to borrow from the bank, it was mainly the 1st defendant who acknowledged to thebank that it fully understood that the extent of the banking facilities to be made available by the bank under the two legal chargeswas the stated sums. This plain meaning was supported by the fact that at the time of the execution of the two legal charges, thebank had already granted banking facilities to the 1st defendant and the aim of the creation of the two legal charges in favour ofthe bank was to enlarge the banking facilities to be made available to the 1st defendant by the bank, but only to the extent of thetwo stated sums. By signing the two facility letters, the 4th defendant also made the same acknowledgement to the bank, whereby shewas supposed to know that the banking facilities to be made available to the 1st defendant was not to exceed those two sums. It doesnot, however, mean that there was any agreement that her liability under the two legal charges, and in particular, her personal covenantto pay in full the outstanding indebtedness of the 1st defendant owed to the bank was limited to those two sums. If Mr Yau's argumentis correct, then whenever a legal charge containing a personal covenant to pay all outstanding indebtedness contains a term thatthe banking facilities or bank loans advanced under the legal charge are limited to a certain amount, the personal covenant wouldbe devoid of any effect or would only be of limited effect. This must be incorrect. In other words, such a limit of the loans securedby a legal charge that is agreed by a bank to be made available pursuant to the security does not derogate from the effectivenessof the personal covenant contained in the legal charge to pay all the outstanding indebtedness.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Yau relies very heavily on the <strong>Fung Chin Kan</strong> case. In that case, the Court of Final Appeal held that on the facts of that case, the mortgagors (husband and wife) had limitedtheir risk exposure to $3.3 million upon their execution of the legal charge of their property, valued at $4 million, for the bank'sprovision of banking facilities to a company. The Court held that through the solicitors preparing the legal charge and other documentationrelating thereto the bank knew that the mortgagors' risk exposure had been agreed to the limit of $3.3 million, and that agreementamounted to a collateral agreement or a composite agreement. The Court entered judgment for the bank in the sum of $3.3 million,on the basis that on the mortgagors' own case that they were liable to the bank for that sum.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> However it is to be noted that in that case, the solicitors who prepared the legal charge had also prepared a draft undertaking bythe principal borrower to indemnify the mortgagors of $3.5 million, which sum one of the mortgagors (the husband) had corrected to$3.3 million. The court held that the draft undertaking strongly corroborated the mortgagors' case that there was an agreed limitof $3.3 million as their risk exposure, and that the solicitors who later received instructions from the bank in preparing the legalcharge must have known about it. It further held that the bank could only have given instructions to the solicitors after preliminarydiscussions with the directors of the principal borrower and, as a matter of necessary inference, the matter of the mortgagors' limitof liability must have then been agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In the present case, there was before the judge no evidence of the instructions given by the bank to the two firms of solicitorswho respectively prepared the documentation relating to the two legal charges executed by the 4th defendant. But those representingthe bank in this appeal have, without objection by Mr Yau, produced the bank's related instructions to the solicitors. Each set ofinstructions stated to the effect (a) that a legal mortgage should be prepared to secure general banking facilities to an unlimitedextent and (b) that the mortgagor and principal borrower were requested to acknowledge in writing that the banking facilities availableto them should be limited to $2.4 million and $8 million respectively. Mr Yau contends that these two requirements in the bank'sinstructions were contradictory, creating an ambiguity that should properly be construed as limiting the liability of the mortgagor.For the reasons stated in para 19 above, I do not agree. These two requirements were entirely different and for different purposes,and there is no ambiguity as Mr Yau submits.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Moreover, there were two Chinese documents entitled "guarantee" executed by the 1st defendant in favour of the 4th defendant. Thefirst one dated 14 January 1994 was in respect of the Chi Fu Fa Yuen flat, whereas the "guarantee" in respect of the City Gardenflat was dated 27 May 1994. The first "guarantee" provided that for the 4th defendant's agreeing to mortgage the related flat tothe bank for assisting the 1st defendant's business development, the 1st defendant agreed to pay a monthly sum of $30,000 to the4th defendant as reward for two years after the bank had agreed to grant the banking facilities and that in the third to fifth yearsthereafter, if the 4th defendant wished to, she could, by giving one-month advance notice to the 1st defendant, request the 1st defendantto assist in obtaining from the bank the discharge of the mortgage. The second "guarantee" was in similar terms, save that $100,000instead of $30,000 was provided for as the monthly reward.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In respect of these two "guarantees" the judge said in his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"15. The payments were properly made to her pursuant to the two guarantees for about a year. The payments then became irregular andshe has not kept proper track of them. She said that the payments stopped in late 1997. It was her evidence that she had receivedabout $3 million by way of the guarantee payments.</p>        <p class="quote">16. It was Ms Cheung's [the 4th defendant's] case that both guarantees were received by her after the mortgage was signed. That isplainly the case in respect of the second mortgage for the guarantee, witnessed by a solicitor, is dated 27 May 1994, and the mortgagewas signed on 21 April 1994.</p>        <p class="quote">17. The first mortgage was signed on 24 January 1994 and the first guarantee is dated 14 January 1994. It makes a promise to pay thereward of $30,000 a month 'after the bank has approved the LC and TR amount', a statement that plainly anticipates the bank's agreement,and one which would not be made had the bank already agreed to the arrangement. This was the first transaction that Ms Cheung hadbeen involved in with Mr Cheung [the 2nd defendant, a director of the 1st defendant] and I am satisfied that she wanted assurancethat her actions would be safe. She had every reason to wish to see the terms of the guarantee before the signing of the mortgage.</p>        <p class="quote">18. I find on the balance of probabilities that Ms Cheung received the first guarantee before she signed the first mortgage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The execution of these two "guarantees" by the 1st defendant was apparently witnessed by a solicitor Anthony T K Leung. But AnthonyLeung was not a solicitor instructed by the bank to arrange for the two legal charges to be executed by the 4th defendant. He wasapparently a solicitor retained by the 1st defendant or the 2nd defendant for the purpose of preparing the "guarantees".</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It, therefore, appears that apart from the two facility letters, there is no evidence to show that the bank was aware of any limitof exposure that the 4th defendant intended or wished to take by her creating the two legal charges. Nor is there any evidence toshow that there was an agreement between the 1st defendant as the principal borrower and the 4th defendant as the mortgagor thatthere was a limit of the 4th defendant's risk exposure to the extent of the banking facilities granted by the bank to the 1st defendanton the basis of the legal charges, let alone the bank's knowledge of any such agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Yau argues that had the point been raised in the Defence, or had the judge made further inquiry either during the opening submissionfor the bank or at the trial generally, there could have been further discovery of documents or inquiry relating to the issue. However,this is a factual issue that should and could have been easily raised by the 4th defendant, if it was a fact. Throughout the trial,the defendant did not raise this issue, nor was the issue raised in the Defence that was prepared by her then solicitors. Indeed,this issue would have been contrary to or very much inconsistent with the terms of the two "guarantees" and the allegations of herabsence of knowledge of the contents of the two legal charges executed by her that was raised in her Defence.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Mr Yau, based on the first two grounds of appeal, asks us to order a new trial so that, it is intimated, the 4th defendant wouldbe able to, on the basis of the two facility letters, go into a train of inquiry, so as to prove that the bank knew of the limitof exposure that the 4th defendant was willing to take in her execution of the two legal charges. However, the missing link, whichmakes the present case very different from the <strong>Fung Chin Kan</strong> case, is that even now before us, the 4th defendant does not say that there was an agreement between her and the 1st defendant orthe 2nd defendant that her liability resulting from the execution of the two legal charges was to be limited to $2.4 million and$8 million respectively. Such an agreement, if true, can be raised by the 4th defendant without any need of any further inquiry.In these circumstances, I do not consider that there was any substantial wrong or miscarriage at the trial for this Court to exerciseits power to order a new trial, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> and Order 59 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 11</a> of the Rules of the High Court.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground 2</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Ground 2 is also based on the two facility letters with a limit of banking facilities to be granted under the two legal charges.However, it was never alleged in the Defence that the bank had lent more money than the respective limits of $2.4 million and $8million under the two legal charges.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Moreover, Mr Ng, for the bank, has in his skeleton arguments drawn our attention to the evidence of Mr Yuen Chi-hung before the judge.Mr Yuen, a bank officer, told the judge that the 1st defendant's indebtedness did not "exceed the facilities limited granted to the1st defendant". The evidence was not challenged by the 4th Defendant. The judge accepted this evidence and said in his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"19. There is no evidence as to precisely when Senlaveer and Mr Cheung defaulted with the bank. But in June 1998 formal demand wasmade by the bank. The total amount of the facility had not been exceeded but the repayment terms were not being met."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Ground 2 asserts that there was a material variation of the agreement limiting the 4th defendant's liability to the detriment ofthe 4th defendant which discharged the two legal charges altogether. Factually, as I have held that there was no agreement betweenthe bank and the 4th defendant by way of construction and no agreement between the 1st defendant and the 4th defendant by way offact to limit her liability, there is no substance in this ground.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground 3</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The factual basis of the third ground of appeal is that the 4th defendant had on a number of occasions in about 1996 approached thebank to ask for the return of the title deeds. Mr Yau argues that this amounted to the 4th defendant giving notice of her intentionto terminate the two legal charges and her covenant to repay the indebtedness of the 1st defendant to the bank. Mr Yau complainsthat the judge made no mention or finding in relation to the 4th defendant's testimony about her approaches to the bank's staff MrChoi Sui Kwan (or Choi Suiqun) and Madam Wong Sau Ying to ask them for the return of the title deeds of her two properties. The 4thdefendant had also cross-examined Mr Choi when he denied her approaches to him. Mr Yau complains that judge did not resolve thisdispute of fact between the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is to be noted that this third ground of appeal is raised in, if I may say so, a strange manner. It states that the judge, throughno fault of his own, failed to consider whether in the circumstances of the evidence, that the bank owed the 4th defendant any dutyunder tort or contract to take such steps as might reasonably be necessary for the protection of the interest of the 1st defendantas the principal borrower, the 4th defendant as the guarantor (by way of her personal covenant to pay) and itself as creditor whenthe 4th defendant gave notice to it that she wanted to recall the guarantee/mortgage. This is not saying that the judge erred inany respect in his judgment. Nor was the point ever pleaded. The judge was therefore not incumbent to consider it.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Yau has not been able to cite any authority to support his contention that in the circumstances of this case, the bank owed aduty to assist the 4th defendant in obtaining a discharge of the two legal charges.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Moreover, the "guarantees" executed by the 1st defendant in favour of the 4th defendant contained a term to the effect that afterthe expiration of two years from the execution of the legal charges, based on which the bank granted banking facilities to the 1stdefendant, she was entitled to seek the assistance of the 1st defendant to require the bank to discharge the legal charges, if shewished to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In testimony, the 4th defendant did mention to the judge that sometime after mid-1995, she had asked the 2nd defendant to returnthe title deeds of her properties, through personal approaches and by letters. But the 2nd defendant did not give her any positivereply. In a situation like that in the present case, I cannot see any legal duty on the part of the bank, as the lender, towardsthe 4th defendant as the guarantor or mortgagor, to assist her to obtain a discharge of the guarantee or the mortgage, without thefull repayment of the loan lent pursuant to the mortgage/guarantee and interest. The mortgage/guarantee was provided to secure therepayment of the loan and interests, without the full repayment of which, there can be no duty imposed by law on the lender to havethe mortgage/guarantee discharged or to take any steps relating thereto. I consider that this ground of appeal has no merit and mustfail.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Cheung JA</strong>:</p>    <p>I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Chung J</strong>:</p>    <p>I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(K H Woo)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">(Peter Cheung)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Andrew Chung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Judge of the Court</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Kenneth W H Ng, instructed by Messrs Tsang, Chan &amp; Wong, for the Plaintiff.</p>        <p>Mr Albert K C Yau, instructed by Messrs Wong, Poon, Chan, Law &amp; Co, for the 4th Defendant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2003/312.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
