Faced with a striking-out application, the Plaintiff now seeks to discontinue the claim against bothDefendants and the only remaining issue is therefore one of costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Background of the case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On or about 9 April 2008, Mr Jack Cafferty, the 2nd Defendant in this action and a commentator on news and current affairs analysisprogramme, âThe Situation Roomâ, airing on the CNN and CNN International Television Programming Services, made the followingcomments during an exchange with the host, Mr Wolf Blitzer, in the course of a comparison between todayâs China to that of a fewdecades ago:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><i>âWell, I donât know if China is any different, but our relationship with China is certainly different.  We are in hock to theChinese up to our eyeballs because of the war in Iraq, for one thing.  Theyâre holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth ofour paper.  We are also running hundreds of billions of dollarsâ worth of trade deficits with them, as we continue to import theirjunk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food and export, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollara month to turn out the stuff that weâre buying from Wal-Mart.  So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed. I think they are basically the same bunch of goons and thugs that theyâve been for the last 50 yearsâ (âthe Comments</i><i>â).</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On or about 16 April 2008, CNN issued the following statement: âIt was not Mr Caffertyâs nor CNNâs intent to cause offenceto the Chinese people, and [CNN] would apologise to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this wayâ (âthe CNN Statementâ). In the statement, CNN also said that âMr Cafferty was offering his âstrong heldâ opinion of the Chinese Government, not Chinaâspeopleâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 29 April 2008, the 2nd Defendant received a letter from the Plaintiff referring to the CNN Statement and purporting to acceptCNNâs so-called âoffer to apologiseâ and demanding that an apology be made to the Chinese people.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The original Writ and Statement of Claim was issued by the Plaintiff on 16 April 2008.  In this pleading, the Plaintiff allegedthat the Defendants had committed the tort of defamation by publishing the Comments, and it claimed against the Defendants for variousrelief including the publication of an apology, an injunction to restrain the publication of further defamatory statements and damages. The Writ and the Statement of Claim was subsequently amended and re-filed with the court on 2 May 2008.  In the amended pleading,the Plaintiff introduced the so-called âcontractual claimâ and limited the relief claimed to one of publication of an apology.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 15 May 2008, a letter was sent from Mr Jim Walton, President of the CNN Worldwide, to Chinaâs Ambassador to the United States,officially apologising to the Chinese people, saying that CNN had the highest respect for Chinese people around the world and theorganisation had no doubt that Chinese people were offended by Mr Caffertyâs remarks made on 9 April 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The 1st Defendant acknowledged the proceedings on 19 May 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The 1st Defendantâs solicitors, Messrs Clifford Chance, sent a letter to the Plaintiff dated 22 May 2008 setting out the variousfundamental flaws with the claim.  In short: (a) as a matter of law, defamation proceedings cannot be brought by an individual purportingto represent a race or large group of individuals said to be defamed; and (b) the Plaintiff, as a corporate plaintiff, plainly hadno standing to represent the Chinese people in any event.  The Plaintiff was informed of the basis upon which the 1st Defendant wouldrely upon to apply to strike out its claim and was invited to agree to withdraw the action before further costs were incurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Pausing here, I must say that the 1st Defendantâs argument is sound.  The Plaintiff asserts that the Comments amount to libelagainst the Plaintiff amongst all âChinese on earthâ, as the Comments injured the reputation of all Chinese and tend to lowerall Chinese in the estimate of right-thinking members of the world.  However, the Plaintiff, being a limited company, can only maintainan action of libel or slander for any words which are calculated to injure its trading reputation or its business (see: <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander,</i> 10th ed., para. 8.16).  The Comments certainly did not refer to the Plaintiff in any way.  Even if the claim was brought by a Chinese,the claim would still be flawed as the law of defamation does not allow an individual to sue in respect of the words directed ata group (see: <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander,</i> 10th Ed., para. 7.9).  The Comments clearly referred to, as the Plaintiff pleads, âall Chinese on earthâ and not to the Plaintiffas an individual.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff replied on the same day.  It abandoned the defamation claim and asserted a claim based on a contract to apologise.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Messrs Clifford Chance replied on 23 May 2008, stating that the claim based upon breach of contract âwas equally, if not moredeficient as a matter of lawâ.  The Plaintiff was again informed of the 1st Defendantâs intention to strike out any part of theAmended Writ and Statement of Claim that was not withdrawn.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Again pausing here, I must say that I have great difficulty in understanding the basis of the so-called Plaintiffâs âcontractualclaimâ.  The claim is made on the basis that CNN made an offer to apologise in the CNN Statement published on 16 April 2008.  Byaccepting such offer, there was a valid contract between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant and the 1st Defendant should thereforeproceed to publish an apology pursuant to such agreement.  However, the CNN Statement, when properly construed, was an âapologyâand not an âoffer to apologiseâ, and clearly, it was not made with any intention of creating legal relationship.  Further, theCNN Statement was not addressed to nor did it in any way concern the Plaintiff, and there was also no consideration to support thealleged contract.  If the Plaintiffâs argument is correct, anyone who heard about the CNN Statement would have the standing tosue CNN for breach of contract.  This simply cannot be right.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff replied on the same day, proposing a joint application to the court to make a ruling as to whether there existed avalid binding contract to apologise between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant.  That letter also stated that: âIt serve[s] nopurpose to further ask for any apology since your client has apologised.â </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Messrs Clifford Chance wrote back on 28 May 2008, repeating that the Plaintiffâs claims were legally flawed and that the 1st Defendantwould proceed with a striking-out application unless the Plaintiff agreed to withdraw the action.  On 29 May 2008, the Plaintiffconfirmed that it would abandon the claim for defamation but it would proceed with the claim for breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The 1st Defendantâs summons for the striking-out application and the supporting affirmation were filed and served on 11 June 2008. The affirmation set out the various reasons why the claim was flawed.  That included the 1st Defendantâs case that the Plaintiffhad sued the wrong CNN entity.  According to the 1st Defendant, the 1st Defendant is not the CNN entity responsible for publishingthe Comments.  Another CNN entity, Cable News Network, Inc., is the producer of the CNN and CNN International (CNNI) television programmingservices on which the Comments were made.  Cable News Network, Inc. is a Delaware (USA) corporation, and it has no presence in HongKong.  It is also the 1st Defendantâs argument that the Plaintiff sued the 1st Defendant simply to avoid the requirement of applicationfor leave to serve the writ of summons out of jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  By a letter dated 16 June 2008, the Plaintiff acknowledged that: âwe now realise that we have sued the wrong entity.  On thisalone, the case should not be proceeded with any further.â  The letter also acknowledged that the Defendants âhad duly apologisedand this Action will end one way or the other way soonâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Pursuant to the directions given by Master R Lai dated 16 June 2008, the Plaintiff filed the Affirmation of Siu See Kong on 24 June2008.  The 1st Defendantâs affirmation in reply was filed and served on 8 July 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Plaintiff has not made any application to join the correct CNN entity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Considerations for the costs of the action</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It is not appropriate for me to say here whether it was right for Mr Cafferty to express the Comments about the Chinese people. To me, this is very much a political and diplomatic matter.  Further, taking into account the aforesaid legal principles statedin <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, there is simply no legal basis for the Plaintiff to succeed in an action for defamation against the Defendants or the US companyresponsible for the production of the relevant programme, and so the court is not the proper forum for the directors of the Plaintiffto air whatever grievances they might have about the incident.  Hence, costs should follow the event and the Plaintiff should payfor the costs of the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In withdrawing the action, the Plaintiff is actually asking the 1st Defendant to pay for its costs.  According to Mr Sui, counselfor the Plaintiff, the claim was withdrawn because the 1st Defendant was not the correct entity to be sued.  After the 1st Defendanthad disclosed the fact that the 1st Defendant was not responsible for the production of the relevant programme, the Plaintiff immediatelydiscontinued the action.  The Plaintiff had therefore acted reasonably and the 1st Defendant should therefore pay for its costs. With the greatest respect, this argument is wholly misconceived.  Firstly, the Plaintiff has not dealt with the merits of the claim. As I have mentioned above, the Plaintiff does not have a meritorious claim against the Defendants or the US company responsiblefor the production of the programme, and so misjoinder is a non-issue.  If the Plaintiff thinks that it has a valid claim againstthe US company responsible for the production of the programme, it can simply apply to join that company as a party in the proceedings,and yet the Plaintiff has not done so in the present case.  Secondly, it is the duty on the part of the Plaintiff to sue the correctdefendant, and any costs wasted by the misjoinder of party should be borne by the Plaintiff.  Hence, I wholly reject Mr Suiâs argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Further, I order the costs to be taxed on indemnity basis based on the following 4 reasons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Firstly, the Comments were clearly directed against the Chinese people, and I therefore cannot understand how the Plaintiff, beinga limited company, has the <i>locus</i> to sue in the present action.  The Plaintiff is a limited company with issued share capital of only $10,000, and so I have everyreason to believe that the present proceedings have been deliberately brought through a limited company to protect the underlyingindividuals from personal liability arising from any adverse costs order which may be made as a result of the bringing of such unmeritoriousclaim.  This is clearly an abuse of the process of the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Secondly, according to the Amended Statement of Claim, the only relief sought is an apology.  However, CNN had somewhat made anapology in the CNN Statement published on 16 April 2008, and I cannot understand why the Plaintiff still had to commence the presentaction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Thirdly, the Plaintiffâs claim is bound to fail.  Apparently, the only purpose for which these proceedings have been brought isto generate publicity for the Plaintiff and its shareholders and to embarrass CNN.  The Plaintiff invited a newspapers reporter toaccompany its representative when serving the writ, and the court therefore has reason to believe that the court process has beenused for improper collateral purpose, which again is an abuse of process.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Fourthly, as shown by the history of this case, the Plaintiff was given repeated advance warnings that a striking-out applicationwould be brought and was invited to discontinue its claim, but the Plaintiff nevertheless chose not to do so.  In my judgment, theconduct of the case on the part of the Plaintiff was very unreasonable, and I therefore order that the costs are to be paid on anindemnity basis. </p>     <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" height="15"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" height="15">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Sui See Chun, instructed by Messrs  Paul Kwong &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr James Wadham, of Messrs Clifford Chance, for the 1st Defendant</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2008/352.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
