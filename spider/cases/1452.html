name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The 4 plaintiffs commenced this action in April 2002 claiming (among other things) an order for possession of the suit propertyagainst the defendants.  The cause of action lies in trespass.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  There is also a claim in conversion concerning chattels inside the suit property.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The defendants (in effect, the 1<sup>st</sup>-named defendant, Madam Tam Muk Hing (â<i>Mdm Tam</i>â)) deny the claim and counterclaim that Mdm Tam acquired title by way of adverse possession of the suit property.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In short, the suit property is a portion of the empty space on the ground floor beside (and underneath) the staircase leading tothe upper floors of a building in Kimberley Street, Tsimshatsui (also called â<i>the said staircase</i>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Plaintiffsâ Case</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff (â<i>Mdm Kan</i>â) claims in essence that (either directly or through others) she has been occupying the suit property since about 1993 pursuantto a lease or licence granted by the other plaintiffs, the suit propertyâs registered co-owners.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The suit property, and a small portion of the pavement immediately in front of it, was first used by Mdm Kanâs former husband,Mr Ng Kam Wa (â<i>Ng</i>â), to operate a plumbing and electrical work business.  Mdm Kan began to operate a flower shop, called âLee Poâ (å©å¯¶), inFebruary 1993 when Ng went to the Mainland to start his business there.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Since about 1998 or 1999 to the end of 2001, Mdm Kan allowed Mdm Ng, the sister of Ng, to operate the flower shop.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Since an unknown date in January 2002, Mdm Tam started to trespass the suit property, using it to operate a flower shop called âLanYuenâ (è­è).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Defendantsâ Case</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mdm Tamâs son, one Mr Leung Siu Man (â<i>Leung</i>â) was a repairman.  Since the 1960âs, Leung has been operating a small electrical work and plumbing business underneath the saidstaircase.  Leungâs business also extended to the pavement immediately in front of the suit property.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Leung passed away in 1992 (when he was about 44 years old).  Mdm Tam then sold off the remaining inventory such as light bulbs andbatteries.  In about 1993, she started to run a flower shop at the same location until now.  Her shop is called âLan Yuenâ.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The suit property has never been occupied by Mdm Kan or anyone else.  From about 1992 to about 1998/1999, Mdm Tam allowed Mdm Kanto sell flowers in her shop.  Mdm Kan was replaced by Mdm Ng in about 1998/1999 until early 2002 (when Mdm Ng, who came from Macau,was arrested for breach of her conditions to stay in Hong Kong and repatriated).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Witnessesâ Credibility and Findings of Fact</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  4 witnesses testified at trial:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) for the plaintiffs, Mdm Kan;</p>        <p class="quote">(b)    for the defence:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  Mdm Tam;</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  Ms Lee;</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  Mr Lau (â<i>Lau</i>â).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Apart from the above, reference has been made by the defendants to the witness statement and affirmation of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff (â<i>Lui</i>â) who was one of the registered co-owners of the suit property before he passed away.  After his death, Luiâs claim continuesto be pursued by his widow, Mdm Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In gist, I accept the testimony of Mdm Kan to be truthful and reliable.  On the other hand, I do not accept Mdm Tamâs testimony. I find the testimony of Ms Lee and Lau to be unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(a)   Mdm Kan</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mdm Kanâs testimony follows essentially the plaintiffsâ case summarized above.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The defendants criticize her credibility based on the following matters.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  First, there is a discrepancy between Mdm Kanâs testimony and the account given by Lui.  According to Mdm Kan, after Leung passedaway in 1992, Ng obtained the permission of Lui to use the suit property and Mdm Tamâs permission to use the pavement in front(that is, Leungâs place of business) to run his own business.  However, Luiâs affirmation narrates that in 1993, he and the otherco-owners agreed to let the suit property to Mdm Kan for operating a flower shop.  Luiâs witness statement states that the co-ownerslet the suit property to Ng first and to Mdm Kan later.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I consider the above difference to be the result of incomplete memory on the part of Mdm Kan or Lui.  In fact, the difference showsthat both were trying their best to recount events which happened some years back.  I do not consider it an indication of dishonesty.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The same conclusion should be reached regarding the difference in the amount of monthly sum paid by Mdm Kan to Lui: one states thatit was $2,000 whereas the one states it was $1,500.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Secondly, Mdm Kan has testified to matters which do not appear in her witness statement or her affirmation:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) Mdm Kan said that Ng agreed to pay her $10,000 in 1998 or 1999 in exchange for Mdm Kan returning the flower shop to Ng (so thatNgâs sister, Mdm Ng, could operate it).  Mdm Kan testified that it was also agreed if Ng failed to pay the sum within 3 months,the flower shop would have to be returned to her.  The last-mentioned matter does not appear in Mdm Kanâs witness statement;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) further, Mdm Kanâs affirmation entirely omits to mentioned the alleged agreement, but claims that Mdm Kan handed the flowershop over to Mdm Ng because of her unavailability due to personal engagement.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The content of Mdm Kanâs witness statement is more detailed than her affirmation.  This is understandable in view that the affirmationwas prepared for the purpose of an application for an interlocutory injunction.  The time available for preparing the affirmationwas probably more limited.  Para. 19(2) above should be considered in that light.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As regards para. 19(1) above, Mdm Ngâs testimony about the agreement relating to the time for Ng to pay her $10,000 was elicitedby counsel during her cross-examination.  Moreover, her witness statement has in fact mentioned Ngâs failure to pay as promisedand the quarrel which ensued.  She also said in the witness statement she demanded Ng to return the shop.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Other points have also been raised by the defendants.  However, I regard them to be minor matters and will not set them out heresave to say they have been considered by me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(b)   Mdm Tam</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mdm Tam is about 89 years old.  Despite her relatively advanced age, she spoke with clarity and exhibited no hearing or comprehensionproblem.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Her testimony is also along the lines of the defendantsâ case summarized above.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In brief, I agree with the plaintiffs that her testimony is not to be believed for the following reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  One, Mdm Tamâs case is that, since about 1993 up to now, the suit property (and the pavement immediately in front) has alwaysbeen operated by her as a flower shop called âLan Yuenâ.  The photographs produced by the plaintiffs render that to be inherentlyimplausible.  Dates have been imprinted on some of the photographs.  It can be inferred they reflect the time when the photographswere taken.  I conclude that the photographs were mostly taken in the 1990âs (especially between 1993 and 1997) and they show theflower shop to have a signboard âLee Poâ.  Mdm Tam has not been able to explain this, except that she did not bother with thesignboard.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Two, Mdm Tam claims that, since about 1992, she permitted Ng to install a telephone in her shop.  She also permitted Mdm Kan toshare the suit property with her (also to sell flowers).  Since about 1998 or 1999, she permitted Mdm Ng to do the same.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  There is an agreed plan showing the approximate measurements of the area occupied by the flower shop.  The main portion of the shopis roughly 3 metres deep with a frontage of about 1.4 metres.  It is highly implausible two businesses selling the same type of goodscould be accommodated in such a small space for a sustained period of time.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The hawker licence of Mdm Tam shows the following address:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âKIMBERLEY ST. ON PAVEMENT [IN FRONT] OF NO. 22â</p>        <p class="quote">(éå·´å©è¡22èåè¡äººè·¯ä¸)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The area occupied by Mdm Tamâs business (1.3 metres x 0.3 meter) also appears on the licence.  Neither the address nor the areacan advance the defendantsâ case.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The hawker licence has to be considered in the following light:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) Mdm Tamâs testimony is in short that Leungâs business consisted basically of two wooden boxes; the larger one was placed onthe floor on top of a stand while the smaller one was hung on the wall (whether it was the external wall is unclear);</p>        <p class="quote">(b)    Mdm Tamâs hawker licence was âinheritedâ from the hawkerâs licence of Leung; she sought a change of the licenseeâsname to her after Leungâs death;</p>        <p class="quote">(c) Leungâs hawker licence dated 7 October 1983 shows the same address and area stated in para. 29 above.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The only piece of evidence which arguably may support the defendantsâ case is Leungâs business registration record.  The documentwas dated 2 March 1970 and bears an address:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â22, Kimberley New St., Stair-Case, Kln.â</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(éå·´å©æ°è¡22èæ¨æ¢¯å£)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is undisputed âKimberley New Streetâ refers to the same street.  But whether the reference to the said staircase in the recordactually meant a business located underneath it, or merely one located near it, is again unclear.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Three, it is not Mdm Tamâs case either Mdm Kan or Mdm Ng has made any payment for sharing the shop space.  She was unable to explainwhy she did not consider or seek payment from Mdm Kan or Mdm Ng.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Fourth, electricity bills in Ngâs name does not fit Mdm Tamâs case that Ng only used her shop for contact purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(c)   Ms Lee</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Ms Leeâs witness statement dated 10 March 2004 states the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âè­æ¨æ¶èåå­æ¢åæ°å¨ä¸åå¹´åå·²ç¶å¨éå·´å©è¡22èæ¨æ¢¯å£ç¶çé·è¹æ°´é»å·¥ç¨ â¦ â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Ms Lee testified to events which took place about 30 years ago, when she was about 8 to 10 years old.  Her testimony is to the effectLeung has had two wooden boxes placed at the entrance but he also has had a show-case placed underneath the said staircase.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I do not find her memory of where Leungâs business was located to be reliable.  Mdm Tam, who should have a better memory of hersonâs possessions, only mentioned the two boxes; she did not say Leung also possessed a show-case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(d)   Lau</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Lauâs witness statement dated 10 March 2004 also states the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âè­æ¨æ¶èåå­æ¢åæ°å¨ä¸åå¹´åå·²ç¶å¨éå·´å©è¡22èæ¨æ¢¯å£ç¶çé·è¹æ°´é»å·¥ç¨ â¦ â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, in a hand-written note dated 28 May 2002, Lau said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âé·è¹æ°´é»å·¥ç¨æ¢åæ°çåå¨éå·´å©è¡22èééåæ¾å¤å¹´ â¦ â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Chinese characters âééâ literally mean âdoor edgeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The common way of expressing something to be underneath a staircase in Cantonese is âæ¨æ¢¯åºâ.  Even âæ¨æ¢¯å£â may betaken to have the same meaning.  But the description given in Lauâs note militates against such meaning.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  For this reason, I do not consider Lau to be a reliable witness insofar as he insists that Leungâs business was located underneaththe said staircase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(e)   Findings of Fact</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Having considered the totality of the evidence (including my assessment of the witnessesâ testimony summarized above), the followingfacts are found:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) the suit property was possessed by Ng since about 1993 pursuant to a lease or licence granted by the co-owners including Lui;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Ng also obtained Mdm Tamâs permission to occupy the pavement in front of the suit property around the same time;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Mdm Kan took over the said premises from Ng shortly later and commenced operating her flower shop âLee Poâ;</p>        <p class="quote">(4) Mdm Kan handed the shop over to Mdm Ng in about 1998 or 1999 on condition Ng should pay her $10,000;</p>        <p class="quote">(5) despite his promise, Ng failed to do so and Mdm Kan kept on demanding him to return the shop to her;</p>        <p class="quote">(6) Mdm Ng was arrested by the police and left the shop in February 2002;</p>        <p class="quote">(7) Leung and Mdm Tam did not occupy the suit property since the 1960âs but only occupied the pavement nearby, running first a plumbingand electrical work business and then a flower-vendorâs business.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Legal Principles</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The legal principles relating to adverse possession are undisputed.  In essence, they are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) there must be factual possession signifying an appropriate degree of physical control: <i>Powell v. McFarlane</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%2038%20P%20%26%20CR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 38 P &amp; CR 452</a>;</p>        <p class="quote">(b)    there must be the requisite intention to possess: <i>Wong Tak Yue v.

I conclude that they have failed to doso.  On the other hand, I am satisfied that Mdm Kan has established her claim.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Judgment should be entered in Mdm Kanâs favour in the terms set out below.  Save as regards costs (see paras. 50 to 56 below),no order will be made in relation to the other plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The counterclaim is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Relief</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(a)   Possession</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  An order for possession of the area depicted in the agreed plan should be made.  The precise term of the order for possession shouldbe agreed between the parties or, failing agreement, as approved by the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(b)   Damages for Trespass</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I am satisfied that mesne profits should be assessed at $2,000 per month, being the amount agreed to between Lui and Mdm Kan.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Mesne profits should be payable by the defendants from January 2002 to the delivery up of vacant possession of the suit property.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(c)   Conversion of Chattels</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I agree with the defendants that there is no reliable evidence of ownership of the chattels.  For that reason, I am not preparedto award nominal damages (which is what the plaintiffs seek) under this head of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(d)   Injunction Orders</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  There is no indication at present the defendants will not comply with the order for possession.  No injunction order is grantedat this stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Costs Order</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Subject to paras. 51 and 52 below, the parties agree that the usual rule that costs should follow the event is applicable.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The defendants argue in their written supplemental closing submission that a plaintiff must have an immediate right of possessionin order to successfully ground an action in trespass (see also <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (2006)19<sup>th</sup> Ed., para. 19-10).</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Having granted a lease or licence in Mdm Kanâs favour, the defendants contend that Lui, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs lack sufficient interest to bring this action.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The defendantsâ above contentions are only raised during closing submission stage.  Their pleadings never make that distinction. In fact, their counterclaim is brought against the plaintiffs <i>en bloc</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The defendants fairly admit that no practical benefit would be obtained by them even if the above contentions are accepted by thecourt.  They are still liable to deliver up the suit property to Mdm Kam.  The contentions are therefore in the context of this actionâtechnicalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  By reason of the matters set out in paras. 53 and 54 above, it is unfair to award costs against the âtechnicallyâ unsuccessfulplaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  There will accordingly be the following costs order.  No order is made as regards costs incurred for the exclusive benefit of theunsuccessful plaintiffs.
