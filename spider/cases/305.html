There have been no formal pleadingssubmitted by the plaintiff although there has been a formal defence and counter-claim filed by the defendant. However, at the hearingMiss Remedios representing the defendant elected not to pursue a counterclaim.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff educated in the U.S.A was qualified as an attorney and presented his case in person. In view of the way in which thiscase came before me by way of transfer from the Small Claims Tribunal, I did not concern myself with what would be irregularitiesin pleading, in fact Miss Remedios no doubt motivated by the same considerations expressly did not elect to take any pleading points,and I am indebted to her for the way in which she for purposes of answering plaintiff's claim marshalled the various heads of claimsought to be relied on by him.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff gave evidence that two days before the tour was scheduled to take place he called at defendant's offices, and spoketo a Mr. Fung to enquire about joining this tour. In his evidence, the plaintiff claimed that he specifically checked on two matters.First what were the travel documents required? Secondly, whether the company had obtained tickets for the non-stop Canton-Hung Homtrain? He was handed a copy of an itinerary. A further matter of importance to the plaintiff was that wild animal food was one ofthe blandishments offered by the defendant and he asserted that this was of importance to him. In evidence he claimed not to havereceived any such food although there was evidence adduced by the defence as to a dish being served of "fruit eating fox".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I am prepared to accept that in his agitation arising out of matters which I shall traverse later the plaintiff may not have noticedany distinctive wild animal food dish placed before him, indeed such a dish may to the uninitiated bear a resemblance to dishes orrather a dish with which he may have been familiar. One need only draw on one's own experience in observing those eating, say rabbitor snake, for the first time and not being informed of the nature of the meat concerned. Accordingly, I do not propose to attributeany significance to this in relation to his claims.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff claimed that he was told by a representative of the defendant that he needed to take only his Hong Kong Re-entry Permitand his Entry Permit into China and that at no time was he informed that he should take with him his Hong Kong Identity Card, thisas he later found out being essential.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The itinerary followed an advertisement seen by him which had drawn his attention to the defendant's services and based on a "representationand the itinerary I entered into the contract".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I would add that Mr. Fung when giving evidence for the defendant said that at the material time, the defendant was "a special customer",he explained this was caused by the defendant booking for two persons, that he paid in full in advance and did not elect to attenda tea-party the evening before departure as did most people upon joining such a tour party.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff during cross-examination asserted that because of his travel experience in the U.S.A. and Canada he always made enquiriesas to the travel documentation required.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On the 1st August the plaintiff and his companion, Miss Chan, arrived at the Hong Kong - Macao Wharf shortly after 7 a.m. intendingto board a jet-foil which was to leave after 8.00 a.m. About 8 a.m. he went through Immigration and was told then that he neededhis Hong Kong Identity Card, he having left his at home, according to his evidence, deliberately. The plaintiff immediately informedthe tour leader, a Miss Leung, of the position and asked her what he should do. She suggested that he go home (Pokfulam) and obtainhis Identity Card and that he should rejoin the group in Macao, this the plaintiff proceeded to do and he obtained the next availableboat to Macao which happened to be a hydrofoil arriving, as I understand the evidence, at a different Pier at Macao.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Meanwhile, Miss Margaret CHAN Yuk-lan travelling on the jetfoil had, as she related in evidence, a conversation with the tour leaderand a Mr. Koo, someone apparently "with influence" with the tour company who came and talked to Miss Leung and said that arrangementsfor Miss Chan to wait for Mr. Lee the plaintiff, at the border were "improper". Some discussion in Punti took place and at its conclusionthey asked her to wait for Mr. Lee at the Macao Wharf saying that after she had met him a member of the travel company's staff wouldtake them to join the tour, this at the border. She fell-in with this suggestion and waited at the Macao Wharf taking care of twopieces of luggage. There were of course a number of people disembarking.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Miss Chan waited at the jet-foil pier whilst plaintiff in hot pursuit is a hydrofoil arrived at a different pier. This aspect ofthe whole disastrous (to the plaintiff) episode was described in her closing submission by Miss Remedios as a "merry muddle".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiff arrived at Macao and leaving his pier, obtained the services of a taxi and then proceeded with all despatch to thefrontier. where he went through Customs and Immigration officials representing both Macao and China, and met the group. When he firstsaw the tour leader, she asked where his friend was, he asked what happened, upon which Miss Leung replied "she had told my friendto wait for me at Macao - Hong Kong Wharf". The plaintiff asked Miss Leung to come with him. She said "this was impossible". I wouldadd in passing that the tour leader at this stage obviously had the dilemma of electing to stay with her tour group or going withthe plaintiff to find the one "lost lamb". I add that the plaintiff had been through the border backwards and forwards, a total ofthree times without finding his friend and luggage.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> After speaking to Miss Leung, the plaintiff once again went through the Customs and Immigration checks returning to Macao. One cannothelp but he impressed by, the way in which the plaintiff was able to pursuade the officers to allow him through so quickly and also,with the obvious sympathy and understanding extended to him by officials from both jurisdictions. The plaintiff returned to MacaoFerry and found Margaret Chan who was accompanied by a representative of the defendant company. They boarded a taxi again, and travelledback to the border where plaintiff once again checked through Customs, as did Miss Chan for the first time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiff obtained his documents back from the Chinese officials, he having left these with them. The tour group was not waitingfor them, so as plaintiff had the itinerary, they went to the next stop, hiring a taxi operating within the peoples Republic of China,this after discussion with the representative of the tour company. Reimbursement for this taxi journey has been made by the defendantcompany.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Meanwhile the tour party had travelled on an unscheduled side trip this to placate the other members of the group while Miss Leungwas trying arrange for them to wait for the plaintiff and his companion to show up.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> After plaintiff was reunited with the group, the tour proceeded according to the itinerary, until the 4th August when they returnedto Hong Kong. The return journey was by way of train which stopped at Lo Wu when passengers disembarked, went through Immigrationand joined the Lo Wu-Hung Hom train. There was a discrepancy in the evidence here, plaintiff claiming that some considerable timewas spent at the border, Miss Leung on the other hand asserting that the time spent was only some 10 or 15 minutes. Also the plaintiffclaimed that he and Miss Chan lad to stand from Canton to Lo Wu whilst it was assented by Miss Leung that members of the group hadto stand only on the Hong Kong part of the journey.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It may be that the plaintiff's memory was at fault in this regard.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was common ground that the tour group was to make a tour by coach of Canton during the morning of the 4th, but that because ofthe change of train, this had to be cancelled and as stated by Miss Leung a substitute tour was arranged for the evening of the 3rd,but not many tourists availed themselves of this opportunity as they wished to shop. The plaintiff asserted that he did not hearof this substituted tour which Miss Leung said was announced at dinner on the evening of the 3rd.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It appears that normally bookings are made by the defendant with the Chinese travel Authorities to travel by the express train, buttickets, are not issued until the party arrives at Canton and on this occasion the defendants had not been told of the change untilthe evening of the 3rd August.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is obvious that other members of the tour party felt rancour over that I believe to be a serious curtailment of the tour, resultingin very considerable loss of enjoyment for all those partaking. Accordingly the defendant ordered two tables for supper for the 10thAugust and hosted the tour party or rather those wishing to attend, at a cost of $2,360 at Hong Kong and Kowloon Diamond Restaurant,Lung Kee Building. The plaintiff and Miss Chan elected not to attend this banquet.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The itinerary handed to the plaintiff when he made his arrangements and entered into the contract with the defendant on about a the30th July contained the following information or conditions under the general head "responsibilities"-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</td>            <td width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">                1.

The gravamen of their evidence being that Miss Leung explained that therecould be alterations to travel arrangements because the Chinese Authorities had complete control, these matters being beyond thecontrol of the company. Mr. Fung said that this was standard advice given, and it is found to be necessary, because on one previousoccasion the defendant company had found that a tour group had to return with its journey broken at Lo Wu, rather than as arrangedby the express train.</p>    <p>   </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> I don't need to traverse the evidence adduced by the defendants in any detail. Miss Leung denied that it was she who suggested thatMiss Chan wait at Macao Pier for the plaintiff, asserting that this was something Miss Chan did of her own volition. The events atthe border including the side trip undertaken by the tour party while waiting for the plaintiff and Miss Chan were described by MissLeung as were the discussions she had with the plaintiff upon his arrival at Shek Kee China Travel Association.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Miss Chan gave evidence for the plaintiff, I was most impressed with her and believed her to be completely honest and possessed ofcomplete and accurate recall.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I was also impressed with the plaintiff although I believe he may have at time been rather abrasive in his relations with the servantsand agents of the defendant company.

The defendant did not claim to have the required skill and competence togive advice or to exercise the necessary diligence to give reliable advice.</p>    <p>   </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> A majority of the Privy Council held that the only duty owed to Evatt was to give him an honest answer to his inquiries.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> In the instant case, I believe that Travel Agents holding out that they arrange tours, have as a consequence, a duty to advice onarrangements made for both individuals and tour groups as to what documentation is required to enable their clients to traverse frontiers,including Visas end such other documents sufficient to enable their clients to enter the country to which the agent has arrangedfor them to travel, together with such documentation as would enable the tourists to return to their. country of origin, in the instantcase, Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> In my view, accepting the plaintiff's evidence as I have the defendant was negligent in not advising Mr. Lee that he had to havewith him his Hong Kong Identity Card, together with his Re-entry Permit into Hong Kong and his Entry Permit into China.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The economic loss sustained by the plaintiff was his taxi fares from Macao Pier to Pokfulam and return. There was no loss sustainedin respect of his jet-foil ticket he having been supplied this by Miss Leung, as part of his package. The taxi fare to the borderof Macao and China from the pier were incurred and the Company would be liable for taxi fares within the People's Republic of Chinawhich fares have already been paid.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I believe the amount claimed for the round trip between Hong Kong Macao Wharf and plaintiff's residence at Pokfulam Road, at $15to be a reasonable amount.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Plaintiff complained about his holiday being spoiled and also that he suffered loss of enjoyment from annoyance conveyed to him byother tourists in the party.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In considering what flows from defendant's negligent advice one must take into account the change which occurred on board the jetfoilwhen Miss Chan agreed to wait at Macao Wharf Pier. It was this which primarily brought about the plaintiff's loss of enjoyment ashe went to the border and through the customs formalities while she was still waiting at the Pier. Had he met her as arranged theywould have caught up with the tour party and not lost any appreciable time and suffered minimal if any inconvenience or loss of enjoyment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> In my view the "loss of enjoyment" under this head attributable to defendant's negligence is minimal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(b) <u>Plaintiff's claim as founded in Contract</u></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> In <u>Jarvis v. Swans Tours Ltd.</u> <sup>(3)</sup> Lord Denning held in respect of a claim for a spoil holiday that ''...it is not necessary to decide whether they were representationson warranties because since the Misrepresentation Act 1967 there is a remedy in damages for misrepresentation as well as for breachof warranty".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I observe that Lord Denning's approach has not fount favour in some academic circles, it being postulated that the distinction betweendamages in Contract and Tort does not seem to have been appreciated.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In the circumstances with which I have to deal I adopt Lord Denning's approach, this in view of the enactment of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284">Cap.284</a>. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(3)</a> equates to Section 2(3) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (H.K.) which section has been said to provide the only "dim clue" to thetest to be applied in assessing Damages.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> I am in no doubt that the statements made on behalf of the defendant relating to the return journey Canton - Hong Kong in the circumstancesas accurately and truthfully described by the plaintiff amounted at the least to misrepresentation and accordingly any damages incurredby the plaintiff must be made good by the defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(c) <u>Damages for Miss Chan's loss of enjoyment</u></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Miss Chan was accompanied the plaintiff, he having entered into the contract for the tour on her behalf. As in <u>Jackson v. Horrison Holidays Ltd.</u><sup>(4)</sup>. The plaintiff is not a trustee for Miss Chan but nevertheless following that case I hold that Mr. Lee can recover damages not onlyfor the diminution in the value of the holiday and the discomfort vexation and disappointment which he himself has suffered, butalso for the discomfort, vexation and disappointment suffered by Miss Chan. I appreciate I an extending the principle expressed inthe case referred to from wife and children to a travelling companies outside the bounds of wedlock, however to me the importantcriteria were that the plaintiff:-</p>    <table border="0" width="94%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="86%" valign="top">                entered into the contract on Miss Chan's behalf, and                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="86%" valign="top">they travelled as a unit within the larger unit of the tour group.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>(d) <u>Exemption Clause</u></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Any clause which is intended to provide a contracting party with a means of evading liability in tort or contract must be expressedclearly and without ambiguity, otherwise it will be ineffective.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It must clearly state what the intention is. <u>Hollier v. Rambler Motors (AML) Ltd.</u><sup>(7)</sup> is an example where a garage owner was liable for loss or damage due to its own negligence despite an attempt to provide exemptionby using the words "...not responsible for damage caused by fire to customers cars on the premises".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Per Salman L.J. where a party "wants to include in it (a contract) a term exempting himself from liability for his own negligence.To be effective that term must sufficiently clearly convey that it is liability for negligence which is being excluded".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> To this I would add misrepresentation or breach of warranty.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In the instant case the terms of the contract, as earlier quoted, do not in my view exempt the defendant, from liability for itsown negligence or its misrepresentation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(e) <u>Measure of Damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> As earlier stated the damage caused by reason of the negligent advice is minimal. In respect of the misrepresentation the plaintiffhad his holiday cut short by the best part of a half day - which time was to be spent touring Canton. This created great deal ofvexation and disappointment, also there was discomfort experienced at the border - Hong Kong-China and in respect of the train journeywithin this territory.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> My award for general damages is to include damages claimed as itemised in heads 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the letter dated 11th August, 1980from the plaintiffs then solicitors to the defendant. I disallow the toll call Canton Hong Kong as an item of special damage. Theother items of special damage were not contested as to quantum but only as to liability. Miss Chan suffered the sane discomforts,vexation and disappointment.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>CONCLUSIONS</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I award to the plaintiff damages as follows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top">Special damages</td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="48%" valign="top">round trip, taxi Hong Kong-Macao Wharf</td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$15</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="48%" valign="top">Taxi fares within Macao</td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                <p style="text-align:right">$25</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="48%" valign="top">Telephone calls Kung Pei-Shekki</td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                $8                <p>___</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="48%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$48</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top">General damages</td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="48%" valign="top">Negligent advice</td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$75</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="48%" valign="top">Misrepresentation</td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"><u>$800</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="48%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$875</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top">Total</td>            <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="48%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$923</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="48%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">====</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" height="18"></td>            <td width="50%" height="18" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(B.T.
