At the materialtimes, Asher Model was a management consultant to a private club called âHei Heiâ situated in Central with a liquor licence.  Mr Carroll was the senior inspector police commanding the Miscellaneous Enquiry sub-unit (the ME unit) of the Central Divisionof the Hong Kong Police, which conducted licence checks in the area.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Mr Carroll now applies to strike out Asher Modelâs claim for being frivolous and vexatious, and being an abuse of process.  Theapplication is premised on the following principal grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) In light of the evidence presented now, Asher Modelâs claim is bound to fail, as it could never establish at trial the variousmaterial pleas of misfeasance.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"> 2) For the same reasons, the claim is brought without <i>bona fides</i> and with an ulterior motive only to put pressure on Mr Carroll and the ME unit.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) In any event, the claim is also bound to fail, as there could not be effective causation between Asher Modelâs alleged lossand the alleged misfeasance.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) The claim is similarly bound to fail, as Mr Carroll has a complete defence based on the doctrine of <i>ex turpi causa</i>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">It is pertinent to note that it is <i>not</i> Mr Carrollâs case that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In order to understand these grounds of striking out in proper context, it is necessary for me to set out the essential backgroundfacts and Asher Modelâs pleaded claim as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Background</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Hei Hei was the trading name of a company known as Junart Ltd, and was a music club and restaurant situated at 3rd Floor, On HingBuilding near Lan Kwai Fong, Central.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Asher Model was the contracted management company of Hei Hei for a term of one year from 15 December 2006 to 14 December 2007. Under the contract, Asher Model was paid a monthly management fee of $50,000.00, but Hei Hei was entitled to terminate the contractif they could not maintain the liquor licence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  At the material time, the liquor licence granted to Hei Hei carried a condition that at any time, its premises should not have morethan 172 persons, staff and customers included.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It is Asher Modelâs case that, between June 2006 and June 2007, the ME unit had carried out 45 times licence checks at Hei Hei. Hei Hei was found to be in breach of the special condition on a number of occasions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 12 June 2007, the liquor licensing board heard Hei Heiâs application for renewal of the liquor licence.  The police opposedthe application.   The licensing board eventually refused the application, apparently on the basis that Hei Hei had been in repeatedbreaches of the special condition. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As a result of the non-renewal of the liquor licence, Hei Hei closed down its operation in June 2007.  At the same time, Junartterminated the management contract with Asher Model.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Asher Model now says its damage in the form of the loss of management fees for the remainder of the management contract (in thesum of $322,580.65) was caused by Mr Carrollâs misfeasance in public office.  The complaint is that, motivated by a malice againstHei Hei and Asher Model, Mr Carroll had exercised his power in commanding the ME unit to conduct licence checks with such frequencyand in such a manner to target at Hei Hei to ensure its closure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The alleged misfeasance and malice are materially pleaded at paragraphs 15 to 18 of the Statement of Claim, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="650">            <tr>                <td width="38" valign="top">                    <p style="text-align:justify">â15.</p>                </td>                <td colspan="3" valign="top" width="602">                    <p style="text-align:justify">The Plaintiffâs aforesaid loss of profit is caused and/ or contributed to by the Defendant who maliciously exercised its power asa public officer that caused damage to the Plaintiff.

The Court has to apply âcommon senseâ to decide which one or ones of these facts constitute the effective or dominant causeof the loss, and which one or ones merely provide the opportunity for the loss to occur.

And,prior to the introduction of the legislation providing for apportionment of liability, the need to identify what was the âeffectivecauseâ of the relevant damage reinforced the notion that a question of causation was one of fact and, as such, to be resolved bythe application of common sense.  Commentators subdivide the issue of causation in a given case into two questions:  the questionof causation in fact â to be determined by the âbut forâ test â and the further question whether a defendant is in law responsiblefor damage which his or her negligence has played some part in producing â¦ It is said that, in determining this second question,considerations of policy have a prominent part to play, as do accepted value judgments: see <i>Fleming</i>, p. 173.  However, this approach to the question of causation (a) places too much weight on the âbut forâ test to the exclusionof the âcommon senseâ approach which the common law has always favoured, and (b) implies, or seems to imply, that value judgmenthas, or should have, no part to play in resolving causation as an issue of fact.  As Dixon CJ, Fullagar and Kitto JJ. remarked in<i>Fitzgerald v Penn</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 268</a>, 277 âit is all ultimately a matter of common senseâ and âin truth the conception in question (i.e., causation) is not susceptibleto reduction of a satisfactory formula.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In the premises, the question of causation is generally a question of facts, which requires the Court to apply largely common senseto determine.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Discussion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Ground 1: It is impossible for Asher to prove their allegations of misfeasance at trial in light of the evidence presently produced</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Eric Ko, Government Counsel acting for Mr Carroll, submits that with the evidence now provided by Mr Carroll through his fouraffidavits filed, it is clear and obvious that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) In relation to the allegations pleaded at paragraph 15(a) of the Statement of Claim, there were good and well justified groundsfor the ME unit to make more frequent licence checks at Hei Hei than at the other clubs.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Asher Model cannot prove the allegation set out at paragraph 15(b) of the Statement of Claim, that all or most of the checks wereconducted in the absence of any complaints made by the public.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) Asher Model cannot prove the allegations set out at paragraphs 15(c) and/or (d) of the Statement of Claim, that Hei Hei was usuallythe first club to be visited for the licence checks carried out in the district or at On Hing Terrace.

As such, Asher Modelâsclaim of misfeasance based on the higher number of checks made at Hei Hei is unarguable, and therefore bound to fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Given Mr Koâs submissions that these letters provide clear and obvious evidence to render Asher Modelâs pleaded allegationsbeyond proof, for a proper discussion, I believe it is necessary for me to set out the relevant parts of the letters as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) In a letter dated 7 March 2008 signed by Divisional Commander, it says:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThis further certifies that the number of licence checks led by the ME Unit at Hei Hei between 9<sup>th</sup> June 2006 and 5<sup>th</sup> May 2007 was justified in view of the nature and the extent of adverse cases reported by the public and Hei Hei Clubâs licencebreaches disclosed during licence checks led by the ME Unit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) In relation to the public complaints, in the letter dated 18 May 2007 issued by the police to Hei Heiâs former solicitors, itsays as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI refer to your letter dated 9<sup>th</sup> May 2007 and take this opportunity to advise you that in the period between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2005 and 14<sup>th</sup> April 2007 a total of 73 incidents involving the Hei Hei Club (both of a criminal and miscellaneous nature) have been recorded bythe Police.  This figure far surpasses the number of reports involving other problematic premises in the vicinity and for this reasonthe Hei Hei Club has, and will continue to be, closely monitored by the Police.  You should also note that more recent checks ofthe Club have disclosed a number of cases of overcrowding which tends to suggest that, notwithstanding the recent imposition of a3-month liquor licence, your clients are intent on continuing to flaunt the conditions of the licence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) In the policeâs follow-up letter dated 25 May 2007 to Hei Heiâs former solicitor, it also says as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><b>â</b>With respect to your comments concerning the number of reported incidents involving the Hei Hei Club please be advised that, withonly a very few exceptions, these reports involve crime and other miscellaneous complaints that have been made by <u>individual members</u> of the public, and <u><strong>not</strong></u> reports that have been generated as a result of the enforcement action carried out by the police during the course of their licencingchecks.  In other words, the frequency with which a premiseâs [sic] is checked has little bearing on the number of reports thatwe may receive from the members of the public and, as such, does not explain the large differential that exits when reports involvingyour clientâs club are compared with reports involving other clubs in the vicinity.   That said, in order to avoid any possibilityof a misunderstanding, you are also advised that the total number of reports received <u>will</u> be a determining factor in deciding whether or not there is a need for a particular premises to be closely monitored by the police;and if it is felt that there is such a need (as is the case with the Hei Hei Club) we will increase the frequency of our inspectionsaccordingly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Ko submits that these letters as evidence are effectively conclusive on the reasons for the increased licence checks made atHei Hei, as there is nothing to show that they are not reliable and correct.  Further, it is difficult, as submitted by Mr Ko, toimagine that the writers of these letters would not be telling the truth, as they would be subject to disciplinary proceedings andthe risk of losing their pensions if they do not do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  With respect to Mr Ko, I do not accept that these letters constitute at this early and interlocutory stage such clear and obviousevidence to show that Asher Model would not be able to prove its allegation at trial. My reasons are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) These are letters that set out only the broad summary of certain underlying information or documents (i.e, the public reportsand complaints of Hei Hei).  It also sets out the views of the writers on the comparison between the number of reports made againstHei Hei and that against the other clubs in the same district. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) As such, they are not primary documents giving the information, and I do not think the Court is in a position at this stage tosay summarily that Asher Model should be shut out from making any attempt to challenge the letters at trial.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) I fully note Mr Koâs submissions that there are apparently no or no good reasons for the writers not to have set out the correctfacts on these letters.  However, the contents of the letters may well be subject to challenge, which has nothing to do with thewritersâ credibility.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) Given this is only at the early and interlocutory stage of the proceedings, where discovery has not even started, I do not thinkit is appropriate for me to set out in detail what I regard as the potential aspects of the evidence that could be subject to challengeor cross-examination at trial.  Suffice for me to say that I am not satisfied that these letters constitute conclusive evidence forthe present purpose as submitted by Mr Ko.  I would cite two examples of what I see as the non-conclusive nature of these letters<i>at this stage</i>. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5) First, as pointed by Mr Danny Ng (counsel for Asher Model), which I accept, the public reports referred to in the two lettersmade in May 2007 does not relate squarely with the relevant 12 mothsâ period complained by Asher Model (ie., June 2006 to June2007).  Those public reports fall within a 27 monthsâ period between January 2005 and April 2007.  There is however nothing toshow the distribution of the public reports incident over these 27 monthsâ period.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said atthis stage that this constitutes clear and obvious evidence to show that the increased licence checks over the relevant complaintperiod must be related to the large number public reports made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6) Further, Asher Modelâs case is premised on comparing the higher number of licence checks carried out at Hei Hei against thosemade at the other clubs.  As such, and without seeing the primary evidence of the number of visits and the public reports made againstthe other clubs, the Court cannot in my view at this stage say that these letters clearly and obviously show that Asher Model doesnot have an arguable to prove at trial. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I therefore do not accept that for the present purpose, it is clear and obvious that Asher Model would not be able to establishat trial the allegation pleaded at paragraph 15(a) of the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Paragraph 15(b) of the Statement of Claim</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  This plea alleges that all or most of the licence checks were conducted in the absence of any public complaints or reports.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Ko for Mr Carroll relies on the same letters discussed above, and submits that Asher Model would not be able to establish theplea at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  For the same reasons I have given above, I again do not accept that at this stage, the letters constitute such evidence that makesit so clear and obvious that Asher Model would not be able to establish its pleaded allegation even if there is a trial. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Paragraphs 15(c) and (d) of the Statement of Claim</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Asher Modelâs case under this plea is that, whenever there was a licence check carried out at the clubs at the Central Districtand at On Hing Terrace by the ME unit, Hei Hei was the first one to be visited in all or most of these occasions.

This is so because (a) the following evidenceshows conclusively that the circumstances justified Hei Hei should be monitored more closely by licence checks, and (b) in any event,Mr Carroll did not have the power to decide which club to be checked first at the various operations:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) In a letter dated 2 January 2008 issued by the Divisional Commander of the Central Division to Mr Carroll, it is stated as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWith specific regard to On Hing Building (âthe Buildingâ), Hei Hei Club was normally, but not always, the first club/restaurantto be visited of the 4 liquor licenced premises situated therein.  On occasions, other liquor licenced premises in the Building werevisited during Police operations which did not include visits to Hei Hei Club.  It is noteworthy that unlike Hei Hei Club whose liquorlicence was never on full term (i.e. 1 year) since its opening in 2004 and which was further shortened from 6-month term to 3-monthterm since 14<sup>th</sup> December 2006, all other liquor licenced premises in the Building were on full-term liquor licence prior to your appointment as thecommander of [the ME Unit].  A liquor licenced premises on less than full-term <i>may</i> generally require closer monitoring by the Liquor Licensing Board and the Police than those on full-term.  It should further be notedthat of the violence-related cases recorded by Police with respect to the liquor licensed premises in the Building during the RelevantPeriod, 50% were attributable to Hei Hei Club.  It is clear that it is the frequency of violence-related activities and the frequencyand seriousness of the breaching of licensing condition that, <i>inter alia</i>, dictate the manner of the liquor licence operations in the Building.â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) In a letter dated 15 April 2008 from the Division Commander to Mr Carroll, it is stated as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis also serves to certify that in the 7 licence check operations led by the ME Unit under your command during the Relevant Period,Hei Hei Club was the first liquor licensed premises to be inspected in Lan Kwai Fong on only 2 occasions.

If Hei Hei were not in repeated breachesof the special condition, the liquor licence would not have been lost no matter how many times and in which way the club was visitedwith the licence checks.  Mr Ko therefore submits that the complained licence checks only provided the opportunity for Asher Modelâsloss to occur, but did not cause it.  Thus, Asher Model could never prove causation even if it could prove at trial the underlyingallegations concerning the licence checks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Danny Ng for Asher Model submits that the complained misfeasance <i>prima facie</i> satisfies the âbut forâ test for the purpose of causation.  He says, but for the increased numbers and manner in which the complainedlicence checks were carried out by the ME unit, Hei Hei would not have been repeatedly caught in breach of the special condition. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the circumstances, Mr Ng further submits, either or both  of the alleged misfeasance and the breach of special conditions couldwell be regarded as the effective cause of Asher Modelâs loss.  This however is ultimately a question of fact, which the Courtshould and could only decide after the trial, but not at the present interlocutory stage.  For example, as contended by Mr Ng, ifit is found after trial that the number of licence checks levelled at Hei Hei is significantly more than that at the other clubsin the area, and that was done without justification and good reasons but only with the malice targeted at Hei Hei and Asher Model,the Court cannot rule out at this stage the possibility that the misfeasance would be found by the trial judge as one of the effectivecauses to Asher Modelâs loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In support of his submissions, Mr Ng also draws my attention to the case of <i>Three Rivers</i> where both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords were of the view that, as the question of causation is a question of fact,even if one were to assume all the facts pleaded in the statement of claim were established, the question was still not fit to bedecided as a preliminary issue but should be left to be canvassed after trial.  See:  <i>Three Rivers</i>, supra, pp 60H-61A <i>per</i> Hirst LJ, 166D-F <i>per</i> Auld LJ, 194B-C, <i>per</i> Lord Steyn, 247A-B <i>per</i> Lord Hope.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Given the principles in causation set out in paragraphs 18 to 20 above, and that the pleaded case is targeted malice, I accept MrNgâs submissions that it is inappropriate for the Court to decide summarily at this stage that causation cannot be proved.  Thisis a question of facts, which depends on the extent and the manner in which the facts concerning the allegations are eventually proved,if so proved, at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I therefore refuse to strike out the claim on this ground also.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Ground 4: The doctrine of <i>ex turpi causa</i></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The effective principle behind this doctrine is that no one is entitled to ground a claim on his own illegality or illegal conducts.See: <u>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</u>, <i>supra</i>, paras 3-04 â 3-07.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr Ko submits that as Asher Model has to plead and rely on the breach of the special condition of the liquor licence (which eventuallyled to the termination of its management contract), it has to rely on an illegality to complete and succeed in its claim.  The doctrineof <i>ex turpi causa</i> therefore applies and Asher Model is bound to fail in its claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  However, the âillegalityâ that Asher Model has to rely on in this case was committed by Junart (the liquor licence holder) butnot Asher Model (which was the management consultant).  It is thus at least arguable that Asher Model therefore is not relying onits own illegality or illegal conduct to advance its claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr Ko contends that as Asher Model and Junart share the same directorship and shareholdership (as demonstrated by the company searchrecords), they should be regarded as the same personality for this purpose. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I cannot accept this submission in light of the well established doctrine of separate legal personality and the established exceptionsto the rule against piercing the corporate veil.  It is not even Mr Koâs <i>present</i> submissions that this case falls within any of these established exceptions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Ko also submits that as Asher Model was the management consultant of Hei Hei, it had control over the number of customers whocould enter and stay within the club.  As such, it can be said that Junartâs illegality is so closely connected with Asher Modelthat the doctrine of <i>ex turpi causa</i> still applies. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Whether Asher Model is so closely connected to the âillegalityâ is in my view a question of facts.  However, the managementcontract is not before the court, and the pleaded services rendered by Asher Model to Hei Hei as set out in the Statement of Claimdo <i>not</i> include the day to day running and operation of club or the control of the number of customers entering the club.  As such, I havedifficulty to accept Mr Koâs submissions that, <i>at the present stage</i>, it is clear that the breaching of the special condition is one of Asher Modelâs own creation or is so closely connected to it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  For these reasons, I do not accept it is established <i>now</i> that summarily, the defence of <i>ex turpi causa</i> must apply.  I would not strike out the claim on this basis also.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  I am not satisfied that the claim should be struck out at this stage on the grounds submitted.   I therefore order that Mr Carrollâsapplication be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I further grant an order <i>nisi</i> that costs of the application be to Asher Model, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.
