The 1st defendant is a French National whose last known address was in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.  He isthe sole director of the 2nd defendant which is a Hong Kong registered company incorporated on 5 October 2006 with a registered addressat Level 39, 1 Exchange Square, 8 Connaught Place, Central, Hong Kong.  Both the 1st and 2nd defendants were represented by a firmof solicitors, Messrs Oldham Li &amp; Nie.  They had separately acknowledged service of the writ.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant filed a defence in this action in July and August in October and November in the 1st defendantâs case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Subsequently, upon the courtâs directions, there were exchanges of witness statements and lists of documents and the case wasset down to be tried in the fixture list in April 2008.  Trial bundles were agreed between the partiesâ solicitors in May 2008. On 18 July 2008, the defendantsâ solicitors, Messrs Oldham Li &amp; Nie, successfully obtained an order from the court to ceaseacting for both the 1st and 2nd defendants.  At the date for trial commencing yesterday, neither of the defendants were present. Miss Mak, solicitor for the plaintiff, informed me that the trial bundle had been sent to the defendantsâ solicitors before theyceased acting for the two defendants.  Both defendants should have therefore been notified by the solicitors of the date of trialwhen the date was fixed in April 2008.  Miss Mak has further informed me that their absence today and yesterday must be out of choicerather than ignorance of the date of trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  I accept that there is sufficient evidence in the trial procedure records to show the two defendants had notice of the date of hearingand the pre-trial directions had been complied with.  The defendantsâ absence, I accept, were out of choice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Case</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The plaintiffâs claims against the two defendants are made under five causes of action:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) fraudulent misrepresentation of the 1st defendant;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a> for negligent misrepresentation;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) against the 2nd defendant for total failure of consideration;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) against the 2nd defendant for repudiation of the sponsorship contract;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5) against both defendants for conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is the evidence of Miss Beiler, the marketing manager of the plaintiff, that the plaintiff was approached by Mr Muller, the 1stdefendant, by email on 27 September 2006.  A meeting was arranged on 3 October 2006 when Miss Beiler and her boss, the managing directorof the plaintiff, Mr Buser, met with the 1st defendant, Mr Muller.  Mr Muller invited the plaintiff to take part in the ShanghaiFashion and Jewellery Week (âthe proposed eventâ) to be organised by Mr Muller.  At that meeting, Mr Muller presented variousproposals on the proposed event.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the next day, Miss Beiler received by email a brochure from Mr Muller on the proposed event which would take place at the Shangri-LaPudong Hotel in Shanghai, PRC, between 30 May and 2 June 2007.  Mr Muller had included in the brochure a Financial Times featurearticle with an interview of himself on the âMasters of Excellence Exhibitionâ in Abu Dhabi on 20 May 2006.  According to MissBeiler, she understood from Mr Buser that Chopard had taken part at that particular event in Abu Dhabi.  Mr Muller also enclosedin his email a letter of congratulations from the Abu Dhabi Motors to Mr Muller on the âMasters of Excellence Exhibitionâ.  Thereafter,the plaintiff and Mr Muller communicated further by emails.  Upon the plaintiffâs general manager, Mr Buser, obtaining approvalfrom the plaintiffâs headquarters in Geneva, Miss Beiler was instructed to go ahead with the sponsorship of the proposed eventin Shanghai between May and June 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 13 October 2006, Miss Beiler communicated by telephone with Mr Muller informing him of the plaintiffâs interest in participatingin the proposed event, asking for further details on the event.  On 14 October 2006, the plaintiff received by email a copy of asponsorship contract.  Before signing the sponsorship contract, Miss Beiler proceeded to clarify further detail arrangements of theplaintiffâs participation at the proposed event.  Upon the details being clarified, the plaintiffâs general manager eventuallysigned the sponsorship contract on 25 October 2006.  This was emailed back to Mr Muller.  On the next day, on 26 October 2006, theplaintiff received an invoice for the sum of $300,000 representing 50 per cent of the sponsorship sum in the email from Mr Muller. After further communications between Miss Beiler and Mr Muller on the details of the plaintiffâs sponsorship, the plaintiff paidthe sum demanded by bank deposit of $300,000 into the 2nd defendantâs HSBC account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  According to Miss Beilerâs evidence in court, Mr Muller had invited the plaintiff to take part also in a proposed Beijing showin September 2007 at the very beginning when they first met in October 2006.  Mr Muller had repeated such an invitation again inDecember 2006 but this was turned down by the plaintiff.  They further communicated over the arrangements of the proposed event inFebruary and March 2007, and Mr Muller had confirmed in the email correspondence the plaintiffâs sponsorship of the proposed eventto take place between 30 May to 2 June 2007.  On 22 March 2007, the plaintiff received the last email communication from Mr Mullerwho informed Miss Beiler he would be in Hong Kong in about 10 daysâ time and would communicate with her further upon his returnto Hong Kong.  However, Miss Beiler was not able to get in touch with Mr Muller.  In April 2007 she attempted to contact Mr Mullerby email and telephone but failed to get in touch with him.  She further visited the 2nd defendantâs office address at Level 39,1 Exchange Square but found the address was a commercial office centre.  Inquiries made to the Shangri-La Pudong Hotel in Shanghaiconfirmed that there was no reservation for the proposed event for 30 May to 2 June 2007.  Consequently, the plaintiff caused a solicitorâsletter to be sent to the 2nd defendantâs registered address at Level 39, 1 Exchange Square.  The letter was returned marked âNosuch companyâ.  The plaintiff commenced proceedings against the two defendants in June 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Defence of the 1st defendant claimed he had informed the plaintiff by email and telephone announcing the postponement of theproposed event due to shortage of haute couture garments and had offered an alternative option to the plaintiff to take part in asimilar event in Beijing or Macau in 2008.  The Plaintiff denied the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs claim.  Miss Beiler claimed that she did not receive any such communications from Mr Muller either in his own capacityor as the defendantâs director after 22 March 2007 and there were no announcement of postponement or proposal for an alternativeevent in Beijing or Macau in 2008 whatsoever.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Defendantsâ Defence</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  As the defendants were absent at the trial, no evidence was adduced at the hearing.  The issue at trial is therefore whether theplaintiff has successfully proved its claim against the two defendants.  The defendants admitted in their respective defences thatthere was a sponsorship contract between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant and that the 2nd defendant did receive the HK$300,000from the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issues</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  (1)  The plaintiffâs claim in contract</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Has the sponsorship contract between the plaintiff and the defendant been revoked and is there a total failure of consideration? </p>        <p>(2)  The plaintiffâs claim in tort</p>        <p>Did the 1st defendant misrepresent to the plaintiff and did the 1st defendant conspire with the 2nd defendant in the misrepresentation?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)   Is the plaintiff entitled to recover the deposit of the sponsorship of $300,000 from the 1st and 2nd defendants?</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Analysis</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  <u>The plaintiffâs claim in contract</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Has the sponsorship contract been revoked and is there a total failure of consideration?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">I find the plaintiffâs sponsorship contract was based on a partly oral and partly written agreement.  The oral agreement was reachedbetween Miss Beiler and Mr Muller.  According to Miss Beiler, the contract was signed only by Mr Buser for the plaintiff.  The documentitself showed only one signature signed on behalf of the plaintiff.  Neither the 2nd defendant nor the 1st  defendant had ever signedthis document.  In spite of that, there was clearly an agreement reached between the two parties; this is not disputed by the defendants. Consequently, there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendants for the proposed event.  Since the proposed event nevertook place on 30 May to 2 June 2007, there was a clear breach of the contract.  Even if Mr Mullerâs defence of postponement ofthe proposed event or the alternative proposal of a later event in Beijing or Macau was a genuine one, there is no evidence thatthe plaintiff had accepted either of the two proposals.  There was further no evidence that the sponsorship contract had been amendedby agreement of the parties.  There is therefore a total failure of consideration for the deposit of sponsorship money paid by theplaintiff into the 2nd defendantâs bank account.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  <u>The plaintiffâs claim in tort</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Did the 1st defendant fraudulently misrepresent to the plaintiff and did the 1st defendant conspire with the 2nd defendant in themisrepresentation?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Paragraph 18-1 of <i>Clerk and Linsell on Torts,</i> 19th edition, chapter 18, the learned author said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf the tort involves a perfectly general principle, where a defendant makes a false representation knowing it to be untrue or beingreckless as to whether it is true and intends that the claimant should act in reliance on it, then, insofar as the latter does soand suffers loss, the defendant is liable for that loss.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It is the plaintiffâs case that Mr Muller fraudulently misrepresented to the plaintiff that the proposed event would take placeand also that many other name brands sponsors had committed to the sponsorship of the proposed event.  Contrary to the representationby Mr Muller, the event never took place and no couture houses had been committed to the event.  There was obviously a misrepresentation. Secondly, the plaintiff claimed that Mr Muller cannot hide behind the 2nd defendant and claimed he was merely speaking as a directorof the 2nd defendant or as an agent of the 2nd defendant, and denied liability to the plaintiffâs loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Miss Mak referred me to the House of Lords case of <i>Standard Chartered Bank v. Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 959.</a>  The House of Lords rejected an argument that an agent who lied on his principalâs orders could not be personally liable to therepresentee for loss suffered.  It is clear from the House of Lords case, in Lord Hoffmanâs judgment, that defence is no longeropen to an agent who knew what he represented was not true and the agent should be liable to the plaintiff who suffered because hehad relied on the representation.  I accept the 1st defendant cannot hide behind the 2nd defendant and claim he was merely the 2nddefendantâs director and agent.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  When Mr Muller began negotiating with the plaintiff the proposal of the proposed event in October, the 2nd defendant was not yetincorporated into a company and did not exist.  Mr Muller, therefore, must be the principal and the perpetrator of the fraud.  Further,as he is the sole director of the 2nd defendant and as the companyâs registered address is at an office centre where the 2nd defendanthad only rented a desk, an inference can be drawn that the 2nd defendant is merely a front for Mr Mullerâs business activities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The standard of proof in deceit claims need only be proved to civil standard according to the English Court of Appeal case in <i>Hornal v Neuberger Products</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20QB%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 QB 247.</a>  I am satisfied the plaintiff has successfully shown, on a balance of probability, that Mr Muller had deceived the plaintiff intoentering the sponsorship contract and making an initial payment of 50 per cent of the sponsorship money of $300,000 to Mr Mullervia a bank account opened in the 2nd defendantâs name.  Paragraph 18-2 of <i>Clerk and Linsell on Torts</i> states the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âDeceit and other liability for misrepresentation.  Damages may, of course, be awarded for misrepresentation even if it is not fraudulent. If a representation is a term of a contract, damages are available if it is false without even proof of fault.  Again, since thedecision of the House of Lords in <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Limited v Heller &amp; Partners Limited</i>, it has been clear that misrepresentation can give rise to liability in the tort of negligence at common law, at least where thereis something that can be construed as an acceptance of responsibility for its truth.  In addition, under the Misrepresentation Act1967, section 2(1), a person who induces another to contract with him by misrepresentation is liable unless he proves he was notat fault.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Section 2(1) of the UK Misrepresentation Act of 1967 is almost identical to section 3 of the Hong Kong <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a> in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284">Cap.284</a>.  As Mr Muller did not appear at the trial, his defence was not supported by any evidence and there is no evidence tosupport Mr Mullerâs claim that he was not at fault.  I am therefore satisfied the defendants are liable to compensate the plaintifffor its loss.</p>    <p>(3)     Is the plaintiff entitled to recover the deposit of sponsorship money of $300,000 from the 1st and 2nd defendants?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  For reasons set out above, I am satisfied the 1st and 2nd defendants are liable to return the sum of $300,000 paid by the plaintiffto the 2nd defendant on the basis that the proposed event never took place, the venue was never booked, and there was no evidenceof any fashion houses having been committed to take part other than the plaintiff.  It is a breach of sponsorship contract by bothdefendants and on the basis of the common law principle of money had and received, the 1st defendant, though not paid the money directly,did derive a benefit from it.  An explanation of this principle can be found in <i>Goff and Jones, Law of Restitution</i>, 7th edition, paragraph 1-002, and the 1st defendant being one and the same entity as the 2nd defendant therefore should be liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As to the plaintiffâs fifth cause of action of conspiracy to defraud, it is technically a criminal offence.  In any event, undertort, though it is also a possible cause of action, on analysis, a conspiracy must be an act performed by two or more persons.  AsI have found the 2nd defendant is, in fact, merely a vehicle employed by the 1st defendant to perpetrate the deception, the 1st defendantbeing the sole director and shareholder, it simply means the 1st defendant was conspiring with his alto ego.  I am not convincedthat it is a proper cause of action in this particular case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  For the aforesaid reasons, I find the case proved against the 1st and 2nd defendants.  I give judgment against the two defendantsfor the sum claimed of $300,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Interest</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Miss Mak cited and relied on the case of <i>Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated v Maclaine Watson &amp; Co. Limited (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%203%20All%20ER%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 3 All ER 723</a> on the matters relating to pre-judgment interest that the commercial interest of 1 per cent over the base rate should be awardedas pre-judgment interest.  I am satisfied that that is the rate usually awarded in the commercial court and I refer to Order 6/L/11to 16 in the Practice Notes of the Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2008 which also confirms the same principle of commercial interest. In this particular case which involved deception by the defendant and as the plaintiff is a commercial entity, I would apply thepractice of the commercial court and award interest from the date of writ to the date of judgment on the judgment sum at 1 per centover the base rate or best lending rate and thereafter at judgment rate until full payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Costs</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Miss Mak has asked for costs to the plaintiff be awarded on an indemnity basis.  She relied on the case authority that costs maybe so awarded in cases where the circumstance or conduct takes the case out of the norm.  The case referred to is <i>Excelsior Commercial and Industrial Holdings Limited v Salisbury Hamer Aspden &amp; Johnson (a firm)</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/879.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] EWCA Civ 879.</a>  The award of costs is a discretion of the court.  It is true that Mr Muller seems to have hidden behind the 2nd defendant and hadonly appeared some three to four months after the writ was issued by the plaintiff.  Although the 2nd defendant did acknowledge receiptof the writ and file defence in July and August, Mr Muller eventually, through a firm of solicitors, acknowledged receipt of thewrit (served on him out of jurisdiction) in October and November and thereafter all the pre-trial procedures were followed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Both defendants failed to appear at the trial which, I am told by Miss Mak, did not appear as a surprise to her after the firm ofsolicitors had applied to court to discharge themselves.  But, by not appearing to defend the case, the defendants inadvertentlyhave saved some of the courtâs time.  On the conduct of the defendants, I do not consider that the circumstances or the conducthad, in a technical sense, taken the case out of the norm, for that reason I order costs to the Plaintiff on a party and party basisto be taxed if not agreed.  I do not think the defendantsâ conduct or behaviour warranted a higher level of taxation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Discussion)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I further dismiss the 2nd defendantâs counterclaim.</p>     <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(H C Wong)<br />            District Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Miss Christine Mak of Messrs J Chan, Yip, So &amp; Partners, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>1st Defendant, in person, absent</p>        <p>2nd Defendant, in person, absent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2008/258.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
