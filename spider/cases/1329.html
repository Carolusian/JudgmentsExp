Pâs products were well known to the public and in particular amongstAfrican Countries by reference to Trade Marks.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  P used Registered Mark on various ladiesâ fashions since its creation. Ladiesâ fashions bearing Registered Mark were/are displayedand sold at Pâs shop at Cheung Sha Wan Road.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  P instructed, authorised and granted licences to some PRC manufacturers (â<u>Manufacturers</u>â) for production of ladiesâ fashions bearing Registered Mark. P disclosed 2 Chinese written agreements dated 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2002 between P and 2 Manufacturers whereby Manufacturers acknowledged they would not sell production goods or give confidentialinformation/Registered Mark to third parties or (save as permitted) reproduce Registered Mark. P also produced a declaration dated3<sup>rd</sup> August 2003 signed by P and such Manufacturers to the effect that except for any express authorisation, P had not authorised anythird party to produce, manufacture or sell Registered Mark or labels. Registered Marks or labels should be sent directly to Manufacturersand they should deliver production goods on completion to P and not to any third parties (such as HWH). P gave no explanation whyHWH was mentioned in the declaration.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  D had never been authorised, instructed and/or licensed by P to produce, display, offer for sale, sell and/or supply different typesof ladiesâ fashions bearing one or more of Trade Marks (including Registered Mark).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On/about 24<sup>th</sup> September 2002, officers of the Customs and Excise Department (â<u>CED</u>â) attended Dsâ shop at Cheung Sha Wan Road (â<u>Dsâ Shop</u>â) and seized 23 sets of ladiesâ suits bearing purported Registered Mark (â<u>Ladiesâ Suits</u>â). P subsequently confirmed Ladiesâ Suits to be infringing products bearing forged Registered Mark (â<u>Purported Mark</u>â). D2 was charged with the offence of âpossession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture goods to which a forgedtrade mark was appliedâ (â<u>Offence</u>â) under section 9 of the Trade Description Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/362">Cap.362</a> (â<u>TDO</u>â). D2 was convicted on his own plea at North Kowloon Magistracy (â<u>Conviction</u>â) and the infringing Ladiesâ Suits were confiscated.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  P pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim (as verified by her affirmation) that despite Conviction, Ds continued and are stillcontinuing the display, offer for sale, sale and/or supply of ladiesâ fashions bearing Trade Marks and Registered Mark. However,she did not depose to any specific incident in relation to such complaint.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  P claimed that unless retrained by the court, Ds intended to and would continue to infringe and to cause/enable/assist others toinfringe Registered Mark. By reason of Dsâ said infringement, P suffered loss and damage. P did not depose to any particulars inrespect of the loss and damages suffered.</p>    <p class="heading">Dâs case on Pâs Summons</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  D2 in his affirmation stated that sometime in early September 2002, he was approached by an African male (â<u>Male</u>â) at Dsâ Shop. Male claimed to be a fashions supplier. He told D2 his name was âWejoor Westâ but did not give D2 any companyor name card. Male said he would leave D2 some samples of ladiesâ suits for inspection and arranged for further discussion later.Male then left 23 sets of various styles of ladiesâ suits (ie Ladiesâ Suits) and told D2 he would come to see D2 later. Ds didnot pay any money to Male.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Ladiesâ Suits bore Purported Mark but D2 did not know and had no reason to believe that it was a registered trade mark. LadiesâSuits were placed at Dsâ Shop but they were not displayed for sale. Dsâ firm had no intention to sell Ladiesâ Suits at allmaterial times.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  D2 pleaded guilty to Offence and was convicted. He pleaded guilty because he mistakenly believed it was sufficient for Dsâ firmto be in actual possession of Ladiesâ Suits with Purported Mark. But D2 denied Dsâ firm had any intention to sell or manufactureLadiesâ Suits and further denied P suffered any loss or damages due to the alleged infringement of Registered Mark. The wholesaleprice of each set of Ladiesâ Suit would only have been HK$60.00.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  After Conviction, Dsâ firm had never infringed Registered Mark or at all. Dsâ firm was surprised to receive the writ of summonsin the present proceedings. P failed to adduce any evidence that Dsâ firm continued with any infringement of Registered Mark asalleged or at all. Consequently, even if Dsâ firm had infringed Registered Mark, P would only be entitled to claim damages of nomore than HK$1,500.00, which was outside the jurisdiction of the District Court. Ds should be granted unconditional leave to defendPâs claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Pâs Summons : undisputed matters</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The new <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap.559</a> came into effect on 4<sup>th</sup> April 2003 and replaced the old <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/43">Cap.43</a> (â<u>TMO</u>â).

The test in an Order 14 application is whether the defence is credible. If yes, the defendant mustbe given leave to defend; if not, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment (<b>Ng Shou Chun v Hung Chun San</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20HKC%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 HKC 155).</a></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Ms Ng referred me to <b>Tandy/Rank Video &amp; anor v Yee Hing Cassette Factory Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKC%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKC 136</a> on the test for summary judgment in relation to an infringement of trade mark. However, in <b>Hugo Boss AG and anor v Y &amp; Fung Garment Company Limited trading as Westwood</b> HCA608/2000, Deputy High Court Judge Muttrie (unreported, 21<sup>st</sup> June 2001), the learned judge pointed out that the court in <b>Tandy/Rank Video</b>âs case (supra) relied largely on the earlier decision of <b>Murjani v Bank of India</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 586.</a> The learned judge chose to follow the principles in <b>Ng Shou Chun</b>âs case (supra) referred to above. I adopt his approach.</p>    <p class="heading">Pâs Summons : analysis</p>    <p class="heading">(a) D2âs explanation of possession of Ladiesâ Suits</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Ms Hui submitted that P failed to satisfy the requirement that D âuses [Purported Mark] in the course of tradeâ. Neither MsHui nor Ms Ng cited any legal authority on the interpretation of this requirement, but urged me to consider the plain and obviousmeaning of the words used.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Relying on D2âs explanation of how Ds came to be in possession of Ladiesâ Suits as described in paragraph 18 above (â<u>Possession Explanation</u>â), Ms Hui submitted that Ladiesâ Suits were never put on sale. But is Possession Explanation credible or believable?</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I agree with Ms Ng that Possession Explanation is nothing more than a bare assertion unsupported by any other evidence or documents.I note that although Ds presented a positive argument by Possession Explanation that Ladiesâ Suits had never been put on sale,the material facts in relation to Possession Explanation have not been pleaded in Dsâ Defence.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Briefly, Possession Explanation is that Male came to Dsâ Shop presumably to solicit business/orders for Ladiesâ Suits and left23 Ladiesâ Suits with D2 for his consideration. I bear in mind that Male was said to be a fashions supplier. But apart from thename of âWejoor Westâ, D2 has not disclosed any information at all about Male.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Given that Male was said to be a fashions supplier and was presumably soliciting business/orders at Dâs Shop, I find it strangethat he did not leave any name card, company card, contact details or even his directions. D2 did not descend to explain what hemeant by â<i>arranged</i> for further discussion laterâ (my emphasis) and whether any such further discussion with Male took place at all.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There is a complete paucity of evidence as to why Male chose to approach Dsâ Shop and as to any preliminary discussions betweenMale and D2. It is improbable that Male left 23 Ladiesâ Suits (some were two-piece suits and some were three-piece suits) withD2 without any preliminary marketing exchange on the garments, eg garment materials, manufacturing origin, proposed price, etc. Moreimportantly, there is no evidence that Male returned to Dsâ Shop in the several weeks up to seizure of Ladiesâ Suits by CED (iefrom early September up to 24<sup>th</sup> September 2002) to see D2 for âdiscussionâ as he said he would. There is also no evidence that Male enquired or came to DsâShop any time thereafter for âdiscussionâ and no explanation why he did not do so. There is no or no sensible commercial reasonwhy Male would abandon 23 Ladiesâ Suits or leave them with D2 indefinitely when, according to Dsâ case, he said he would returnto discuss business. Interestingly, D2 did not express any surprise or concern in this respect.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Further, Dâs case is made more difficult to believe because the quantity of âsamplesâ Male left with D2, ie 23 Ladiesâ Suits,is not small. There is no credible explanation as to why close to 2 dozen samples were left with D. Although D2 claimed they wereof various styles, the Record of Preliminary Examination at p.46 of the hearing bundle only separated Ladiesâ Suits into 6 three-piecesuits and 17 two-piece suits. I also note there is no suggestion of any receipt or acknowledgment given by D2 for taking possessionof Ladiesâ Suits. Ds did not produce any internal record of having taken possession of 23 Ladiesâ Suits as samples as distinctfrom their own inventory stock.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The overall picture which D2 attempted to present was that Ladiesâ Suits had been kept at Dsâ Shop for several weeks with nothingdone about them. I find Possession Explanation wholly incredible. It is useful to refer to <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> (supra at para.14/4/3 at p.160) as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âA desire to investigate alleged obscurities and a hope that something will turn up on the investigation cannot, separately or together,amount to sufficient reason for rfusing to enter judgment for the plaintiff. You do not get leave to defend by putting forward acase that is all surmise and Micawberismâ (<i>per</i> Megarry V.-C. in <i>Lady Anne Tennant v. Associated Newspapers Group Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20FSR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] F.S.R. 298).â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(b) Conviction</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Ms Hui suggested that Conviction did not assist Pâs case. She submitted that since the criminal law protected the trade mark ownerbefore he suffered any damage, Conviction could not aid P in establishing any act of infringement. By this I presume Ms Hui meantthat CEDâs seizure of Ladiesâ Suits prevented any possible sale, so there could not have been any âuse in the course of tradeâthat constituted an infringement. This can be surmised from Ms Huiâs further argument that Offence was for possession of âthegoods with the intention of trading them. The offence does not require there to have been any actual offering for sale or misrepresentationâ.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The charge against D2 was under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)</a> of TDO which provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âSubject to the provisions of this Ordinance, any person who sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or for any purposeof trade or manufacture â¦â¦ commits an offence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I accept the aforesaid provision draws a distinction between (a) actual sale and (b) possession for sale or for the purpose of tradeor manufacture. But, as explained below, the requirement of âuse in the course of tradeâ in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> of TMO does not necessarily require an actual sale.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In my view, Conviction is admissible evidence for the purpose of proving that D2 committed Offence of being in possession of LadiesâSuits for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture. Normally, the usual effect if a conviction is to shift the burden of proofto the person convicted although at the end of the day the trial judge need to evaluate the probative force of the conviction (see<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 62</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a> and <b>Stupple v Royal Insurance Co Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 50)).</a></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As Ms Hui conceded, Conviction is quite a persuasive piece of evidence in support of Pâs contentions. Although I agree that Convictionalone will not establish all the requirements under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> of TMO, if D2 had in his possession Ladiesâ Suits âfor saleâ or âfor any purpose of trade or manufactureâ (as evidencedby Offence for which D2 was convicted), it certainly goes a long way in establishing the requirement that Ds used Purported Markin the course of trade.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Are Ds able to raise an arguable or triable explanation for Conviction? Again, D2âs explanation in respect of Conviction outlinedin paragraph 20 above (â<u>Conviction Explanation</u>â) is nothing more than a bare assertion. D2 did not say what steps he took to appreciate and understand Offence with which he wascharged. At the very least since 25<sup>th</sup> February 2004 (when the acknowledgment of service was filed in the present proceedings) Ds have had the benefit of legal advice.Ms Ng complained that D2 had taken no step in trying to reverse plea/appeal. I note that even on an alternative basis there is noevidence before me that D2 or Ds informed P or Pâs solicitors about Conviction Explanation prior to D2âs affirmation filed inopposition of Pâs Summons. The material facts of Conviction Explanation have also not been pleaded in Dsâ Defence.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I am not persuaded that Conviction Explanation proffered is believable or credible, particularly as I have found D2âs evidenceon Possession Explanation improbable. Indeed, Ms Hui puts her case no higher than Conviction âdoes not <i>exclude the possibility</i> of there being an issue which can only be resolved by hearing from the witnesses and forming a view as to their credibility; in otherwords a triable issueâ (my emphasis). But the court is not concerned with excluding possibilities. Rather, it is incumbent on Dsto raise an arguable defence or triable issue from Conviction Explanation that justifies having the issue resolved at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Ms Ng tried to argue that if D2 had been mistaken about Conviction as claimed, he could easily have applied to reverse his pleabecause <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(3A)(b)</a> of TDO permits a defence on the ground that the trade mark or mark was not used by him in the course of any trade or business asa trade mark in relation to goods. However, such provision relates to the deeming provision in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(3)</a> which in turn refers to the offences in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(1)(a)</a> and (b). Thus, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(3A)(b)</a> of TDO is irrelevant to the offence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)</a> on which Conviction was based.</p>    <p class="heading">(c) âUse in the course of tradeâ</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Several undisputed matters are of note : (a) Ds carried on business as trader and wholesaler of clothes at Dsâ Shop, (b) LadiesâSuits were of the same category of merchandise (ie clothes) sold at Dsâ Shop, and (c) Ladiesâ Suits were seized by CED duringthe day at 11:50 am. Having rejected Possession and Conviction Explanations, is there sufficient evidence of the requirement of âusein the course of tradeâ?</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In my view, there is sufficient evidence of âuseâ since Purported Mark was actually used on Ladiesâ Suits (see also <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(2)(b)</a> of TMO). I reject Ms Huiâs contention that âuse in the course of tradeâ is restricted to actual sale. Activities in the courseof trade can be wide-ranging (see the judgment of Rogers J (as he then was) in <b>Stichting Greenpeace Council v Income Team Limited trading as Green Peace and ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKLR%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKLR 269).</a> It can include communications, for example by way of orders and invoices, with suppliers and trade customers (<b>Kerlyâs</b> <b>Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</b> 13<sup>th</sup> ed (2001) para.13-11 at p.350). In <b>Hermes Trade Mark</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20RPC%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] RPC 425</a>, Falconer J held that âin the course of tradeâ must be wide enough to embrace the steps necessary for the production of the goodsas well as actually placing them on the market. It is not confined to use involving a sale of the goods in question and includesuse of the trade mark in the course of acquiring the goods for future sale (<b>Emerson Radio Corporation v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue</b> Inland Revenue Appeal No.2/1997, Mr Recorder Ribeiro SC (as he then was) (unreported, 30<sup>th</sup> June 1998) at para.55).</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  âUse in the course of tradeâ may therefore take a variety of forms during the manufacture, marketing and actual sale of thegoods. Hence, when Possession and Conviction Explanations have been rejected and with the support of Conviction, Dsâ possessionof Ladiesâ Suits for sale or for the purpose of trade or manufacture in Dsâ Shop (where Ds traded as trader/wholesaler of clothing)is in my view sufficient to satisfy the requirement of âuse in the course of tradeâ.</p>    <p class="heading">(d) Loss and damage</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Ms Hui submitted that P had not been able to demonstrate any loss or damages in that (a) since Ladiesâ Suits had never been puton sale, it was unlikely that Pâs reputation suffered any loss, and (b) the wholesale cost of Ladiesâ Suits could not have exceededHK$1,500.00 which was outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Ms Hui fairly accepted that if I find (which I did above) Possession Explanation incredible or unbelievable, (a) in the above paragraphcannot be supported. I am, however, prepared to deal with Ms Huiâs argument that, irrespective of whether Ladiesâ Suits had beenput on sale or not, P failed to establish any loss of reputation and that without establishing the essential requirement of damages,P failed to establish any infringement of Registered Mark.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  On the other hand, Ms Ng argued that Pâs damages included loss of reputation/ goodwill, loss arising from diversion of customersand loss of profits. She further submitted that since Inquiry or Account would normally be dealt with after the summary judgmentapplication or trial on liability (<b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> (supra) para.100/3/1 at p.1164), the relevant evidence would be adduced at that second stage.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  By my directions dated 14<sup>th</sup> March 2005 after the hearing, I referred counsel to the following passage from <b>Kerlyâs</b> (supra) paras.18-140 at p.694 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt was long ago decided at common law that the mere proof of an infringement entitles the claimant to damages. Consequently, noallegation of special damage is a necessary part of his case. The natural consequence of an infringement, even though it be madein complete ignorance of the claimantâs rights, is that the infringer must pay at least nominal damages, and the costs of action:â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The above succinct summary provides the answer to Ms Huiâs contention that the cause of action on infringement of trade mark isincomplete without evidence of substantial loss/damages.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  However, that still leaves open the question as to whether P has shown that she may be able to recover substantial damages as opposednominal damages. This is a matter that I will deal with below.</p>    <p class="heading">(e) Inquiry or Account</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I therefore find P is successful in seeking judgment on liability for infringement of Registered Mark under Pâs Summons. The issueis what reliefs P is entitled. P did not lead any affidavit evidence on substantial loss and damages. Ms Ngâs argument is thatsuch evidence should be left to the second stage of Inquiry or Account.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I have referred the parties to <b>Kerlyâs</b> (supra) para.18-141 at pp.694-695 which reads as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn order to obtain an order for an account of profits or an inquiry as to damages, the claimant need in general only show thathe may be able to recover substantial damages. This is not a high hurdle at all, and in general the attitude of the court is thatthe defendant can be protected against the costs of an inquiry or account which results in no, or only a very small award, by makinga payment into court and thus letting the claimant bear the risk of the costs of the proceeding. Hence an inquiry should be orderedeven if the court feels serious doubt about the claimantâs ability to recover any substantial amount. â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>However, where the claimant fails to clear this low threshold, the court may award nominal damages or fix a sum without ordering anaccount or an inquiry as to damages.

In the former case he said as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn these circumstances, my conclusions are as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>1. I am prepared to grant a declaration and an injunction pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21(2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2. I am not prepared to direct an inquiry as to damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21(2)</a>, but I will do so if the plaintiff can put in evidence to show a prima facie case for establishing that it has suffered some damageas a result of the receipt of the principal letter; however, I will only accord the plaintiff that opportunity if it is preparedto accept that, if after it has had the opportunity to file such further evidence, the court does not think it right to order aninquiry as to damages, the plaintiff will then abandon its claim for damages; â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Neuberger J in <b>Beautimatic</b> <b>International Limited</b>âs case (supra) stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âWhere a court accepts that the claimant has established a breach of an intellectual property right and does not go on to assessdamages, it is often thought that the claimant is entitled, virtually as of right, to an inquiry as to damages. In many cases, thatis true: either it will have been clear to the court during the hearing that it is very likely that the claimant has suffered damage,or commercial commonsense suggests, in light of the particular facts, that the claimant is very likely to have suffered damage. However,particularly in light of the Civil Procedure Rules, it does not seem to me that such a course is justified in a case such as this,where there is no evidence of Beautimatic having suffered damage, and it is by no means obvious on the facts as established thatBeautimatic will have suffered damage. I do not think that on the present state of the evidence, it would be right for me to orderan inquiry for damages, with all the potential court time and costs which it would involve. On the other hand, it seems to me thatit would be wrong to let the claim for an inquiry as to damages go to trial or to dismiss it without giving Beautimatic the opportunityof persuading me that it has at least a real prospect of recovering some damages. The course I propose to take is to give Beautimaticthe opportunity to put before the Court some evidence and/or argument to show that it has a real prospect of recovering damages,with a view either to ordering an inquiry if I am satisfied that there is such a real prospect, or to dismissing the claim for damages(or giving judgment for nominal damages) if I am not so satisfied.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Ms Ng in her further written submissions suggested that <b>Prince plc</b>âs case (supra) and <b>Beautimatic International Limited</b>âs case (supra) are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. It was submitted that <b>Prince plc</b>âs case was one on threats of proceedings for infringement where the damages suffered were often remote and difficult to substantiateas compared with an infringement action. Ms Ng argued that in <b>Beautimatic International Limited</b>âs case (supra), the plaintiffâs mark was used by the defendant on the packaging of infringing products which were not to be marketedor sold within the jurisdiction and on various invoices, so it would be difficult for the plaintiff to argue it suffered or wouldhave suffered damages.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In my view, the principles Neuberger J referred to above do not turn on the factual circumstances of the liability issue which MsNg alluded to above. The principles are concerned with whether an inquiry for damages ought to have been ordered at the summary judgmentstage and the key consideration is whether, irrespective of the question of liability or of the nature/circumstances of the infringementthat has been proved, the plaintiff has led any evidence on loss and damages that justifies the making of an order for inquiry.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  For this application, Ms Ng fairly conceded that there was no evidence showing actual loss and damages suffered as a result of Dsâinfringement. However, she invited the court to draw inferences from the surrounding circumstances. Ms Ng argued that because (a)Ladiesâ Suits were found inside Dsâ Shop, (b) Ladiesâ Suits were capable of being of being marketed and sold in Hong Kong,and (c) Dsâ Shop and Pâs shop were in close proximity in the same area, commercial commonsense suggested that â[P] would atleast be suffering from loss of profit on such sales by [Ds] she would have made otherwiseâ.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The short answer to these grounds is that on the present evidence Ladiesâ Suits have been confiscated and therefore not capableof being marketed or sold. There is, as Ms Ng frankly admitted, no evidence before me of other potentially infringing products. Inrespect of the matter of damages, there is also no evidence before me that Pâs sales have been diminished during the relevant periodand no evidence of injury to Pâs trade reputation (let alone whether any such diminishment or injury was caused by Dsâ infringement).In respect of the matter of loss of profits, an account of profits is confined to profits actually made, its purpose being to deprivethe defendant of unjust enrichment rather than to punish him (<b>Kerlyâs</b> (supra) para.18-156 at pp.698-699). But, as explained above, other than the confiscated and unsold Ladiesâ Suits, there is at presentno evidence of other infringing products. I also cannot see how the geographical location of Pâs shop and Dsâ Shop necessarilygives rise to an inference of damages or loss of profit.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In the circumstances, since P has not led any evidence of loss and damage arising from Dsâ infringement other than her mere assertion,I am initially minded, following Neuberger Jâs approach, to give P a further opportunity to submit evidence in support of an orderfor Inquiry or Account. However, Ms Ng tried to further distinguish <b>Prince plc</b>âs case (supra) and <b>Beautimatic International Limited</b>âs case (supra) by suggesting that in the present case P sought Inquiry or Account as distinct from a mere inquiry of damages only.She submitted that P could not be put to election at this stage because discovery from Ds would be necessary to enable P to makean informed decision as to whether to seek Inquiry or Account (see <b>Kerlyâs</b> (supra) paras. 18-157 â 18-158 at pp.699-700). Hence, Ms Ng said it would be premature for P at this stage to provide evidenceshowing that she might be able to recover substantial damages or loss of profits.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Given that P is not prepared to avail itself of the opportunity that I am minded to give, I conclude that I am not satisfied thatP is entitled to an order for Inquiry or Account at the Order 14 stage. The application for this relief has to proceed to trial.</p>    <p class="heading">(f)<i> Injunction</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Ms Hui argued that since Ladiesâ Suits were confiscated, there would be no risk of any further infringement of Registered Mark.Further, D2 had denied on affirmation any other infringement of Registered Mark. P was unable to prove any further threat of infringementthat justified the granting of Registered Mark Injunction or Delivery Up Order.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Ms Ng referred to the judgment of Deputy High Court Judge Fung in <b>Creative Technology Limited v Videocom Technology Limited and anor</b> HCA1434/2002 (unreported, 21<sup>st</sup> February 2003) at paras. 47 and 48 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â47.

Normally, when a defendant has infringed,the court will assume it is not a one-off activity and will grant an injunction to stop repetition. This course is not inevitable.In a few cases courts have concluded that even though infringement has occurred, no future threat exists. In such cases, injunctiverelief has been refused."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">48. I agree that injunction is a discretionary remedy and it will not be granted unless some threat, possibility or likelihood offuture infringement is shown. I echo Laddie J in <strong>Coflexip</strong> that normally, when a defendant has infringed the plaintiff's goods, the court will assume it is not a one-off activity and willgrant an injunction, unless persuaded otherwise.

Only in relationto a dishonest trader could the court assume the likelihood that (a) he had in the past dealt extensively in infringing goods and(b) unless restrained by a far-reaching injunction he would continue to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In <b>Microsoft Corporation</b>âs case (supra), the defendant had evinced no intention to deal in counterfeit software. But a trader, however, honest, who purchasedthe plaintiffâs software otherwise from an authorised distributor owed the plaintiff a duty to take some steps to satisfy himselfthat the product was genuine â <i>a fortiori</i> once this had occurred, the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction restraining the defendant from dealing in software which he knewor ought upon reasonable enquiry to know was counterfeit.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Here, even with my rejection of Possession Explanation, there is little to suggest knowledge or dishonesty or reckless indifferenceon Dsâ part. The grounds Ms Ng relied on were (a) P registered Registered Mark more than a year before September 2002, (b) P andDs carried on business in the same trade, (c) Pâs shop and Dsâ Shop were both at Cheung Sha Wan Road, (d) Ladiesâ Suits wereleft at Dsâ Shops for a few weeks and (e) there was no evidence that Ds took any step to check whether Ladiesâ Suits infringedany registered trade mark.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I do not see how ground (a) is pertinent to Dsâ mental state, there being no suggestion or no basis was shown that Ds ought inthe usual manner of trade to have checked or made attempts to find out that P was or has became the proprietor of Registered Mark.By her own pleadings, P revealed she herself as a single trader already owned numerous trade marks. There is no evidence of any commonpractice or trade custom/usage or any other basis to suggest that a trader is reasonably expected or required to know all of itscompetitorsâ registered trade marks. Likewise, grounds (b) and (c) do not bring the matter further. Proximity in the nature ofbusiness or geographical location without more does not necessarily breed knowledge of another traderâs registered trade marks.Ground (d) at most shows knowledge of possession of Ladiesâ Suit with Purported Mark, which is different from having awarenessof or being recklessly indifferent that Purported Mark was an infringing mark.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Ms Ng tried to argue by grounds (d) and (e) that Ds were recklessly indifferent. But there is no evidence that it is usual or expectedfor traders and wholesalers in clothes to check/verify the marks of clothing supplies from suppliers or to make enquiries with thesuppliers or registered owners of such marks or to take any other steps to ascertain whether they were infringing marks. It is adifferent situation from <b>Microsoft Corporation</b>âs case (supra) where the plaintiff had a known authorised dealership system for selling its products.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the assumptions in support of Registered Mark Injunction can be drawn from all thecircumstances and P is therefore not entitled to Registered Mark Injunction at the Order 14 stage. The application for this reliefhas to proceed to trial. Given the concession by Ms Ng that Delivery Up and Discovery Orders stand and fall with Registered MarkInjunction, they will also have to proceed to trial.</p>    <p class="heading">Dâs Summons</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In support of Dâs Summons, Ms Hui submitted that although P alleged in her pleadings that Dsâ firm had continued the wrongfulinfringements of Registered Mark and had passed off other goods as Pâs merchandise, D2 in his affirmation denied Dsâ firm hadin any way infringed Registered Mark after Conviction or at all and P was unable to produce any evidence of Dsâ continued infringement.Further, P would have difficulty in establishing any damage to its reputation. Therefore, there are serious âevidential omissionsâin respect of Pâs claims. For these reasons, D sought to strike out Passages.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Dâs Summons is hopeless from the start. The application is made under Order 18 rule 19(1)(a) of the Rules of the District Court.Order 18 rule 19(2) specifically provides that âno evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph 1(a)â. <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> (supra) at para.18/19/3 at p.315 summarises the law as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âO.18, r.19(2) excludes evidence (whether by the applicant or the respondent) on an application under O.18, r.19(1)(a). The courtis obliged to look at the indorsement on the writ or the pleading without extrinsic evidence and decide whether on the assumptionthat the facts as pleaded are true the indorsement or pleading discloses a cause of action or defence in law â¦â¦ Affidavit evidenceis equally inadmissible where the only ground on which the statement of claim can be said to disclose no reasonable cause of actionis that the action is unlikely to succeed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in concluding that I am not entitled to refer to any affidavit evidence in consideringDâs Summons. Without such affidavit evidence and on the assumption that the facts pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim aretrue, I cannot see any basis for saying that Passages are so obviously unsustainable or unarguably bad that ought to be struck out.The mere fact that a case is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In face of such insurmountable difficulty, Ms Hui suggested that the Amended Statement of Claim lacked particulars to support Passages.However, she agreed that a striking out application should only be made in plain and obvious cases and cited <b>Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20WLR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 WLR 688</a> in support of such proposition. I endorse the views of the learned editors of <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> (supra) para.18/19/6 at p.317 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âWhere a pleading is defective only in not containing particulars to which the other side is entitled, application should be madefor particulars under r.12, and not for an order to strike out the pleading under this rule. Even a serious want of particularityin a pleading may not justify striking-out if (1) the defect can be remedied, and (2) the defect is not the result of a blatant disregardof court orders (<i>British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v. Sir Robert McAlpine</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=72%20BLR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">72 B.L.R. 26).â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Passages actually deal with the passing-off claim in respect of Trade Marks and the essential elements of such tort (<b>Reckkitt Coleman v Borden Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20All%20ER%20873" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 All ER 873).</a> Even if further particulars are required, I do not consider it a sufficient basis to say Passages are unsustainable or unarguablybad. I decline to strike out Passages.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In respect of Pâs Summons, I find that P has established its claim on infringement of Registered Mark. However, I am unable togrant P the reliefs it sought. In the circumstances, I make the following orders :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) There be interlocutory judgment on liability in Pâs favour against Ds in respect of Pâs cause of action against Ds for infringementof Registered Mark.</p>        <p>(b) There be unconditional leave defend in respect of paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (6) of the prayers of relief set out in the AmendedStatement of Claim, namely, Registered Mark Injunction, Delivery Up Order, Inquiry or Account and Discovery Order.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In respect of costs, the practical reality is that P has succeeded on liability but failed to obtain the reliefs sought under PâsSummons. But it is significant to note that P has successfully established an invasion of her rights. I refer to <b>Kerly</b>âs(supra) at para.18-140 at p.694 referred to above where the learned authors opined that the natural consequence of an infringementis that the infringer âmust pay at least nominal damages, and <i>the costs of action</i>â (my emphasis). However, since P only sought summary judgment for part of her case and since P failed to obtain the reliefs shesought at the Order 14 stage, I consider the appropriate costs order is as follows : save and except that (a) a third of the costsof the hearing time before me and (b) the costs of Ms Ngâs further written submissions be costs in the cause of the action, Dsdo pay P costs of the Order 14 application (including all costs reserved in respect of Pâs Summons, if any) to be taxed if notagreed with certificate for counsel. I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> to that effect.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Dâs Summons is dismissed. I grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that Ds do pay P costs of Dâs Summons (including all costs reserved in respect of Dâs Summons, if any) to be taxed if not agreedwith certificate for counsel.</p>    <p class="heading">Publication of this decision</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Pursuant to Practice Direction 25.1, I request the parties to make written representations on the release of this decision for publicationwithin the next 7 days.
