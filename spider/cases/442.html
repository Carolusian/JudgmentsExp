plaintiff claims damages for injuries caused to her when she fell from her wheelchair on two separate occasions.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The first accident happened on 3 February 2006 at about 4.30 pm whilst the plaintiff was using a wheelchair lift operated by staffof the defendant.  The plaintiff was pushing herself off the platform of a wheelchair lift that she had used to ascend a set of stairsin order to gain entry to Lung Cheung Shopping Mall.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In respect of this accident the plaintiff fell from her wheelchair as she exited from the lift and the plaintiff says that whateverwas the cause of the accident, and the plaintiff cannot, from her personal knowledge, identify just precisely what was the cause,it cannot have been caused other than by the negligence of the defendant.  To the extent that it may be necessary to do so the plaintiffrelies upon the doctrine of <i>res ipsa </i>loquitur.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff suffered a second fall from her wheelchair on 8 December 2006 and though the circumstances of this fall did not involvethe defendant she claims that contributing factors to the occurrence of the second accident were hip and limb stiffness and an exaggeratedanxiety of falling from her wheelchair, both being conditions from which she was then suffering as a result of the first accident.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On both the occasions that the plaintiff had these accidents she was using the same wheelchair.  This wheelchair had a seat beltand the plaintiff claims that on both occasions she had secured the seat belt.  However notwithstanding this, on both occasions theseat belt separated and failed to restrain her within the wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  After the second accident, the plaintiff changed her wheelchair and her replacement had a different type of safety harness.  Consequentlywhen she testified in court the plaintiff was using a different wheelchair with a different restraint system from the one she wasusing at the time of both accidents.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In her Statement of Claim the plaintiff claims damages in negligence for the defendantâs breach of a duty of care that she claimswas owed by it to her and for breach of the common duty of care under the Occupierâs Liability Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In respect of the first accident, the defendant denies that it owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and that if it did the accidentwas due to its breach of any such duty, and further that if it was the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In respect of the second accident, the defendant says it cannot be causally connected to the first accident and therefore the defendantis not liable for the injuries the plaintiff suffered as a result of it.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Most of us can look back on a happy childhood in which we ran around with our friends, playing games together and participatingin sport.  Occasionally our physical activity might have caused skinned knees, sprained ankles or bruises about our bodies.  Morerarely some of us may have suffered fractures of our bones.  But more often than not these injuries were but mild interruptions toa lifestyle where we took for granted our good health and our robust bodyâs ability to heal itself.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  That was not a childhood that the plaintiff could enjoy for she was born with a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesisimperfecta is more commonly known as brittle bone disease and leaves its victims with weak bones which are very susceptible to fracture. For such persons fractured bones are a regular occurrence and as they grow into adolescence they may find themselves spending moretime in hospitals than in playgrounds.  Their education is affected and they may have to receive tutoring from their hospital bedsor at home.  Thus it was with this plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Persons suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta need very gentle handling for pressure or force applied to them clumsily or inappropriatelymay result in a fracture.  There is no more dramatic illustration of how careful such persons must be treated than that even thedoctor examining her for this litigation refused to assist in her transfer from wheelchair to examination bed for fear of injuringher.  Her condition adds a whole new dimension to our understanding of the word âfragileâ and the phrase âhandle with careâ.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The plaintiff was born on 1 July 1983 and so has just turned 28 years of age.  Within weeks of her birth she was being treated bythe staff at the Duchess of Kent Childrenâs Hospital at Sandy Bay for fractures of her femurs and radius.  Persons in the positionof the plaintiff face a life where they will always be at a much higher risk of bone fractures than persons without the conditionand when such misfortune befalls them they will have to endure a much more protracted and difficult recovery.  In the course of herchildhood, the plaintiff suffered fractures of her bones on numerous occasions but they became much less frequent after 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  An indication of just how much of her childhood was spent in hospitals can be gained from the following list of her factures whichI have taken from the medical records:</p>    <blockquote>        <table style="width: 85%">			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">17-12-1986</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Facture of the left radius 				and ulna.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">1-5-1992</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Facture of the left femur 				and right humerus.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">29-4-1993</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Facture of the left lower 				femur.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">27-11-1993</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Crack fracture over the 				trochanteric area.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">2-3-1994</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Crack of the right proximal 				femur.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">7-5-1994</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Bilateral fracture of the 				proximal tibia and a fracture of the neck of the fibula.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top"> 25-7-1994</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Fracture in the 				sub-trochanteric area.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top"> 7-2-1995</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Fracture of the distal right 				femur and distal left tibia.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">6-10-1995</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Fracture of the distal tibia 				and femur.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="width: 23%" valign="top">27-8-1997</td>				<td style="width: 65%" valign="top">Fracture of the sacrum 				distal to S2.</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It was also necessary for her to undergo operations to correct limb deformities and these took place on 21 July 1995 and 14 September1995.  Since then the deformed condition of her limbs has greatly improved and since adolescence the development of her bones hasmatured and stabilized.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Persons with the plaintiffâs condition also suffer from curvature of the spine and this is treated by fusing the spine.  Suchan operation is delayed as long as possible for once it is done it prevents further growth.  The operation was performed on the plaintiffon 2 July 1996 when she was an adolescent and accounts for her small stature.  It also limits flexion of the spine and allows foronly movement of the back at the hips.  Despite being an adult, the plaintiff, as a result of her congenital illness and the operationsshe has undergone, is only 110 cm tall and weighs only 60 lbs.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  From her birth the plaintiff has been treated at Duchess of Kent Childrenâs Hospital and that is where she continues to be treatednotwithstanding that she is now, in terms of her age, an adult.  This is not surprising given that the staff there are very familiarwith her and her condition.  Furthermore, the reality is that, in terms of her physical size, she has the body of child.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Prior to the first accident her most recent fracture was in March 2004 when she was admitted to Duchess of Kent Childrenâs Hospitalfor a right scapular fracture as a result of her falling from her wheelchair and landing on her right shoulder.  This fall occurredwhen one of the front wheels of the wheelchair was blocked by a drainage cover and became stuck as she was being pushed down thepathway of her church.  On this occasion, the whole wheelchair also toppled over despite being under the control of another person. This was the first occasion that she ever fell from her wheelchair and no such incident took place again until the first accidentin February 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Persons with osteogenesis imperfecta have difficulty developing strong muscles in their limbs because they cannot do weight bearingexercises for fear of fracturing the limb.  Consequently they will suffer muscle wastage and hence may not be able to walk unaidedas their muscles are not able to bear their own weight.  The plaintiffâs arms are stronger than her legs and this enables her topropel her wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Despite suffering from this condition the plaintiff has not allowed it to overwhelm her and has made every effort to enjoy lifeas much as possible.  She says in her statement that she is âa cheerful person, positive and optimisticâ.  Although wheelchairbound, she still engaged in social activities with her friends and her fellow students.  She would go to the beach, attend barbecues,join in karaoke functions and attend parties.  Before the first accident, the plaintiff could take public transport on her own inorder to get to school or to go out.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Notwithstanding the limitations that her condition imposed upon her, she has sought to live a full and meaningful life and up untilthese accidents was able to do so without having to depend on others.  She is quite a remarkable young lady and she impressed mewith the way she has come to terms with the very difficult hand that life has dealt her.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The plaintiff is clearly an intelligent person who is committed to her studies.  Before the accident, she was enrolled as an associatedegree student in the Applied Social Work programme at the Hong Kong Baptist University.  She was admitted to this two year coursein September 2005 and had her studies not been interrupted by the two accidents, she would have graduated in mid-2007.  As it wasshe did not graduate until June 2008.  However, she was doing the associate degree as a stepping stone to enrolment in the full bachelordegree course.  She had hoped that her grades in the associate degree would be sufficient to enable her to gain entry to the secondyear of the full degree course.  But her studies were affected by her hospitalizations from the two accidents and though acceptedfor admission to the Bachelor of Social Work (Hons) in the 2008/2009 academic year, she only gained entry to the first year of thedegree course.  This course lasted from 2008 to 2011 and she is now about to graduate with a full degree.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Prior to the first accident, she was fairly independent in terms of her ability to perform what are known as the activities of dailylife (ADL).  She did not have to use the wheelchair within the home and could move around with the help of a cane.  She could batheand use the toilet on her own.</p>    <p class="heading">The First Accident</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 3 February 2006, the plaintiff was being pushed in her wheelchair by a friend along a footbridge that connected Wong Tai Sinshopping Centre to Lung Cheung Centre.  The plaintiff was journeying from one shopping mall to the other but Lung Cheung Centre wason a higher level than the footbridge and because they were on different levels, pedestrians would normally have to walk up a flightof stairs from the footbridge in order to enter the shopping mall.  To cater for disabled persons, a wheelchair lift was installedat the stairway.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  This wheelchair lift, which is no longer in use as an elevator has now been installed, was of the kind that ran up and down a railbeside the set of stairs and when not in use could be folded up so that it would be out of the way of other pedestrians using thesestairs and walkway. The lift was essentially an enclosed platform with ramps at the front and rear which could be lowered to allowwheelchair entry and exit and raised whilst the lift was in motion.  The wheelchair platform also had chest-high bars at the frontand rear which are raised to allow entry and exit from the lift platform but kept lowered whilst the lift is in motion.  With theramps raised, the bars lowered and the wheelchairâs brakes on, the wheelchair and its occupant can be transported safely in thewheelchair lift.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Once the lift completes its journey the ramp is lowered, the bar is raised, the wheelchair brakes released and the wheelchair thenmoves off the lift platform onto the floor at the top of the stairs.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The plaintiff says that when she arrived at the bottom of the stairs she pressed the intercom button to call the security guardsto come and operate the wheelchair lift.  Two staff of the defendant arrived.  The plaintiff says that one of those staff wheeledher onto the lift platform so that she was facing forward as the lift ascended.  In this position the front wheels of her wheelchairwere about three inches from the raised front ramp of the lift platform.  While the lift was in motion, one of the staff memberscarried the hand-held console that was connected to the lift and which contained its on-and-off switch, and followed the lift frombehind.  The other staff member walked alongside the lift keeping other users of the stairway clear of the moving lift.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The plaintiff says that when she arrived in the lift at the top of the stairs the security staff raised the bar of the lift butthe plaintiff believes that the staff did not raise it completely upright so that it stood at a right angle.  However in cross-examinationthe plaintiff accepted that she did not know this as a fact.  The plaintiff says she was then instructed by one of the two securitystaff to wheel herself out of the lift platform.  She was not given any assistance by the security staff who just stood to the side. The plaintiff commenced to do as she had been told but as she did so she says two things happened.  The first was that she noticedthe front bar that had been raised was moving slowly downward.  The bar was less than a foot from her head and she believed it wouldstrike her head as she exited the lift.  In response to this she applied sudden additional force to her wheels to avoid the fallingbar.  The second thing that happened was that as she urgently applied extra force to the wheels of the wheelchair in order to propelit faster, she felt an obstruction that was blocking the front wheels of the wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In her witness statement she described what happened next as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSuddenly, the front wheel of my wheelchair got stuck, causing me, along with the wheelchair, to pitch forward. I was thrown offthe wheelchair and onto the groundâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  She believes that the ramp of the lift platform may not have been fully lowered and that this accounted for the obstruction. However,she did not see the obstruction and so cannot say what was in fact the cause of it.  All she can, herself, say is that she felt somethingblocking the wheels.  The combination of the sudden additional force that she applied to propel the wheelchair faster, and the suddenhalt of the wheelchair as it encountered the obstruction, caused her to become unstable in the wheelchair and to lose her balance,resulting in the wheelchair falling forward and her body being pitched face forward from the wheelchair onto the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The staff members operating the lift did nothing to prevent the plaintiff from falling out of her wheelchair but this may have simplybeen due to their inability to react in time to the rapidly unfolding events.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The plaintiff maintains that whilst seated in the wheelchair she was secured by a seatbelt which separated in the course of theaccident. The plaintiff does not describe the buckle as breaking, but rather as coming loose.  Upon subsequent inspection by an occupationaltherapist no defect in the seatbelt or its buckling device could be found and the plaintiff continued to use it after her dischargefrom hospital.  This buckle was not changed until after the second accident when it failed again. It was then replaced by what theplaintiff described as an aeroplane buckle.  There is, therefore, no explanation for why the seatbelt did not perform its functionof restraining the plaintiff within the wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Counsel for the plaintiff suggests that the force of the plaintiff falling must have been responsible for the seatbelt separating. Counsel for the defendant suggests that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the seatbelt was not being usedby the plaintiff or that the plaintiff had negligently failed to properly secure it.  Either way, it is said, the plaintiff is guiltyof contributory negligence, should the court find that the defendant is liable for the plaintiffâs injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  No evidence in respect of the accident was called by the defendant and the plaintiff did not call her companion who was presentat the time the accident occurred.  A contrary version as to how the accident occurred was put to the plaintiff in cross-examinationbut was rejected by her.  Consequently the only evidence as to how this accident happened came from the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The Injuries from the First Accident</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On the day of the accident the plaintiff was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. Upon examination she was found to have suffered a fracture of the neck of the right femur and a fracture of the left femoral supracondylar. She was subsequently transferred to the Duchess of Kent Childrenâs Hospital where she remained for the rest of her hospitalisation. Amongst the operations she underwent and the treatments she received were closed reduction and screw fixation of her right hip,k-wire fixation of the left distal femoral and the application of a hip spica plaster cast which she had to endure for almost 3 monthsuntil its replacement on 20 April 2006 with an abduction brace.  Her recovery was prolonged because of her osteogenesis imperfectacondition and she in fact spent 7 months in hospital before her discharge on 8 September 2006. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  From 18 May 2006 until her discharge, she was receiving physiotherapy.  She began walking with support in August 2006 and in September2006 she was able to walk with a rollator for a short distance.  After her discharge, she continued to receive physiotherapy andoccupational therapy as an outpatient until her second accident in December.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In a report dated 4 April 2007, the plaintiffâs physiotherapist described her condition immediately before the second accidentand contrasted it with her position before the first accident.  She said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt her best rehabilitation status before another accident in December 2006, Ms Ho was able to walk with crutches under standbysupervision. Prior to the accident in February 2006, Ms Ho was able to walk independently with crutches at home. And the right hipand knees muscles strength and joints mobility have never regained fully.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The occupational therapist assessed the plaintiffâs ADL performance in November 2006.  This was done by rating her ability toperform 10 tasks which make up the Barthel Index.  Her pre-morbid score, out of<b> </b>100, was 90 and in November 2006 it was 86.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Her treating doctor, Dr. Poon Tak-lun, in a report dated 16 January 2008 assessed what her post-accident position would have beenhad the second accident not occurred, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦the anticipated present medical condition of Miss Ho but for the accident should be a static level of disability very similarto the level she had before the accident.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The plaintiff, through her counsel, has specifically conceded that had the second accident not occurred the plaintiff would probablyhave returned to her pre-first accident condition and before the second accident occurred was making good progress towards achievingthat.</p>    <p class="heading">The Impact of the First Accident Upon the Plaintiffâs Daily Life</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  After the first accident, the plaintiff found she needed to use her wheelchair to get around even at home.  She needed help withthe ADL and depended much more on her mother to take care of her.  She could no longer go out on her own and could no longer usepublic transport. She had to book a rehabilitation bus to take her to and from school or elsewhere.  As a consequence, she rarelywent out.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  She described her post-accident anxiety about falling from her wheelchair as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAfter the accident, I suffered from the disabilities as stated below:</p>        <p class="quote">d.  Constantly lived under the shadow of the accident, was worried about falling over again or hurting myself, feared going out, hadto wear a seatbelt while sitting in a wheelchair, moved at a slow speed whenever moving around in a wheelchair on the streets, wouldinspect the ground surface for obstacles or bumps before taking a step, and was often worried that the wheels on the wheelchair wouldget stuck again and cause the wheelchair to tip over.  I was also especially scared of going down a slope, because every time I wasgoing down a slope, I would be reminded of the accident and how the wheelchair pitched forwards and backwards.  Even a mere rampplaced in front of a door was enough to frighten me.  Along with the persistent pain from the injuries, I was under mental distress,and could not fall asleep at night.  Recently, I was referred to the psychiatric department for treatment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  However, she did not mention these fears until she saw a doctor on 4 August 2008.  His note of what she told him is simply:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦.she is now very agitated about going outdoor and she requests to see the clinical psychologist. I make the arrangement forthe patient.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The plaintiff said that she was finally prompted to reveal her anxieties to this doctor and seek treatment for them:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBecause by this time, it has been quite some time after the accident, nevertheless, the fear did not subside and I had nightmares.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  She subsequently had four sessions with a clinical psychologist which provided her with some assistance by did not get rid of herfears altogether.  To this day she says she is afraid of wheelchair lifts and avoids using them and avoids going to places whereshe would have to use them.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Thus at the time of her discharge, she claims that she suffered from exaggerated fears of falling from her wheelchair which resultedin her having, from time to time, episodes of anxiety when using the wheelchair.  She also said that at the time of her dischargeher body had not yet fully recovered and she still suffered from some residual stiffness in the hip.  This remained her positionwhen exactly 3 months after her discharge she suffered another accident that involved her again falling from her wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  As will become apparent from the subsequent description of this accident, the defendant had no physical involvement in it. Neverthelessthe plaintiff claims that factors materially contributing to this accident happening were her heightened anxiety in respect of therisk of her falling from her wheelchair, in combination with the residual hip and limb stiffness, both of which were sequelae ofthe first accident.</p>    <p class="heading">The Second Accident</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The second accident occurred on 8 December 2006 at Baptist University where the plaintiff was studying for a degree in social work. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was seated in the same wheelchair as she was in when the first accident occurred.  Theseatbelt was the same and she said she secured it.  She was being pushed from behind by a fellow student over a tiled pavement outsidethe departmentâs building.  The tiles had not been smoothly laid.  She felt anxious at the risks of falling and somewhat unstablewithin the wheelchair.  She lost her balance and again fell out of the wheelchair with the seatbelt again failing to restrain her. In her evidence-in-chief, she described the accident as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ: What made you fall?</p>        <p class="quote">A: At that time I saw a tile, it seems that it was rugged. (sic)</p>        <p class="quote">Then I became afraid. The whole of my body was moved forward, then I fell into the ground.</p>        <p class="quote">Court: Iâm not quite sure that I understand what is meant by âruggedâ. Do you mean sort of rough or uneven, or broken, or â¦.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Because the tiles were not evenly laid.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: So this time did you also fall face down?</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes, but this time my knees landed on the ground first.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that she had travelled on that path about 5 times before and was being pushed by a fellowstudent from her same class who was fully able and pushing her carefully.  It was between 5 and 6 pm and not yet dark and so therewas no problem with visibility. The weather was fine.  There seems to be nothing about the conditions or circumstances which wouldjustify the plaintiff becoming anxious.  The following exchange took place in respect of this second accident in the course of thecross-examination:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âQ: I am coming towards the end of my cross-examination. Going back to the second accident, December 2006, you already told us thatyou were pushed by â your wheelchair was pushed by a schoolmate or classmate.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: And he was pushing it carefully, must be.</p>        <p class="quote">A; Yes.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: Because he knew about your physical disposition.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: But somehow the front wheel or one of the front wheels touched a protruding object on the ground which was uneven.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: As a result you fell off from the wheelchair.</p>        <p class="quote">A: That was one of the reasons. Most importantly I lost my balance. My body inclined forward and the whole of me fell on the ground.It was because at that time I was afraid.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: We have heard all this already, but your buckle was on, definitely.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: Again, this time, the second time, this buckle failed you. It canât protect you.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Correct.</p>        <p class="quote">Q: May I suggest to you that the buckle was not on, is that correct?</p>        <p class="quote"> A:    It was on, definitely.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Injuries from the Second Accident</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The injuries that the plaintiff suffered in the second accident were less serious than those in the first accident.  This accidentcaused fractures to the right distal femur and the left proximal tibia and did not impact upon her previous injuries.  She returnedto the Duchess of Kent Childrenâs Hospital where she was again treated with a bilateral hip spica and discharged in March 2007.</p>    <p class="heading">The Impact of the Accidents Upon the Plaintiffâs Studies and Future Employment</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The first accident interrupted the plaintiffâs studies but the Baptist University allowed her to defer her studies for a periodof one year.  She hoped to transfer to the Bachelor degree programme and that her grades would be good enough to enable her to proceedto the second year of it.  However, her studies were greatly affected by the accident and, good as her grades were in the circumstances,they were not sufficient to allow her entry into the second year of the Bachelor degree programme.  However, she did gain entry tothe Bachelor degree course but had to start again in Year 1.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The combined effect of the two accidents has been to delay her completion of her degree by two years.  The plaintiff now expectsto graduate this year and aspires to work as a social worker.  This aspiration has been long held and notwithstanding the plaintiffâscondition this aspiration was not, pre-accident, an unrealistic one.  This is because, preâaccident, the plaintiffâs ambulatoryability was much greater than now and she expected that within the workplace she would be able to get around by the use of a cane.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  After the first accident, it was expected that she would enjoy virtually a full recovery and return to her pre-morbid position.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  However, after the second accident, her position changed and she now has much less ambulatory ability and can no longer use publictransport or taxis or go out on her own.  She also has much less ability to perform ADL.  This includes an inability to transferfrom wheelchair to bed or to toilet.  As a result, she needs the constant care of her mother who has been accompanying the plaintiffto school.  This will greatly reduce her chances of gaining employment.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In her second supplemental witness statement, the plaintiff described her current position as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt present, even though I go to school, my mother accompanies me as wellâ¦. I would try to drink as less water as possible inorder to avoid the needs to go to the toiletâ¦.. For some days that my mother cannot take care of meâ¦ I have no alternative butto ask my schoolmates whom I know well to assist me to go to the toilet. As I suffer from osteogenesis imperfecta and my bones willget injured easily, not every classmate is able to assist me. My mother has taught my several closest schoolmates on how to assistme to go to toilet. However, it is still embarrassing for outsiders to assist me to go to toilet. Therefore my mother would try herbest to come to school everyday to take care of me In the circumstances, I believe that this is the main obstacle hindering me fromworking in the community. As I am not able to take care of myself after this accident, I believe that, if there is no arrangementfor special occupational assistance, the chance for me to work independently is very slim.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  There is clearly a great difference between what might have been her position had the second accident not occurred and her positionnow after it has occurred.  The irony is that the injuries she sustained in the second accident were not nearly as serious as thosein the first accident but they have had a much greater impact upon her ambulatory ability and her ability to perform ADL.  Her reducedabilities in these areas necessarily impacts upon her chance of obtaining employment and pursuing the career for which she has studiedso long and hard.  As a consequence, many of her heads of damage are claimed on the assumption that the defendant can be held liablefor the occurrence of the second accident.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability for the First Accident</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The defendant concedes that it has a duty of care to users of its wheelchair lift but disputes that in regard to this plaintiff,who appeared to its staff to be accompanied by a companion and able to propel her wheelchair, that its duty extended to assistingthe plaintiff to enter and exit the lift.  Whether it had such a duty and if so whether the plaintiffâs injuries flowed from itsbreach of this duty are the central issues in respect of the defendantâs liability for the first accident.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The duty of care owed by the defendant to users of its wheelchair lift</i></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In cross-examination of the plaintiff by the defendantâs counsel the following exchange took place:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNow, by reading this last part of this paragraph your principal or simple concern or complaint was that the staff of defendantdid not wheel you out otherwise there would be no accident. Thatâs your complaint.</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Relevant to this complaint is the plaintiffâs evidence that on previous occasions that she had used this wheelchair lift the staffhad assisted her to enter and exit the lift.  And that, she said, was her experience elsewhere when using lifts of this kind.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Also relevant is the plaintiffâs evidence that in order for her wheelchair to be wheeled onto the lift platform, the person pushingher had âto press down on the handle of the wheelchair to cause front wheels to go upâ in order to surmount the lowered ramp.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Determining whether a duty of care exists in any particular situation was the subject of discussion by the Court of Final Appealin <i>Luen</i> <i>Hing Fat Coating &amp; Finishing Factory Ltd v Waan Chuen Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2011%5d%202%20HKLRD%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] 2 HKLRD 223.</a>  In its judgment the Court of Final Appeal endorsed the âforeseeability/proximity/fairness, justice and reasonableâ approachin which a trial court examines the foreseeability of damage, the relationship of the parties to each other to see whether it isso proximate as to give rise to a duty of care and whether it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of agiven scope upon one party for the benefit of another.  These are not discrete elements to be separately considered in a tick thebox approach.  Rather they are very much overlapping elements that should be used by a judge to guide him in exercising his judicialjudgment.  The Court of Final Appeal, at page 288, paragraph 30 of its judgment expressed it in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUltimately it is necessary to stand back and take a holistic view of foreseeability, proximity and the need to be satisfied thatit would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In the present case, the defendant argues that a duty of care that extends to being responsible for the safe entry to and egressfrom the lift platform should not be imposed on the defendant as the risk of harm coming to a wheelchair occupant in performing theseactions is not foreseeable and it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care of this scope on the operatorsof wheelchair lifts.  In support of this argument, the defendant refers to the absence of any such direction in the manual providedby the manufacturer of the wheelchair lift and all the safety features associated with the lift itself.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The defendant has made it clear that notwithstanding that the wheelchair is capable of being used without supervision, it will onlyallow it to be used under the control and supervision of its staff.  Consequently when a wheelchair occupant seeks the assistanceof the defendantâs staff to use the wheelchair lift, they are placing themselves under the temporary control of those staff.  Inthis situation, it seems to me that the staff would expect the wheelchair occupant to passively comply with their instructions andthe wheelchair occupant would expect to have to follow those instructions.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In these circumstances I am of the view that a duty of care is owed by the defendant to users of its wheelchair lift in the useof the lift.  And use of the lift encompasses entering onto the lift platform and exiting from it.  It seems to me quite illogicalto separate the entry and egress stages in the use of the lift from the general operation of the lift and that the duty must extendto the staff operating the lift being responsible for the safe entry of the wheelchair onto the lift platform before the commencementof the journey and the safe egress of the wheelchair from it at the end of the journey.  In my view holding the defendant to sucha duty follows inevitably from an application of the principles laid down by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Luen Hing Fat Coating &amp; Finishing Factory v Waan Chuen Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2011%5d%202%20HKLRD%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] 2 HKLRD 223.</a></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Of course whether there is a duty of care and what can reasonably be required of a wheelchair lift operator in discharging thatduty (i.e. the standard of care) are two quite separate questions. Although the duty is only to do what is reasonable in the circumstances,one of those circumstances, if not the key circumstance, is that the person to whom the duty is owed is a disabled person.  It isapposite at this point to note what is said by the authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 20<sup>th</sup> edition, at paragraph 3-70, page 220:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOrdinarily, the standard of care expected of a defendant is based on the assumption that others possess normal faculties, but whenit is known that a person to whom the duty is owed has some physical disability, for example only one eye, a higher standard of careis required of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  How disabled a particular wheelchair occupant may be will be unknown to the staff operating the wheelchair lift and will vary fromdisabled person to disabled person.  I think that other than in the most obvious and clear situations it would be imprudent for thestaff operating the wheelchair lift to make assessments or assumptions about the level of disability from which the wheelchair occupantmay suffer or about the ability of the wheelchair occupant to fend for themselves in terms of entering or exiting the wheelchairlift platform.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In deciding what might be required of the defendant in fulfilment of its duty of care, regard must be had to the circumstances ofeach individual case.  Clearly the safest course for the operators of such lifts is to take over the responsibility for placing awheelchair user on the lift and removing them from it.  If operators wish to eschew this responsibility then, in the event of anaccident befalling the wheelchair user, the actions of their staff will fall to be carefully scrutinised to see whether the staffdid all that could be reasonably expected of them in the circumstances to see that no harm came to the wheelchair user in that personâsuse of the lift.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Nevertheless, I do accept that it would be quite legitimate to distinguish between the stages of placing a wheelchair user on theplatform and taking the user off the platform and the stage of operating the lift in its ascent or descent mode.  I say this simplybecause in the entry and egress stages the wheelchair occupant and any persons accompanying him or her may be involved, under thesupervision of the staff, in both actions.  This is in contrast to when the lift is moving in ascent or descent mode for then thewheelchair occupant is wholly in the hands of the staff.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In determining whether there has been a breach of the duty of care by the conduct of the staff falling below the standard of carethat can reasonably be expected of them, it seems to me that it would be legitimate to take into account, amongst other matters,the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  the nature of the wheelchair userâs disability in so far as it is apparent or made known to the staff;</p>        <p>(ii)  whether it is possible to communicate with the wheelchair user;</p>        <p>(iii)  whether the wheelchair user is able to understand and follow directions; and</p>        <p>(iv)  whether someone is accompanying and assisting the wheelchair user.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Was the defendant in breach of its duty of care?</i></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The next issue that I must decide is whether the accident that befell the plaintiff was due to a breach by the defendant of theduty of care that it owed to the plaintiff.  For me to decide this issue I must come to a conclusion about how this accident happened. The plaintiff says that if the evidence does not allow of a positive finding as to how the accident happened then I should haverecourse to the <i>res ipsa </i>loquitur principle.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The only evidence that I have as to the accident comes from the plaintiff.  There is, therefore, no evidence to contradict whatshe said.  That she fell from her wheelchair is not disputed.  Nor is it disputed that she did so as she was trying to wheel herselfoff the lift platform.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  It is the plaintiffâs evidence that she was pitched out of her wheelchair when the front wheels of it encountered an obstructionas she was applying extra force to the wheels in order to propel the wheelchair faster.  She was doing so because she apprehendedthe risk of harm from the bar of the wheelchair platform which she believed was slowly falling down and might hit her head.  Muchwas made by the defendant of this perceived fear of the plaintiff and it was clearly the case of the defendant that it was not atall likely that the bar would have been falling down as the plaintiff thought and that the plaintiff was mistaken in her perceptionof the movement of the bar.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  However, I believe that the questions of whether the bar was falling down or not and whether the plaintiff was mistaken, unreasonablyor not, as to the movement of the bar, are really just red herrings. I say that firstly because there is no evidence that the plaintiffsuddenly applying additional force to the wheels of her wheelchair caused the accident. The plaintiff says that the accident occurredbecause after applying the additional force her wheelchair came to a jolting halt when its front wheels encountered an obstruction. On her account it was the obstruction that caused the accident and I have no reason to believe that had the obstruction not beenthere, an accident would still have taken place.  Secondly, the plaintiff says that she only started to propel her wheelchair tomove it off the lift platform after she had received instructions to do so from the defendantâs staff.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The plaintiffâs explanation that she was jolted forward when her wheelchairâs front wheels met an obstruction is, I find, aperfectly credible one.  Given her size and weight it would not take much to cause her to lose her balance and fall forward.  I acceptthe plaintiffâs evidence that she only commenced moving her wheelchair once she had been told to do so and that from her positionshe could not see anything obstructing her way forward.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  That brings me to the question of what caused the obstruction.  Here, on the evidence, the possibilities are very limited.  Thereis, of course, the possibility that the ramp had not been fully lowered. However there is another possibility that I should mention. Affixed to the floor at the top of stairs was a strip of rubber matting of the kind that is made up of rows of raised circles inorder to alert the blind or visually impaired of the presence of the stairway.  The defendantâs counsel suggested in crossâexaminationthat the gap between the rows of raised circles may have trapped a front wheel of the wheelchair and been the cause of the obstructionthat the plaintiff felt.  I find this a rather speculative scenario with no evidence that would allow me to accept it as a reasonablepossibility.  The front wheels may be small but there is no reason to think that they could be trapped in the way suggested.  A morelikely possibility is that the raised circles might have operated as an obstruction but for that to have happened the front wheelsof the wheelchair must have already travelled down the ramp and that downward movement should provide enough momentum for the wheelsto travel over the circles. I canât imagine the raised circles creating such an obstruction to the wheelchair that they would causethe wheelchair to come to a complete and sudden halt and the plaintiff to pitch forward so violently that her wheelchair fell forward. Also the plaintiff is likely to have felt the downward movement of her wheelchairâs front wheels as they traversed the ramp.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  After having reviewed the photos and the video of the operation of the wheelchair lift, I am satisfied that were the ramp not fullylowered it would obstruct the wheelchair and could bring it to a sudden and immediate halt.  Were that to happen I am satisfied,on the balance of probabilities, that such a jolting stop could cause a person of the plaintiffâs diminutive size to pitch forwardin the wheelchair.  When viewing the video reconstruction I was struck by the difference in size of the actor portrayed in the videoand the plaintiff and this, I believe, is the key to understanding how the plaintiff could be affected in such a dramatic way bywhat might otherwise be regarded as a comparatively small force.  Coming to a jolting stop in the circumstances that happened herewould probably not cause an adult person of average size and weight to fall out of the wheelchair.  But of course the one thing thatis quite clear about this plaintiff is that though she is an adult she has the body of small child.  I am satisfied that the rampcould have been the source of the obstruction in that it was capable of having the effect upon her that was described by the plaintiffand of thereby causing the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Of course, it could have been something other than the ramp but if so there is no evidence before me that would enable me to identifywhat else might have caused the obstruction.  To try and find another cause would be to enter the realm of speculation and that Imust not do.  I accept, of course, that the absence of any evidence as to some other cause does not mean that I have to find it wasthe ramp but it does increase the probabilities that it was the ramp.  I cannot see what else it could have been.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  If I am wrong in my approach to making this finding of fact I should say that I would have reached the same conclusion on liabilityby means of the application of the <i>res ipsa</i> <i>loquitur</i> principle.  The manner in which this principle is to be applied was discussed by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Yu Yu Kai v Chan Chi Keung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282009%29%2012%20HKCFAR%20705" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2009) 12 HKCFAR 705.</a>  At page 720, paragraph 43 Ribeiro PJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â43. Whether one uses the label <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> or one speaks (as Hobhouse LJ would have preferred) of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case, one is concerned with a rule regarding the proper approach to the evidence. It is an approach whereby, in cases where the plaintiffis unable to say exactly how his injury was caused but, consonant with his duty of care, one may expect the defendant to know, oneasks whether the evidence has raised a <i>prima facie</i> case against the defendant and if it has, whether the defendant has, at the end of the day, dispelled that <i>prima facie</i> case by providing a plausible explanation for the plaintiffâs injury which is consistent with the absence of negligence on hispart.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In my view the conditions precedent to the operation of the rule are present in this case.  First, the plaintiff is unable to sayexactly how her injury was caused.  Secondly, consonant with his duty of care, one may expect the defendant to know.  Thirdly, theevidence has raised a <i>prima facie</i> case against the defendant.  I say this because the evidence is that the accident happened when the plaintiffâs wheelchair encounteredan obstruction when the plaintiff, <i>in compliance with the instructions of the defendantâs staff who were supervising her</i>, propelled the wheelchair to exit the lift platform.  And fourthly, at the end of the day, the defendant has not dispelled that <i>prima facie</i> case by providing a plausible explanation for the plaintiffâs injury which is consistent with the absence of negligence on hispart.  The defendant made a considered decision not to call any evidence as to the accident and his cross-examination of the plaintiffdid not result in evidence being adduced of a plausible explanation consistent with the absence of negligence on his part.  In thesecircumstances, the proper inference on the balance of probabilities is that the cause, whatever it may have been, involved a failureby the defendantâs staff to take due care for the plaintiffâs safety.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  I should mention that in the course of his cross-examination of the plaintiff, the defendantâs counsel elicited from her the factthat her companion had told her that the wheelchair ramp was not fully lowered when she propelled herself out of the lift platform. This hearsay statement explains the plaintiffâs belief that this was the cause of the obstruction.  The defendantâs counselhas not objected to the admissibility of this hearsay evidence but has urged the court not to place any weight on it.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  This statement is untested by cross-examination and so I have no idea of what this witness actually saw and to what extent her statementto the plaintiff is based upon actual visual observation as opposed to after the event reconstruction of what she thinks must havehappened.  Given the importance of the evidence and the uncertainty surrounding its reliability I do not think that, in the circumstances,I should place any weight on it.  I have, therefore, for the purpose of making my finding on the cause of the obstruction, ignoredthe hearsay statement of the plaintiff as to what her companion told her.  I have made my finding solely on the other evidence beforeme.  Of course, I draw comfort from the fact that my finding that the cause of the obstruction was the ramp is not contradicted bythat hearsay statement but I do not make any evidential use of that statement in reaching that finding.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Having made this finding, it must follow that the staff of the defendant, in instructing the plaintiff to commence moving her wheelchairoff the lift platform when the platform ramp was not yet fully lowered, was in breach of the duty of care that the defendant owedto the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Was the</i> <i>plaintiff</i> <i>guilty of</i> <i>contributory</i> <i>negligence</i></p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The only basis for finding the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence is that she:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  continued to use the seatbelt knowing that it was defective;</p>        <p>(ii)  was not using the seatbelt on the day of the accident; or</p>        <p>(iii)  negligently failed to properly secure the seatbelt on the day of the accident.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The defendant, of course, bears the burden of establishing contributory negligence but not having called any evidence as to how theaccident occurred, relies upon the evidence of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  As to (i) there is no evidence that would allow of an inference that the plaintiff knew or must have known that the seatbelt wasdefective.  The plaintiff had been involved in another accident in March 2004 when her wheelchair toppled over.  On this occasionshe was wearing her seatbelt and she said that it did not fail her.  Between March 2004 and the first accident in February 2006 shewas not involved in any accident and so, prior to the first accident, had no experience of the seatbelt failing. Furthermore afterthe first accident the seatbelt was checked by an occupational therapist who could find nothing obviously wrong with it.  This iswhy the plaintiff continued to use it.  Yet it also failed to perform its function in the second accident after which it was replacedwhen the plaintiff acquired a new wheelchair.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I certainly accept that part of the plaintiffâs obligation to attend to her own safety includes using the seatbelt that was attachedto the wheelchair.  I also accept that the plaintiffâs obligation extended to checking that it appeared to be properly secured. I say this because, of all people, the plaintiff was the one who best knew and appreciated how vulnerable she was to injury.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The defendantâs counsel asks me to infer that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from these facts is that plaintiffeither was not using the seatbelt or had negligently failed to properly secure it.  From this his counsel says it must follow thatthe plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence.  However it must be borne in mind that this was not a case of the plaintiff fallingout of her wheelchair. This is a case of the whole wheelchair toppling over forward, not sideways, in the course of which the seatbeltfailed to secure the plaintiff within the wheelchair.  For the wheelchair to topple over forward suggests to me that the plaintiffmay have been initially restrained by the seatbelt so that as her body was pitched forward it carried the wheelchair with it.  Thisseems to me a more reasonable inference than that the seatbelt was not being used or was not secured properly.  Therefore, on theevidence before me I am of the view that the inference the defendant invites me to draw is not the only reasonable inference thatcan be drawn from the evidence and I decline to draw it.  It therefore follows that I cannot be satisfied that the plaintiff hasbeen guilty of contributory negligence and I find the defendant 100% liable for the first accident and for the injuries sustainedby the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The Liability for the Second Accident</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  As the defendant was not involved in the second accident, his liability is said to arise on the basis that but for the residualdisabilities from which the plaintiff suffered as a result of the first accident, the second accident would not have occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Before addressing any legal issues, I must first satisfy myself that the factual claims of the plaintiff are established by theevidence.  These are threefold.  First that  she suffered a stiffness of hip and limbs and a psychological condition which manifesteditself in recurring nightmares and an excessive anxiety when travelling in her wheelchair at the possibility of further falls.  Secondlythat these were sequelae of the first accident and that the defendant is liable for them.  Thirdly that these sequelae contributedin a material way to the second accident.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The evidence of the physical and psychological sequelae comes from the plaintiff and the medical reports.  The plaintiff was crossâexaminedon why she took so long to raise the issue of her recurring nightmares and anxiety for it was not until 4 August 2008, some 2Â½ yearsafter the first accident, that she raised it with those treating her.  It may be that part of the explanation was that the anxietymay have worsened after the second accident.  There was no evidence on this but it seems likely that if the condition existed beforethe second accident then the second accident taking place is only likely to have compounded her fears and anxiety.  It must alsobe remembered that she was in hospital until September 2006 and then within a few months the second accident happened and she wasin hospital again until 27 July 2007.  So it was in fact only about one year that she delayed in seeking treatment and I do not thinkthat is particularly significant.  Most people are reluctant to seek help for mental health problems and it is not at all unusualfor a person with the condition from which the plaintiff was suffering to think that it might gradually alleviate over time.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  As to the stiffness in her right hip and limbs that is clearly documented by the medical reports.  Her physiotherapist assessedthe plaintiffâs condition before the second accident and this assessment is quoted earlier in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  I am therefore satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, firstly that the plaintiff did suffer from the conditions that I havedescribed and secondly that these conditions were sequelae of the first accident and are therefore conditions for which the defendantis liable.  I am also satisfied that these sequelae were present at the time of the second accident. That, of course, does not meanthat these sequelae were the cause or a material contributing cause to the second accident happening.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The problem with the second accident is the plaintiff cannot really explain how it happened.  On the paucity of evidence adducedit appears to be an accident that should not have happened.  The plaintiff was being pushed by a fellow student and does not blamethat person in any way for the accident.  That person was pushing the wheelchair with apparent care and not at an excessive speed. True it was that the wheelchair was being wheeled along a path that had a rough and uneven surface.  This may well have caused acertain amount of jolting to the wheelchair but it is not suggested that, as happened in the first accident, the wheels of the wheelchairmet with an obstruction that caused the wheelchair to come to such a violently sudden halt that the plaintiff was pitched from it.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I have no evidence from the student who was pushing the wheelchair to assist me in understanding how the accident happened.  Theplaintiffâs explanation is:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  the path along which she was travelling was composed of unevenly laid tiles;</p>        <p>(ii)  this caused her to feel afraid;</p>        <p>(iii)  the front wheels of the wheelchair hit a protruding object; and</p>        <p>(iv)  the combined effect of these three factors was to cause the plaintiff to lose her balance and her body to incline forward;</p>        <p>(v)  thereupon the seatbelt failed to restrain her and she fell out of the wheelchair.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  On her own explanation there were a number of factors contributing to the cause of the accident.  They were the unevenness of thepath, her instability within the wheelchair and the failure of the seatbelt to secure her.  The test that is used to identify thefactual cause of an accident is referred to as the âbut forâ test.  It has been long accepted and applied by the courts of HongKong, for example by the court of Final Appeal in <i>Cheung &amp; Anor v Tse Wai Chun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%203%20HKCFAR%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) 3 HKCFAR 339.</a>  It is described by the authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 20<sup>th</sup> edition, at paragraph 2-09, page 57:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe first step in establishing causation is to eliminate irrelevant causes, and this is the purpose of the âbut forâ test. The courts are concerned, not to identify all of the possible causes of particular incident, but with the effective cause of theresulting damage in order to assign responsibility for that damage.  The âbut forâ test asks : would the damage of which theclaimant complains have occurred âbut forâ the negligence (or other wrongdoing) of the defendant?  Or to put it more accurately,can the claimant adduce evidence to show that it is more likely than not, more than 50 per cent probable, that âbut forâ thedefendantâs wrongdoing the relevant damage would not have occurred.  In other words, if the damage would have occurred in any eventthe defendantâs conduct is not a âbut forâ cause.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Assuming for the moment that the unevenness of the path caused her to have a jolting ride.  Assuming further that her psychologicalcondition caused her to be excessively tense within the wheelchair resulting in her becoming more susceptible to losing her balanceand less able to control her bodyâs stability and movement within the wheelchair.  Assuming all of this, what was it that reallycaused the accident?  Surely it was the failure of the seatbelt to restrain the plaintiff within the wheelchair.  I say this becauseon this occasion there was no toppling of the wheelchair and so if the seatbelt had properly performed its function the plaintiffwould not have had this second accident and would not have suffered these further injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  There is do doubt that the sequelae, together with the uneven pathway, contributed to the plaintiff becoming unstable within thewheelchair, losing her balance and her body moving forward.  But it was precisely to deal with situations such as this that the wheelchairwas equipped with a seatbelt and of course it was to deal with situations such as this that the plaintiff wore the seatbelt.  Inmy view the application of the âbut forâ test leads to the conclusion that it was because the seatbelt was defective that theplaintiff fell from the wheelchair, not because of the sequelae conditions from which she suffered from the first accident.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  There can of course be a number of causes of an accident or of an injury.  The plaintiff does not have to establish that the sequelaewere the one and only cause of the second accident; it is enough that it was a cause in the sense of materially contributing to it. (For a decision of the relevant principles see the judgment of Sakhrani J in <i>C M Y v Tam Siu Ching</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%204%20HKLRD%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 4 HKLRD 604).</a>  Can it be said that notwithstanding that the âbut forâ test would appear to exclude the sequelae of the first accident as afactual cause of the second accident, nevertheless the sequelae were, legally, a material contributing cause of the second accident.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  I accept that the sequelae contributed to making the plaintiff less stable within the wheelchair and more prone to losing her balanceand that as a consequence they rendered her more vulnerable to wheelchair accidents.  But there must still be a link to the injurieswhich, in respect of the second accident, were caused by her body falling out of the wheelchair.  The sequelae created the risk thather body might fall out of the wheelchair but it was the failure of the seatbelt to restrain her that transformed risk into reality. In my view, the failure of the seatbelt constituted a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> that broke the chain of causation that otherwise might have linked the defendant to the second accident.  The failure of the seatbeltwas not a contributing cause of the second accident â it was the only cause of it.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  It is my conclusion, therefore, that the defendant is not liable for the second accident.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  After the first accident the plaintiffâs recovery was slow but it was expected that she would return to her pre-morbid condition. That condition was that she could walk around her home with crutches and was generally able to take care of herself in terms ofADL.  She could use taxis and public transport and had a reasonable chance of obtaining employment.  Unfortunately that is not herposition now but the changes to her condition are the result of the second accident and the defendant, I have concluded, is not liablefor those changes.  The plaintiffâs counsel agrees that should the defendant be found not liable for the second accident then theplaintiff cannot claim for future loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity and her loss of pre-trial earnings should only befor one year.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Without the defendant being liable for the second accident the plaintiffâs heads of damage are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)  PSLA for the first accident;</p>        <p>(ii)  pre-trial loss of earnings of 1 year; and</p>        <p>(iii)  special damages other than future expenses arising from the second accident.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  However before turning to my assessment of the remaining heads of damage it is necessary to first address the issue of what discountshould be made for the fact that the plaintiff suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, which condition makes her much more vulnerableto suffer fractures of her bones.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Discount for the</i> <i>plaintiffâs</i> <i>pre-existing condition</i></p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  The law on this issue I take from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Liu Chun Kow Joe v Lee Sau Wing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%203%20HKC%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 3 HKC 433.</a>  At page 446, paragraph 36 the Court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â There are three possible outcomes regarding pre-existing disability of a plaintiff:</p>        <p class="quote">1)  The plaintiff would probably go through life without being affected by the disability. If this is the case the defendant wouldbe liable for all damage caused by his wrongful act.</p>        <p class="quote">2)  There is a strong possibility that some other event or natural progression of the condition would have brought about the plaintiffâspresent state. The court would then need to assess the degree of possibility in deciding what reduction is appropriate, as in assessingthe effect of their vicissitudes of life.</p>        <p class="quote">3)  The pre-existing condition would certainly lead to disability and loss in the future.  In such case, an allowance has to be made,the extent of which depends on the evidence as to when the precipitating event would have occurred.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In my view this plaintiff comes primarily within the second category though in a sense she could be said to straddle both the secondand third categories.  I say this because even though she is in the second category from the date of trial she was in the third categoryin respect of the second accident when risk of further disability became certainty.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  In the present case I am not concerned with future economic loss but only PSLA and pre-trial economic loss.  In respect of PSLAthe relevance of the plaintiffâs preâexisting disability is that it placed her at risk of suffering broken bones in the futurewhich, should such incidents occur, would impact upon her enjoyment of the amenities of life.  But given the purpose of the discountI do not see how the pre-existing disability can impact on the assessment of the pain and suffering component of PSLA or the lossof amenities of life up to the date of the second accident.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  This assessment is ultimately one which is based on the evidence.  That this must be so is a point made by Cheung JA in <i>Liu</i> <i>Chun Kow Joe v Lee Sau Wing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%203%20HKC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 3 HKC 443</a> when he said at paragraph 39, page 447 E-F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âJudges are not actuaries but their tasks frequently require them to make assessments of probabilities in quantitative terms basedon available evidence.

As a consequenceof her disability she always faced a future where her ability to enjoy the amenities of life was already significantly limited.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Nevertheless, as I have previously mentioned, the plaintiff is an extraordinary woman in terms of the positive attitude she possessesand the great efforts that she has gone to in trying to develop a normal life for herself.  Within the limitations that her conditionimposed upon her, the plaintiff explored and enjoyed to the full the amenities of life.  For her to suffer even a small restrictionor further limitation on her amenities of life is a huge loss.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In looking to her future and trying to assess the likelihood of future accidents I cannot ignore the second accident.  I regardthe second accident as evidence that as a consequence of her condition she is vulnerable to suffering fractures of her bones as avicissitude of her life, and these fractures could have the effect of further reducing her ability to enjoy the amenities of life.However balanced against that the plaintiff has not suffered any further accident since 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The plaintiff accepts that a discount should be made and suggests it should be no more than 30%.  The defendant submits that itshould be 50%.  However given the role which I understand pre-existing disability has on a PSLA award and taking account of the evidenceof the plaintiffâs condition and its impact on her life before the first accident, after that accident and now, it is my view thatdiscount of around 20% is warranted. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>PSLA</i></p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  The nature of the award for PSLA was described by Cheung JA in <i>Liu Chu Kow Joe v Lee Sau Wing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%203%20HKC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 3 HKC 443.</a>  At paragraph 11 on pages 438 I â 439 A of the report he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDespite the expansion of the scope of PSLA since 1950 (see McGregor) the award is still in the nature of an award for the discomfortand inconvenience suffered by a tort victim. Such discomfort and inconvenience are intangible in the sense that they are not easilyquantifiable in monetary terms and as such the court strives to determine what is the fair, reasonable and just equivalent in monetaryterms.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  I have described earlier in this judgment the injuries sustained by the plaintiff in the first accident on 3 February 2006. In summarythe plaintiff was operated upon after which she was kept in cast until 20 April 2006 at which time the plaster cast, metal wiresand screws were removed and replaced with an abduction brace.  She then started training and rehabilitation which included gradedmobilization and weight bearing exercises.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  As of 10 August she was walking in the hospital with a rollator.  Upon discharge on 8 September 2006, her Barthel Index score forADL was assessed as 83, compared to a pre-morbid score of 90.  By November 2006 she had improved slightly and obtained a score of86.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Dr. Poon described her hospitalization as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦although she had been making progress in rehabilitation after the February 2006 accident, she had to endure the pain and inconvenienceand risks of major surgeries for treatment of the injuries sustained from the February 2006 accident. During the period between February2006 and December 2006 her daily activities and studies had been adversely affected by the fact that her mobility was much less thanbefore February 2006; she had pain in the joints and surgical wounds; she had to go through frequent physiotherapy and occupationaltraining sessions; she had extra and unnecessary psychological stress; she had to be hospitalised for treatment; and she had to undertakeextra traveling to and from hospital which also increased her risks of further injuries.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  The slow healing of the fractures, the lengthy rehabilitation process with physiotherapists and occupational therapists all contributedto an unusually long period of hospitalization.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Nor should one just take into account physical matters such as the number of operations, the months spent in plaster cast etc. The psychological distress suffered by the plaintiff in the course of her recovery must have been considerable.  As she waited torecover so that she could get on with her life, especially her education, she must have felt considerable frustration at the slowpace of her healing and rehabilitation.  She could not rush the process as her bones have to become strong enough before physiotherapycan begin.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  The plaintiff had the additional worry during her recovery of possible vascular necrosis of the head of the right femur. Such washer concern that she consumed Chinese traditional medicine in order to prevent this happening. </p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  In my view this plaintiffâs hospitalization and rehabilitation cannot be equated with that endured by normal persons with similarinjuries.  Normal persons would not have encountered the difficulties in their bones healing that this plaintiff encountered.  Norwould they have been subject to as lengthy a hospitalization or as prolonged a period of rehabilitation.  In his book <i>Damages for Personal Injuries and Death</i>, John Munkman makes the point at page 37:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is a ground for increasing damages rather than reducing them if a man suffers from ill-health which makes the injuries harderto bear.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  The special difficulties faced by the plaintiff were described by Dr. Poon Tak-lun in his evidence as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSir, the bones are more brittle and they do not take implants as well, so the technical difficulties in doing the surgery is muchhigher. Second, since the bones are weaker, after surgery, we need protection â protective casts, or spica, for a much longer time.Third, we can only start training of the muscles at the later time, so the muscles would be much more wasted. Fourthly, the patient-- we cannot put up too much force in the muscles to train them because the bones are weakâ¦..</p>        <p class="quote">There are multiple fractures which are more difficult to treat and more difficult to recover and rehabilitate.  And finally, she ispsychologically more apprehensive to go through the training programs so that the rehabilitation program will have to take much longerand the final results area less optimal when compared to a normal patient.â</p>        <p>These factors make it difficult to compare this plaintiffâs position with the plaintiffâs in those cases that have been citedto me as comparable cases and reduce the usefulness of these cases as a tool when assessing PSLA.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In addition I must take account of the plaintiffâs residual disabilities from the first accident i.e. residual disabilities thatare unconnected with the second accident.  These were described by Dr. Poon as stiffness of the right hip and the left knee and theweakness of the muscles.  The plaintiff in fact has only grade 3 muscle power and Dr. Poon explained that this grading means a patientis able to do no more than lift the limb against gravity and would be âbarely able to stand for a very short time, may be justa split secondâ.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Dr. Poon also said that the plaintiff would now be more susceptible to fractures because she had less mobility and is less ableto keep her balance.  After giving this opinion the following exchange took place between the Court and Dr. Poon:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âCOURT: I donât have in mind so much whether they could -- the impaired balance might lead her to have more accidents. I havemore in mind as to whether should she have more accidents she is more likely to suffer more serious injuries and the injuries maytake longer to heal. Is there any kind of implication like that?</p>        <p class="quote">A. Yes, sir.</p>        <p class="quote">COURT: Iâm concerned as to whether that is what youâre saying, at page 190. I wasnât quite sure in that sentence beginning âSecondlyâwhat you mean and when you finish the sentence âand this could have contributed to the serious fracture suffered.â</p>        <p class="quote">A. Yes, sir. A bone that has healed from the fracture normally would take some time to regain mechanical strength before the accident.</p>        <p class="quote">COURT: But that will happen with every fracture, wonât it, simply because of her condition?</p>        <p class="quote">A: Yes, but because of her condition it would even take longer, if at all. So the bones are mechanically permanently weakened. Themuscles are also probably permanently weakened.</p>        <p class="quote">COURT: But thatâs a result of her condition, not a result of the injury she suffered in February 06.</p>        <p class="quote">A: All fractures would contribute to an accumulation of disabilities because no fractures can heal perfectly, and since the â¦</p>        <p class="quote">COURT: Sorry, they contribute to an accumulation of fractures.</p>        <p class="quote">A:     Yes, accumulation of the disabilities, and since the February 2006 injury was a particularly serious one, the resulting increaseof the amount of permanent disability would be quite significant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  The doctor also mentioned that these injuries from the first accident will also, in conjunction with her previous injuries and anyfuture injuries she may suffer, in due course contribute to her developing arthritis.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  The doctor accepted the possibility that the plaintiff could further improve in her recovery of her residual disabilities but, giventhe lapse of time since the accident, did not see this as a realistic likelihood.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  There was also the psychological sequelae from the first accident but this had largely subsided when she was assessed in August2009.  Her clinical psychologist then commented on her:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âShe no longer had intensive recollection of the accident and significant behavioural avoidance. She still had some physiologicalarousal in situations with risk of fall, but the reactions were understandable in her circumstances.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  The plaintiffâs counsel submits that this client should be placed in the âserious injuryâ category laid down in <i>Lee Ting Lam v Leung Kam Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20HKLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] HKLR 657.</a>  I agree, subject to the qualification that I would regard this plaintiffâs injuries, with all that she has been through in termsof hospitalization and rehabilitation when taken in conjunction with her residual disabilities, as placing her at the high end ofthe âserious injuryâ category.  I assess the plaintiffâs damages for PSLA at $520,000.  This amount must be discounted to allowfor her preâexisting condition, resulting in a final amount of $420,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Pre-trial loss of earning</i></p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The parties agree that the amount should be for a period of one year which the defendant calculates as amounting to $277,263, includingan allowance for MPF contributions.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Special Damages</i></p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  These amount to $26,360.40</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Interest</i></p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Interest on the award for PSLA will be at 2% per annum from the date of service of the writ to the date of judgment.
