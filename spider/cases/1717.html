As regards the two letters of credit, dated respectively the29th March and 8th April 1982, (in respect of (a) 10,000 yards and (b) 8,000 yards of corduroy), Howlap averred that they had originallyrefused to accept them because they did not cover all the contract goods but that they had agreed to deliver the goods that weredelivered on an undertaking given by lee Wah that a letter of credit to cover the remaining goods would be made available.</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> By their amended Reply, Lee Wah contended that there was no such condition precedent, express or implied and even if there had been,Howlap had waived it by accepting the two letters of credit in respect of the two instalments of goods delivered and were thereforeestopped from relying upon the alleged condition precedent.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The Judge came to the conclusion that the true construction of the contract was that the parties had contemplated that there couldbe delivery by instalments and there was a corresponding right on Lee Wah's part to open letters of credit for the instalments. Hethen went on to hold that even if the construction urged upon him on behalf of Howlap were the proper one, Howlap (through the conductof their managing director, Mr. Chan Kook-chu) had waived any such provision.

"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>       </p>    <p>Mr. Chan Kwok-chu, Howlap's managing director, had told the court that when the first letter of credit had been opened on the 29thMarch 1982 in respect of the first 10,000 yards of corduroy delivered, he had at first refused to make a delivery because the letterof credit should have covered all 30,000 yards of corduroy but he had been persuaded to do so by Mr. Lee Hon-keung of Lee Wah. Hehad drawn on the letter of credit as an act of indulgence. This is how the Judge dealt with this aspect of the evidence -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Mr. Chan claimed that when the plaintiff open its first letter of credit for 10,000 yards on the 29th March 1982, he at first refusedto supply any goods under it because it should have been for the full 30,000 yards, and it was only after persuasion from Mr. LeeHon-keung of the plaintiff firm that he agreed to supply 10,000 yards and draw on the letter of credit as an act of indulgence tothe .plaintiff firm. Even one such act of indulgence would have stretched my credulity somewhat, and I was even less impressed byMr. Chan's evidence when he sought to explain away the further delivery of 3,535 1/2 yards of material on the basis of yet anotheract of indulgence. Here was a man claiming to insist upon a letter of credit for 30,000 yards before he would deliver any goods,yet nonetheless, when two letters of credit for lesser amounts are isseud, he delivered goods under each of them. I did not acceptMr. Chan's explanation of the two deliveries of goods being acts of indulgence. The moreoreasonable explanation, and the one putforward by Mr. Lee was that. Mr. Chan was completely willing to accept the two letters of credit because the understanding betweenthe parties all along had been that letters of credit would. be issued for instalments of the goods."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It is also said on behalf of Howlap that in view of the findings mentioned in the paragraph I have just read, the Judge had beenwrong to accept Mr. Lee's evidence about the market price of the appropriate quality of corduroy at the material time, and that theJudge ought to have accepted the evidence called by Howlap on this issue.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The Judge said this about the general impression he had formed of Mr. Chan and Mr. Lee -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Not only was Mr. Lee's explanation of the letters of credit more inherently probable than that of Mr. Chan, but also, in general,I found Mr. Lee the more impressive witness and I preferred to accept his evidence to that of Mr. Chan. I am not suggesting thatMr. Lee was a perfect witness. Far from it. He was decidedly careless and forgetful in his evidence, but, nonetheless, I gatheredthe impression that he was basically an honest witness. I cannot say the same for Mr. Chan. The impression I gained of him was thathe was prepared deliberately to mislead the court in order to avoid liability on the plaintiff's claim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>I need say no more than that in my opinion Howlap have fallen very far short of discharging the burden of showing that the trial Judge'sapproach to, and assessment of, the evidence, and his decision on the facts, was wrong.

After we had indicated our preliminary view on the point ofjurisdiction to Mr. Chain during argument, he finally accepted the position and then applied for leave to appeal out of time. Thiswe refused.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Since I can find no merits in Howlap's appeal I am for dismissing it.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I now turn to the Respondent's Notice, but before I do so, it is necessary to recall that the Judge awarded Lee Wah dasmages of $14,818.95,which was the normal measure of damages on the findings of fact that he made. He held that Howlap had failed to deliver 16,464.5yards of corduroy at $6.60 per yard, in breach of contract. The market price was $7.50 Per yard and therefore the difference was$0.90 per yard: 16,464.5 x .90 cents = $14,818.05.[And so, if my arithmetic is correct Lee Wah received 90 cents more than the Judgeintended to award them!]</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The Judge's Order regarding costs was that Lee Wah should have their costs on the District court scale and that they should onlyhave half their costs calculated on that scale.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The Respondent's Notice was carelessly worded for, when read as a whole, it seemed that Lee Wah were not asking us to affirm thejudgment below on the grounds specified but, instead, to vary the decision to make an award based on the normal measure of damages.However, Mr. Leung, who appeared for Lee Wah before us, abandoned all the grounds of appeal except that in relation to the ordermade by the Judge as to costs. Later Mr. Leung also abandoned that part of the appeal which related to the Judge's order that LeeWah should only have half their costs (calculated on the District Court scale).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Leung submitted that there was no express provision in Hong Kong (similar to s.47 of the U.K. County Courts Act of 1959) whichallows the High Court inappropriate eases, to award costs on the District Court scale, but conceded that the High Court undoubtedlyhad jurisdiction to make such an order under its general discretionary jurisdiction relating to the award of costs. However, he contendedthat this discretion should be exercised upon the principles of the cases which discuss the application of the U.K. Act. He arguedthat the Judge had not applied the right test which was that stated by Glyn-Jones J. in <u>Hopkins</u> v. <u>Rees and Kirby</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%202%20All%20ER%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 2 All E.R. 452:</a> whether it would have been clear to a reasonable man in the position of the plaintiff at the time of the issue of the writ that nojudge would award more than <em>[</em>the relevant amount awardable by the County Court<em>]</em>. If that were not clear, then costs should be given on the High Court scale, although a lesser amount was awarded.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> This is what the learned trial Judge said (at pp. 141-142 of the Appeal bundle) -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Although plaintiff has won this case, I do not think it is entitled to the benefit of the usual order that full costs should followthe event. The comparatively small amount of damages that plaintiff has succeeded in winning indicates that this was a case moresuitable for the District Court than for the Supreme Court. I am therefore going to award costs on the District Court scale. Further,even on that scale, I am not going to award plaintiff all its costs but merely half of its costs. This is because a great deal oftime was wasted on account of plaintiff's case being in a confused state. About half of the trial time was spent on the issue ofestablishing whether plaintiff was entitled to damages for the loss sustained re the contracts with its sub-purchasers. For reasonsI have explained, it failed on that issue and should therefore be deprived of costs in respect of that.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">The effect of my order is that plaintiff gets only half costs, and even those are merely on the District Court scale."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I would say here that I am by no means persuaded that the judge exercised his discretion in a manner which this Court is entitledto interfere. If I may say so with respect, he made what I consider to b e an entirely fair and appropriate order in all the circumstances,and gave full and cogent reasons for his decision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Leung invited us to lay doom guidelines for the exercise of a Judge's discretion in such matters. Speaking for myself, I seeno necessity for this. Decisions of this kind can, in my view, safely be left to the wisdom and experience of the Judges.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> During the course of argument, we drew Mr. Leung's attention to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>) which is as follows -</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">  "(2)   </p>            </td>            <td width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">Where any proceedings in which the Court has jurisdiction are brought in the High Court costs shall be recoverable on such scale andin such amount as would have been recoverable if the proceedings had been brought in the Court, unless the proceedings were so broughtby leave of the High Court or unless the High Court otherwise orders."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I entertain no doubt that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 43</a> is not, as Mr. Leung suggested, concerned only with costs in cases where there has been a transfer of an action between the HighCourt and the District Court; Subsection (2) stands alone. What falls for decision, it seems to me, is what meaning should be givento the words with which that subsection begins - "Where any proceedings in which the Court has jurisdiction..." <em>[</em>"court" is, of course, a reference to the District court<em>]</em>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I regard <u>Solomon</u> v. <u>Mulliner</u> <em>[</em>1901<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20QB%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Q.B. 76</a> (to which we also drew Counsel's attention) of great assistance here. In construing the words "which could have been commenced ina county court" employed in s.116 of the 1888 U.K. County Courts Act (repealed), the Court of Appeal held that the test was not whetherthe amount claimed exceeded the jurisdiction of the county court, but whether the action is of a kind which the county court canentertain. <em>[</em>And see footnote No.3 to para. 720 of HALSBURY (4th Edition) Vol. 37<em>]</em>. A.L. Smith, M.R., referring to the words of s.116 I have just read, said at p.83-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I read them as meaning "which could 'properly' have been commenced in the county court," both as regards the character of the actionand the amount really involved. At what time is it to be ascertained whether the action is, as regards amount, properly within thejurisdiction of the county court? Not, in my opinion, at the time when the plaintiff is stating what amount he thinks fit to claimon the writ or statement of claim, but at the time when the amount recoverable is adjudicated on by the proper tribunal or otherwiseascertained by the result. It cannot depend on the amount which the plaintiff chooses to claim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Although the wording of our Ordinance is different, I consider that precisely the same principle is applicable, for the import ofboth sets of provisions is the same I respectfully adopt the reasoning of the Master of the Rolls of the day. I would therefore holdthat since the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Court at the material time was $20,000, and only $14,818 was recovered, thiswas an action which the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>. It follows that in accordance with these provisions, costs could only have been awarded on the District Court scale unless the Judgeotherwise ordered. I would add here that the cases which, apply s.47 of the U.K. County Courts Act are, no doubt, generally helpfulto the exercise of the judge's discretion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I would therefore dismiss Lee Wah's cross-appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(K.T.

It is suggested that although the inferences we were asked to draw from each passage would not individually suffice,taken as a whole, they showed the evidence of the plaintiff to be so unreliable that no reasonable judge could possibly have placedany reliance upon it whatsoever.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> There are cases in which the demeanour of the witnesses is of little value and an argument of this kind could perhaps more easilysucceed in this Court. In the circumstances of this case, however, the demeanour of the witnesses must have been of considerableimportance. Bearing that in mind I am by no means persuaded that the matters to which we were referred, even taken collectively,are sufficient to justify our interfering with the assessment of the judge and therefore with his finding as to waiver.</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As I read this finding, it is quite clearly a finding of what has been called in the course of argument a "limited waiver" that isto say, a waiving of the need for a letter of credit in the full amount, but not a waiving of the need for letters of credit. Buteven were that not so, and the waiver was of the former nature, the result would be the same. In either case the plaintiff is entitledto the full amount of damages which the judge awarded.</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The other point raised in the appeal concerns the market price upon which the judge based his judgment. That was also a questionof the assessment of evidence. There was some evidence from the plaintiff in support of the rate which the judge chose. I acceptthat it was not of the highest quality. But on the other hand, the evidence from the defendant had been rejected completely by thejudge, and the evidence of Mr. Cheung - on which the judge made no comment except to say that he did not accept it - is not all thathelpful. In the circumstances I am not persuaded that this court ought to interfere and for these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I agree with what my Lord Fuad J.A. has said in relation to costs, and for those reasons I would also dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.

Perhaps I shouldadd, for purposes of clarity, that as I, like my Lord Cons J.A., read the judgment of Rhind J., he found that what was waived wasthe buyer's obligation to provide a letter of credit for the whole of the purchase price as a condition precedent to the seller'sobligation to deliver. I also agree that it matters not how wide the waiver was, because in any event the sellers were in breacheither by failing to deliver such part of the goods as was covered by the second letter of credit or by failing to deliver the goodsspecified at all by the end of April 1982; which repudiations or one or other of them were or was accepted by the plaintiffs by issueof the writ.</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Turning to the cross-appeal I would only emphasize certain considerations of general importance relating to costs and they are these.In the absence of any express provisions in the Supreme Court Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>, equivalent to Sec. 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981,the jurisdiction of the High Court to award costs must be derived from the terms of Sec. 12(2) of the Ordinance. Then, turning tojudicial discretion, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 43(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, which is not limited to actions founded on contract or tort, is the Hong Kong equivalent of Sec. 47 of the County CourtsAct 1959. This section was not cited to Huggins J., as he then was, in <u>Tse Soon-cheung (No. 2)</u> v. <u>Ross &amp; another</u> <sup>(1)</sup>; to Rhind J. or to us. It is a section which I hope will be borne in mind by practitioners hereafter. For the reasons given by mylord Fuad J.A. the cross-appeal also must fail.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(M.
