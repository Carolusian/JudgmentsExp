Rich Life appealed against the decision of Master Lo and the appeal was heard by HHJudge Chan who allowed the appeal on 11<sup>th</sup> April 2008 and granted leave to Rich Life to defend.

I shall respectfully quote thefollowing from HH Judge Chanâs judgement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â1. [Shahdan], a subsidiary in the Henderson Group of companies, promoted a development in Kowloon known as Knutsford Terrace andKnutsford Steps (âDevelopmentâ). It was promoted as a unique dining and entertainment hub in Tsimshatsui, with specialty restaurantsand verandah and terrace space for open air dining. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">2.   By an Offer Letter signed by [Rich Life] on 29 October 2004, and countersigned for and on behalf of Shahdan on 12 November 2004,Shahdan agreed to lease Shop D of the development to Rich Life, for use as a deluxe ice cream shop. Under the Offer Letter, Shahdanalso agreed to grant a licence to Rich Life for Rich Life to use 2 kiosks immediately beside Shop D as an outdoor seating area inconnection with Rich Lifeâs business conducted in Shop D. Pursuant to the Offer Letter, the parties entered into a Tenancy Agreementon 8 June 2005 in respect of Shop D at the agreed rental of $100,000 per month. They also entered into a Licence Agreement on thesame day in respect of the 2 kiosks, at the monthly licence fee of $50,000. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">4.   In opposition to Shahdanâs application for summary judgement, Rich Life originally claimed that prior to its signing of theTenancy Agreement for Shop D and its signing of the Licence Agreement for the kiosks, Shahdan had made fraudulent misrepresentationsto Rich Life, to the effect that Shahdan had made an application to the Buildings Department for approval of alteration and additionworks to the Development, and that such application was being processed.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">5.   Rich Life claimed that it was only in December 2006 that it was discovered that no plans had been submitted by Shahdan for âthechange of useâ of the kiosks as seating areas, and that the kiosks were not shown in the approved building plans submitted forthe Development. According to Rich Life, it was informed by the Buildings Department by notice dated 27 March 2007 that the staircaselocated behind Shop D and on which the kiosks were erected was an illegal structure and had to be removed. Rich Life claimed thatas the Tenancy Agreement and the Licence Agreement were entered into in reliance on Shahdanâs misrepresentations, it was entitledto rescind the Licence Agreement which it did when it ceased use of the kiosks in August 2006. A draft defence along these lineswas exhibited to an affirmation of Mr Tong which was filed in opposition to the application for summary judgement. A counterclaimwas included to seek damages sustained by Rich Life as a result of the alleged misrepresentations.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">12. The Offer Letter referred to the premises to be leased to Rich Life as âNo D, Knutsford Steps (more particularly shown on thefloor plan attached â¦ and â¦ colored pink for identification purpose) of the Miramar Shopping Center registered at the Land Registryas Kowloon Inland Lot No. 6454 at Nathan Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloonâ. It also referred separately to an outdoor seating area of172 sq.ft. known as kiosk No. 1, and an outdoor seating area of 107 sq ft. known as kiosk No. 2, and Shahdan agreed to grant andRich Life agreed to take up a licence of these kiosks, which were colored orange on an attached floor plan. The term of the licencefor the kiosks was to commence one month after the date of issuance of either a Frozen Confection Factory Licence or Frozen confection/MilkPermit for Shop D. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">13. It is not in dispute that Rich Lifeâs ice cream shop opened for business at Shop D on 5 January 2005, after a Frozen ConfectionsPermit was obtained in December 2004. It is also not disputed that Rich Life took possession of the 2 kiosks in March 2005, and thatpursuant to the Offer Letter, the Tenancy Agreement for Shop D and Licence Agreement for the kiosks were signed by the parties on8 June 2005.â   </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> </b> It should be noted that the defence of misrepresentation was dismissed by both Master Lo and HH Judge Chan. Relying, among otherreasons, on the express terms of the Offer Letter, both Master Lo and HH Chan found that the allegation of misrepresentation incredible.HH Judge Chan comprehensively dealt with this defence in her judgement:  </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â27.   It may be that there is no implied term in the Licence Agreement that the area to be used by Rich Life is free of any unauthorizedstructure, and on the evidence adduced, I consider that the claims of misrepresentation made by Rich Life are incredible and do notsupport any defence. On the express terms of the Offer Letter, Shahdan does not warrant that [Shop D] are fit to be used for thepurpose of a deluxe ice cream shop, or any particular purpose, or that the kiosks are fit for any particular purpose or use proposedby Shahdan. Rich Life also agreed, under the terms of the Offer Letter, to be solely responsible for applying for all necessary licencesor approval required by any competent authority for the use of the kiosks as an outdoor seating accommodation, and to comply withthe regulations and ordinances for using the kiosks as an outdoor seating areaâ¦  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">30. On the question of the alleged misrepresentations, as raised in the affirmations made by Mr Tong, I do not regard them to be crediblefor the following reasons. First, although it is claimed that the representation made by Ms Chung (on behalf of Shahdan) in aboutNovember 2004 was that an application had been made by Shahdan to the Buildings Department for approval in relation to the alterationand additional works to Knutsford Steps which would give rise to Shop D and the kiosks, the terms of the Rider inserted by Rich Lifein the Offer Letter referred only to the requirement that Shahdan should obtain an acknowledgement letter from the Buildings Departmentwith regard to the approval of alteration and additional works for Shop D only, and not to the kiosks. The Rider expressly providesfor the remedies to Rich Life should such acknowledgement not be obtained by 31 January 2005, such remedies being Rich Lifeâs rightto terminate the Tenancy Agreement without compensation, and the right to a refund of the deposits paid under the Tenancy Agreement.These terms expressly contradict the representations allegedly made by Shahdan. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">31. Second, the alleged representations were all made after the date of the Offer Letter, and could not have induced the Offer Letteras alleged by Rich Life. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">32. Third, by 4 February 2005, Rich Life already knew that the kiosks might be illegal structures because they were unable to obtaininsurance on that ground, as its solicitors so advised Shahdanâs solicitors. Nevertheless, under legal advice, Rich Life finallyexecuted the Licence Agreement on 8 June 2005. Even if there were any misrepresentation, as alleged, it is quite clear that RichLife did not rely upon the representation allegedly made by Shahdan. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">33. As I have already observed in the course of the hearing, the parties to whom the alleged misrepresentations were made did noteven make affirmations to verify the alleged representations made to them. This casts doubts on the assertions made by Rich Life.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> </b> HH Judge Chan allowed the appeal on the ground of illegality. There are two aspects of this ground of illegality. The first one isthat there was no legal subject matter which could be licensed by Shahdan to Rich Life as when the Offer was signed on 29<sup>th</sup> October 2004, the two kiosks were not yet in existence. In rejecting this argument, HH Judge Chan said at paragraph 14 of the judgement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â14. â¦ The term of the Licence Agreement is expressed only to commence one month after the date of issuance of the Frozen ConfectionFactory Licence or the Frozen Confections Permit for Shop D, and such term in fact only commenced on 1 April 2005, after physicalpossession of the 2 kiosks had been delivered to Rich Life in March 2005. In the draft Defence exhibited to the affirmation of MrTong, Rich Life itself pleads that possession of the kiosks were handed over to Rich Life âin or about end of March 2005â. Theclaim made in these proceedings is for licence fees outstanding and unpaid from August 2006. Rich Life does not dispute that it wasin occupation of the kiosks until August 2006 when it claimed to have ceased use of the kiosks. The claim that the Offer Letter and/orthe Licence Agreement is illegal on the ground of there being no subject matter cannot be established even on Rich Lifeâs own evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> </b>  The second aspect of the illegality argument is that the two kiosks were unauthorized structures under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a>. HH Judge Chan observed that as gathered from a memo from the Buildings Department, it appeared that both Shop D and the two kioskswere located in and on unauthorized building work. Apparently it was on this basis that the application for the light refreshmentrestaurant licence for the business to be conducted in Shop D was refused. HH Judge Chan was of the view that Shahdan needed to pleadthe use of the kiosks which were unauthorized building works to support its claim for the licence fees. It was thus arguable that,as a matter of public policy, the court should not enforce the Licence Agreement. HH Judge Chan was not satisfied that there wassufficient evidence of all the circumstances before the court. As such, she ruled that the court should not determine the questionof illegality raised. Leave to defend was thus granted to Rich Life.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> </b> To complete the picture, an Amended Defence and Counterclaim was filed by Rich Life on 10<sup>th</sup> July 2008. The Counterclaim was amended whereby Henderson Real Estate Agency Limited (âHendersonâ) was named as the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by Counterclaim, Shahdan as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by Counterclaim and Chung Wai Man Sylvia (âMs Chungâ) as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant by Counterclaim. Ms Chung was an employee of Miramar Hotel and Investment Company Limited, which is within the HendersonGroup of companies. She was alleged to have make the misrepresentations to the representatives of Rich Life.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> </b> A Reply and Defence to Counterclaim was filed by Shahdan, Henderson and Ms Chung on 27<sup>th</sup> August 2008. A summons to strike out the Counterclaim under Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of District Court was taken out by Hendersonon the same day and, as mentioned at the beginning of this judgement, was allowed by Registrar Poon on 12<sup>th</sup> January 2009 and hence this appeal. </p>    <p class="heading"><b>The Law  </b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> </b> Although the summons of Henderson seeks to rely on three grounds to strike out the Counterclaim of Rich Life, the submission of Mr Wong, counsel for Henderson, does not rely on the ground of disclosing no reasonable cause of action. Thus the grounds being reliedon are that the Counterclaim is an abuse of process of the court or is frivolous or vexatious.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> </b> It is trite law that the court would only strike out the pleadings in plain and obvious case and there should not be any mini trialon affidavits.

Mr Wongsubmitted that those misrepresentations were in substance the same as those raised by Rich Life at the hearing before Master Lo andHH Judge Chan which were conclusively found to be incredible and gave rise to no triable issue. As a result, the Counterclaim shouldbe struck out. Mr Lai, counsel for Rich Life, countered that the issues before the court at the summary judgment hearings were differentfrom those before me now.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> </b> It is thus necessary for me to determine whether the issues decided at the summary judgement application were the same as those beforeme.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Newly Raised  Issues</b>  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> </b> Mr Lai submitted that the following issues (the âNewly Raised  Issuesâ) were newly raised and were not or could not have beendealt with or adjudged in the summary judgement proceedings:  </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the kiosks were non-existent physically at the date of the Offer Letter;   </p>        <p class="quote">(b) Rich Life was induced to accept the Offer Letter because of the assurances:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)  that Shahdan and Henderson intended to build and create a new chic, European style upmarket dining hub to be known as KnutsfordSteps;   </p>            <p class="quote">(ii)  that Shahdan and Henderson would apply and did apply to the government for building approval of the building works;  </p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  the misrepresentations were first made in August 2004 before the Offer Letter was accepted; </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) the true history and effect of the Rider;  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e)  damages for misrepresentations and breach of contract; </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f)  Shahdan as successor in title.  </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> </b> Mr Lai also submitted that the facts relating to the misrepresentations had a history spanning over almost one year. Every separateallegation of misrepresentation required a distinct finding of fact after all the evidence had been heard and assessed by the court.I pause to note that even though the misrepresentations had a history of spanning over one year, the court would only deal with themisrepresentations as pleaded. Pleadings are used to define the issues between the parties. To achieve that end, all the materialfacts must be pleaded. In a case where misrepresentations are the basis of the cause of action, each and every misrepresentationupon which Rich Life intends to rely must be pleaded. The court would deal with the pleaded case accordingly.  </p>    <p class="heading">Non-existence of the Two Kiosks   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> </b> This submission is incorrect because in paragraph 4(7) of the Draft Defence and Counterclaim exhibited to the Supplemental Affirmationof Mr Tong Hon Wah Harold, it is pleaded that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the course of the negotiations, the Defendant was given to understand that the Plaintiff intended to carry out alteration andaddition works (âthe Building worksâ) to Knutsford Steps which would <i>give rise to</i> the Premises and the License Area.â  (<i>my italics</i>) </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> </b> In my view, it must be implicit in the phrase âgive rise toâ that the kiosks (i.e. the License Area as defined in the Statementof Claim) did not exist and would come into existence after the alteration and addition works. Thus, the non-existence of the kiosksis not a newly raised issue. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> </b> The issue of non-existence of the two kiosks was dealt with by HH Judge Chan in the context of whether there was any defence to theclaim of Shahdan for licence fees since August 2006 when there was no dispute that Rich Life was in occupation of the two kiosksuntil August 2006. It was in this context that it was ruled that the non-existence of the two kiosks at the time of the Offer Letterwas not a defence to the claim of Shahdan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> </b> The present context is different as the existence of the two kiosks is, if my understanding of Rich Lifeâs case is correct, partof the misrepresentation. I, however, do not think this is a misrepresentation as it is pleaded in paragraph 20 of the Amended Defenceand Counterclaim that the two directors of Rich Life had been informed that âMiramar Hotel would build, amongst other things anew shop and two kiosks on the open flight of steps (to be reinvented as âThe Knutsford Stepsâ) by the side of the Miramar arcadefor the purpose of letting to an up-market design label ice-cream house.â Although when this piece of information was conveyedis not clearly pleaded, it could be gathered from the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that it must have taken place before the signingof the Offer Letter. Rich life, therefore, on its pleaded case, knew of the non-existence of the two kiosks before the Offer Letterwas signed.   </p>    <p class="heading">The Assurances</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> </b> Mr Lai submitted that the assurances were newly raised issues.  The first assurance relates to the creation of an upmarket dininghub. I do not agree that this assurance is a newly raised issue although it is not pleaded in the Draft Defence and Counterclaim.In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the first affirmation of Tong Hon Wah Harold of Rich Life filed on 18<sup>th</sup> January 2007, it is stated that at a meeting between the representatives of Shahdan and Rich Life in late August 2004, the representativesof Shahdan represented that Shahdan âhad designed and presented a concept of creating a mid-to-up market an exclusive venue forEuropean fine dining, specialty restaurants and barsâ. Thus, the first assurance had been raised as a representation. HH JudgeChan referred to âa unique and entertaining hubâ and âspecial restaurantsâ in paragraph 1 of the judgement. The fact thatthe assurance is not pleaded in the Draft Defence and Counterclaim does not mean that it has not been raised or dealt with, particularlyin a summary judgment application where defence is yet to be filed and the application could always be determined upon affidavitevidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> </b> However, I do not find in the Amended Defence and Counterclaim any plea embodying the 1<sup>st</sup> assurance set out in paragraph 15(b)(i) above. The closest I could find are the following pleas: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  ââ¦ [Ms Chung] orally informed Pang and Or that Miramar Hotel would build, amongst other things a new shop and two kioskson the open flight of steps (to be reinvented as âThe Knutsford Stepsâ) by the side of the Miramar arcade for the purpose ofletting to an up-market design label ice-cream house â¦â (para. 20)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) âIn a second follow-up meeting about one week later [Ms Chung] gave [Rich Life] floor plans, design perspective plans and colourfulpamphlets with very high power text extolling the superior air of European culture in the project â¦â (para. 21)  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  ââ¦ The Defendantsâ [by Counterclaim] representation of creating an up-market European style fashionable retail hub on theKnutsford Steps also did not materialize â¦â (para. 35) </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) âFurther or alternatively it was an express or alternatively implied term of contract that the premises and the licensed areawould be lawful estates and part of a new, up-market, European style fine dining place to be created by the Defendants [by Counterclaim]which would be plied with quality customers â¦â (para. 37) This plea bears some resemblance to the 1<sup>st</sup> assurance. But this is pleaded as a term of the contract not as a representation.   </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> </b> I am not satisfied that the Amended Defence and Counterclaim contains a plea embodying the 1<sup>st</sup> assurance contended. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> </b> The second assurance set out in paragraph 15(b)(ii) above relates to the application to government for approval for building work.In paragraphs 4(7), (8), (10), (12) and (13) of the Draft Defence and Counterclaim, it is pleaded that:  </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(7)    In the course of the negotiations, the Defendant was given to understand that the Plaintiff intended to carry out alterationand addition works (âthe Building worksâ) to Knutsford Steps which would give rise to the Premises and the License Area.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(8)  The Building works were proposed, designed and to be carried out by [Shahdan] which would be responsible for obtaining all necessaryapprovals from government authorities including the Buildings Department.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(10)    In or about November 2004, Miss Chung represented to Mr Pang Man Ho (âMr Pangâ), director of [Rich Life], and Miss OrYi Tung (âMss Orâ), Managing Director of [Rich Life] that an application for Buildings Department approval in relation to theBuilding Works had been made to and was being processed by the Buildings Department (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> Representationâ). Miss Chung even anticipated that necessary approval would be obtained prior to 31<sup>st</sup> January 2005. [Rich Life] was led into a reasonable expectation that necessary approval was likely to be obtained.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(12)    In or about December 2004, [Rich Life] successfully obtained a Frozen Confections Permit from the FEHD. The ice-cream shopnamed âDa Dolceâ formally opened for business on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2005.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(13)    By that time, [Shahdan] however indicated that possession of the License Area was still unable to be delivered. When [RichLife] requested Mr Chan Fun Kei â¦, the representative of [Shahdan], for documents from the Buildings Department showing the necessaryapproval had been granted in relation to the Building works, Mr Chan represented that the approval application was still being processedwhich would normally take quite some time (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> representationâ).â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> </b> Again, the second assurance, which is termed as the 1<sup>st</sup> Representation, has been raised in the Draft Defence and Counterclaim and is not a newly raised issue. There may be an ambiguityas to when the representation referred to in the above quoted paragraph 4(10) was made. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the judgement of MasterLo clarify that counsel for Rich Life advocated that âin about Novemberâ covered 29<sup>th</sup> October 2004 (the date on which Rich Life signed the Offer Letter). This was accepted by Master Lo. In any event, these are the matterstaken by HH Judge Chan to be the âfraudulent misrepresentationsâ made to Rich Life (see paragraph 4 of HH Judge Chanâs judgement).</p>    <p class="heading">Time when the Representations were made</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> </b> Mr Lai submitted that in the Draft Defence and Counterclaim, it was incorrectly pleaded that the representations were made afterthe Offer Letter had been signed when in fact the representations were first made in August 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> </b> I pause to note that paragraph 25 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim pleads that the relationship between the parties was actuallygoverned by the Offer Letter but not the subsequent Licence Agreement and the Tenancy Agreement. If that is the position of RichLife, all representations made after the Offer Letter would be irrelevant. That would include the 2<sup>nd</sup> representation pleaded in paragraph 4(13) in the Draft Defence and Counterclaim and the representations pleaded in paragraphs 26-32of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim. In any event, HH Judge Chan dealt with the representations after the signing of the OfferLetter in paragraph 32 of the judgement quoted in paragraph 6 above. I respectfully agree and adopt the reasoning.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> </b> I would add that I find the contention that the Offer Letter instead of the Licence Agreement or the Tenancy Agreement was the documentgoverning the relationship between the parties unconvincing. In fact, I do not think Mr Lai had put forward any argument in supportof this contention at all. For a start, this argument was not raised at all at the stage of the summary judgement application wherethe claim of Shahdan was entirely based on the Licence Agreement. Further, both the Licence Agreement and the Tenancy Agreement containan âentire agreement clauseâ. Without expressing any view on the effects of the âentire agreement clauseâ, I would have thoughtthat any sensible argument would be advocating the Licence Agreement and the Tenancy Agreement as the governing documents but notthe other way round.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> </b> It is quite clear that the timing of the misrepresentations is only one of the reasons why the defence of misrepresentations wasnot accepted by HH Judge Chan. There are other equally, if not more, compelling reasons in rejecting misrepresentations as a defence.To that extent, the timing of the representations dose not change any aspect of the case. If necessary, I shall respectfully adoptthe reasoning of HH Judge Chan in rejecting the defence of misrepresentation. </p>    <p class="heading">History and effect of the Rider  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> </b> In paragraph 24 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the history of the Rider is explained. Rich Life proposed in the rider thatif food licence was not granted by the government through no fault of Rich Life, Rich Life could terminate the tenancy. This wasrejected by Shahdan who put forward its version of the rider whereby if Shahdan failed to obtain acknowledgement from the BuildingsDepartment on or before 31<sup>st</sup> January 2005, Rich Life could terminate the tenancy agreement. It is further pleaded that Ms Chung persuaded the representative ofRich Life that the two versions were more or less the same as it was expected that the government confirmation would be obtainedbefore the January 2005 deadline. Also pleaded in paragraph 24 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim is the fact that the representativeof Rich Life was led to believe that the pending application also covered the two kiosks as it was repeatedly emphasised by Ms Chungthat the tenancy of Shop D and the kiosks were not severable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> </b> These appear to be matters not raised in the summary judgement application. But it is more apparent than real. In my view, what isimportant is what Rich Life understood the representations meant. Otherwise, a party could always amend his pleading by adding somemore facts to make it appear to be different from the pre-amendment version. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> </b> It is pleaded in paragraph 25 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that Rich Life âunderstood the representations aforesaidmean that Henderson would submit and had in fact submitted design and building plans for modification of land use to the governmentfor approval, and permission to commence buildings works was only a pending formality.â But such an understanding has actuallybeen pleaded in paragraph 4(10) of the Draft Defence and Counterclaim in which it is stated that Rich Life âwas led into a reasonableexpectation that necessary approval was likely to be obtained.â There is nothing new in this issue.  </p>    <p class="heading">Damages for Misrepresentations and Breach of Contract  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> </b> Mr Lai submitted that the two assurances and the damages for misrepresentations or breach of contract were not raised in the draftDefence and Counterclaim at the stage of the summary judgment application and escaped the attention of the court. Damages for misrepresentationsor breach of contract would only be considered after liability has been established. So far, all proceedings are related to the issueof liability. I do not see how they affect or are relevant to the application before the court. </p>    <p class="heading">Successor in Title   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> </b> Mr Lai suggested that Shahdan was a successor in title of Henderson. Nothing pleaded in the Counterclaim of Rich Life says anythingabout how Shahdan became the successor in title of Henderson. Mr Lai explained that Rich Life entered into various agreements onlybecause of Henderson, which was a well-known company compared with Shahdan which was an unknown company. In other words, they hadfaith in Henderson and was attracted to the idea as put forward. They thus invested heavily in the enterprise. When later Rich Lifewas required to enter into the formal Licence Agreement and Tenancy Agreement, it then realized that Shahdan was the contractingparty. Mr Lai argued that Shahdan became the successor in title because Shahdan took the benefits of the Licence Agreement and theTenancy Agreement by receiving the licence fees and rents under the Licence Agreement and the Tenancy Agreement. No authorities werecited in support of this submission. I think the fact that Shahdan received the benefits was, at best, merely a result of being asuccessor in title not the legal process whereby it became the successor in title.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> </b> It is also pleaded in paragraph 17 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that Shahdan had adopted the tort of Henderson and MsChung. There is no explanation as to how the adoption came about.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> </b> As employer of Ms Chung, Henderson could be vicariously liable for the tortious act of Ms Chung if the same was committed in thecourse of her employment. I do not see how the fact of Shahdan being a successor in title would be relevant to the liability of Henderson.Certainly, no authorities were cited in support. I could not accept this contention. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> </b> In my view, this argument simply could not be right. If Shahdan, as Rich Life subsequently realized and as submitted by Mr Lai, wasthe contracting party, how could Shahdan be the successor in title of Henderson who had never been the contracting party? Assumingfor a moment that Henderson was the contracting party, without a proper assignment of the Licence Agreement and the Tenancy Agreement(or the Offer Letter which, according to Rich Life, is the governing document) from Henderson to Shahdan, Shahdan could not becomethe successor in title. If Shahdan had somehow become the successor in title of Henderson by, as submitted by Mr Lai, taking thebenefits of the various agreements, should Shahdan not also have assumed the liabilities under those agreements so that Hendersonwould be now out of the picture?  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> </b> In any event, I am satisfied, from the discussion below relating to the agency principle, that Shahdan had all along been the contractingparty to the Offer Letter, Tenancy Agreement and the Licence Agreement and that Henderson signed all these documents as agent ofShahdan and did not assume any personal liabilities. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> </b> To sum up from the discussion above, I do not agree with Mr Laiâs submission that Rich Life has in substance raised new mattersby way of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim. The Newly Raised Issues are irrelevant or have been raised before in the summaryjudgement application. I am satisfied that there are no real or practical differences between the matters raised in the summary judgementapplication and the Amended Defence and Counterclaim. If Rich Life wants to challenge the ruling on misrepresentations, it shoulddo so by filing a cross appeal against HH Judge Chanâs judgement.  </p>    <p class="heading"><b>Issue Estoppel   </b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> </b> Mr Wong submitted that the doctrine of issue estoppel applied to the present case so that it would be an abuse of process for RichLife to re-litigate the same issues that had been determined by Master Lo and HH Judge Chan. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> </b> In the present case, Rich Life raised the issue of misrepresentation as one of the defences to the claim of Shahdan. The defencewas dismissed by Master Lo and HH Judge Chan as being incredible in the summary judgement application. Since the Counterclaim ofRich Life is entirely based on misrepresentation, if Rich Life is precluded from raising this issue, it would effectively mean thatthere would not be any cause of action that could be maintained against Henderson by way of Counterclaim. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> </b> As I have held earlier in this judgement that some of the Newly Raised Issues have been raised before or are not pleaded or are irrelevant,<i>prima facie</i>, the principle of <i>res judicata</i> applies. If I am wrong, I have to determine whether the wider principle of <i>res judicata</i> applies in the sense that those Newly Raised Issues should have been raised at the summary judgement application.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> </b> Mr Wong suggested that the doctrine of issue estoppel would operate in subsequent proceedings in the same suit and thus parties tothe same proceedings were bound by the conclusive findings made by the court in the earlier interlocutory applications.

The second policy is wider: it is concerned with the interests ofthe state. There is a general public interest in the same issue not being litigated over again.

The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party shouldnot be twice vexed in the same manner. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in theconduct of litigation, in the interest of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defencein later proceedings may, without more, amount to an abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse)that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if was to be raised at all. I would not accept thatit is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decisionor some dishonesty, <i>but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive</i>, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment ofa party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, soas to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what shouldin my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgement which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takesaccount of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusingor abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensivelylist all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is tobe found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedingsan issue which could or should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appearsthat the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim. While the result, may often be the same,it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a partyâs conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conductis an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances.â (Emphasis added byStock JA) </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> </b> His Lordship concluded at paragraph 61 of the judgement that the court would look at all the circumstances to determine whether acollateral attack was manifestly unfair or an affront to the administration of justice in the minds of right-thinking people. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> </b> Coming back to the present case, the explanations of Rich Life on its failure to raise the issues are set out in a letter dated 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2008 from the present solicitors for Rich Life to the solicitors for Shahdan (p.379-381 of the Bundle). In short, the inadequaciesof the evidence of Rich Life at the stage of the summary judgement application are admitted and the previous legal team is blamedfor giving wrong legal advice. Mr Lai further explained from the Bar table that Rich Life did not want to have any adverse cost orderby filing further affidavit evidence at a late stage of the summary judgement appeal before HH Judge Chan.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> </b> Where do these explanations lead to? In China North Industries Investment Limited, the court had to determine whether raising ofan issue in subsequent proceedings after some newly discovered evidence would be caught by the principle of estoppel, Stock JA observedas follows:  </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â68.   The basis upon which the discovery of new material might, in cases of estoppel, avail a plaintiff, and the circumstancesin which it will not, are these:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIf the party can show that at the time of the former proceedings he was excusably ignorant of some matter, which would have alteredthe whole aspect of the case, he is entitled to claim that no issue estoppel shall take effect against him. The estoppel howeverstands if there was no newly discovered fact, if it was newly discovered only in the sense that the party realised its importance,if the party had actual knowledge of the fact or might with reasonable diligence have acquired such knowledge, or if it was not sufficientlymaterial.â </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley â<i>Res Judicata</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">69.

It could be gathered that the true difference between the case put forward at the summary judgementapplication and the Newly Raised Issues is one of degree but not one of kind in the sense that more detailed accounts of the eventsare now put forward. But the substance is the same. It is not a case where new evidence or new documents were discovered that triggereda new approach to the proceedings. The ânewâ facts covered by the Newly Raised Issues were within the knowledge of the staffof Rich Life. I would thus answer this question in the negative. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> </b> Alternatively, those facts were newly discovered only in the sense that the importance of those facts was subsequently realized bythe new legal team. In any event, I do not think that the Newly Raised Issues âwould have altered the whole aspect of the caseâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> </b> The explanation contained in the said letter from the previous solicitors of Rich Life dated 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2008 is simply unconvincing and inadequate. Mr Lai argued that Rich Life should not be regarded as abusing the legal processas it acted according to the legal advice of the lawyers. I am sceptical of this argument because otherwise all legally representedlitigants would be immune from the doctrine of estoppelwhereas the unrepresented litigants could not enjoy this advantage. Takento the extreme, a party could avoid the doctrine of estoppel by changing his legal team at different stages of the proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> </b> Nor is the blame put on the previous team of lawyers entirely correct as Mr Lai who appeared before me today also appeared beforeHH Judge Chan in the summary judgement application appeal hearing. Rich Life was the appellant when the appeal was heard by HH JudgeChan. One would have thought that Rich Life would have put all relevant matters in the appeal in order to succeed in the appeal.When the summary judgement application appeal was heard by HH Judge Chan, the counterclaim based on the misrepresentations had alreadybeen put into the Draft Defence and Counterclaim. The significance of this is that Rich Life, being legally represented, must knowthat since both its defence and counterclaim depended on the same misrepresentations, failure to defend the summary judgement applicationwould basically mean the end of the counterclaim as well. In these circumstances, it is crucial to the case of Rich Life that allmaterial facts must be put before HH Judge Chan. Mr Laiâs explanation from the Bar table that Rich Life was prepared to take therisk and decided not to file further affirmation to put forward the whole case for the appeal would, if accepted as evidence, evenrender Rich Lifeâs position less tenable. For it would then be an informed and considered choice on the part of Rich Life. Finalityof litigation requires that a party should not put forward his case by instalments. If Rich Life made an informed choice of not puttingforward the whole case, it must be prepared to face the results of its decision which might not be the same it hoped for. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> </b> Furthermore, if Rich Life were to impeach the ruling on misrepresentations against it so as to preserve the Counterclaim based onthe same set of facts, the impeachment must be done by way of cross appeal against the decision of HH Judge Chan and by putting forwardthe Newly Raised Issues although it must be doubtful that it could satisfy the stringent tests in <i>Ladd v Marshall</i>. Thus it is even more important that all the relevant facts should have been put forward before HH Judge Chan when leave to filefurther evidence would usually be more readily granted. Allowing Rich Life to raise the misrepresentations in the Counterclaim wouldbe tantamount to allowing it to attack the judgement of HH Judge Chan and the Court of Appeal through the back door. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> </b> Another disadvantage of allowing Rich Life to continue with the Counterclaim is that there would be the possibility of conflictingjudgements on the issue of misrepresentations which would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> </b> Furthermore, as noted by Stock JA in paragraph 73 of the judgement, a re-run of the case meant that judicial time and resources wouldbe engaged; âa fact that should sit ill with the right-minded observer in the absence of good reason for the proposed exerciseâ.The same could be said in our case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> </b> I am, therefore, satisfied that the raising of the misrepresentations in the Counterclaim would bring the administration of justiceto disrepute. It would also be manifestly unfair to Henderson who, as far as the contractual claim of Rich Life is concerned, wasonly an agent in the transactions between Shahdan and Rich Life. As to the tortious claim of Rich Life, Henderson should not be forcedto be a party to the present action when the alleged misrepresentations are, based on the discussion in this judgement, plainly unarguable.The estoppel, therefore, stands against Rich Life even though Henderson is not a party to the summary judgement application.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> </b> Moreover, as a result of the discussion above, I rule that the Counterclaim is an abuse of process and the principle of issue estoppelapplies to the Newly Raised Issues.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Estoppel Applicable to Interlocutory Application   </b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> </b> There was argument whether the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> could be applied to a determination of a summary judgement application.

The only issue before the court was whether the defendantwas liable on the dishonoured cheque. The issue of the quality of the goods had not been considered by the court at all. The defendantwas thus not estopped from raising the issue of the quality of the goods in a subsequent action. The words used by Hunter JA at p.370A are ââ¦ the <i>basic</i> application of issue estoppel is to final judgements and not to interlocutory judgements, and therefore <i>it has to be applied to the judgements with very considerable care</i>â.

What is he to do? The second case may never be brought.Must he go to great trouble and expense to forestall a possible plea of issue estoppel if the second case is brought? This does notarise in cause of action estoppel: if the cause of action is important, he will incur the expense: if it is not, he will take thechance of winning on some other point. It seems to me that there is a room for a good deal more thought before we settle the limitsof issue estoppel. But I have no doubt that issue estoppel does exist in the law of England.

In the Draft Defenceand Counterclaim, the only clauses pleaded is Clauses 5(9)(a) to the Fourth Schedule and 3(c) of the Eighth Schedule of the TenancyAgreement, which relate to the deposit paid and are not relevant to the issue under consideration. With regard to Amended Defenceand Counterclaim, no express clause is pleaded.

In our case, no trade custom was suggested. Thus, the caveat at the end of thequoted paragraph from <i>Bowstead on Agency</i> does not apply. Furthermore, I could not find any clauses in all those documents that show that Henderson intended to contract personally.In fact Mr Lai agreed that there were no such clauses in the relevant documents. He submitted that the circumstances of the presentcase were such that Henderson had contracted personally. It is clear from the above quoted passage that I should only look at thedocument to see whether there exists an intention that the agent also contracts personally. Even if I were to look at all the circumstancesof the case, Mr Lai did not suggest what those circumstances were that would manifest such an intention.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> </b> In the absence of clauses or circumstances showing an intention that Henderson was to contract personally, it is clear that Shahdanwas the principal and Henderson was no more than an agent. To overcome this difficulty, Rich Life, I believe, introduced the ideaof Shahdan being the successor in title. I have dealt with this idea above.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> </b> Mr Wong suggested in his submission that Mr Lai had conceded at the hearing before Registrar Poon that Henderson signed as an agentof Shahdan and did not assume any liability.

Thatmust be right. The Amended Defence and Counterclaim is to a very large extent devoted to the circumstances relating to the makingof the representations. There is no express averment that the representations had been incorporated into any of the written agreementsbetween Rich Life, Shahdan and Henderson. Without such averment, the representations remain nothing more than representations. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> </b> Mr Wong also complained about two aspects of the alleged implied terms. The first complaint is that the factual basis upon whichthe terms were to be implied is not pleaded. To this end, I should refer to paragraph 18/12/16 of <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009</i> in which it is commented that â[w]here an implied contractual term is pleaded, particulars should be given of the material factsupon which the basis of which the implied term is said to arise.â The case Willy Fine Limited v Janyet Investments Limited (HCA4430/2001, 6<sup>th</sup> January 2003) is cited in support.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> </b> In Willy Fine Limited, there was an application for amendment to introduce a plea of implied term and a new cause of action in breachof the implied term.

The verycomprehensive description of the whole process of negotiations serves the purpose of giving the factual background against whichthe implied term arises. The absence of any averment stating whether the term is implied by business efficacy or operation of lawor otherwise is not fatal. Such an averment is an inference or a result to be drawn from the facts pleaded.

Any claim based on the implied term could not be sustained.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> </b> Mr Lai suggested that in determining whether the misrepresentations were inconsistent with the express terms, the court should considerall relevant contract clauses.

The âpre-conditionâ being referred to is contained in one of the paragraphs ofClause 19 of the Offer Letter which provides that: </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">ââ¦The formal license agreement should be signed at the same time and simultaneously with the formal Tenancy Agreement.

I do not see how the âpre-conditionâ could alter the clear terms of the Rider whichonly cover Shop D but not the kiosks.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> </b> Mr Lai argued that the court could only construe a document in the light of the circumstances surrounding its making when all relevantfacts are before the court. In the absence of all the relevant circumstances, as in the present case, the court should not embarkon the exercise of construing the documents. He cited Ng Chun Kong v First Star Development Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20HKLRD%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 HKLRD 281</a> in support. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> </b> The case Ng Chun Kong was an application under Order 14A or alternatively Order 18 rule 19. The issue to be determined was whetherthere was, by way of business efficacy, an implied term that the  retainer between the plaintiff and the defendant would not be terminatedby the defendant so as to deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity of earning its fees. The agreement in question was not formallydrawn up but consisted of four brief letters. Knowledge of the surrounding circumstances was thus necessary.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> </b> It is obvious that our case is not about whether there could be the implied term, or the precise ambit thereof, as pleaded in theAmended Defence and Counterclaim so that the court has to look at the surrounding circumstances in order to properly construe thedocuments to determine whether the implied term could arise. The issue in the present application is whether there could be the impliedterm as pleaded when it is contrary to the express terms. To that extent, Ng Chun Kong is not relevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> </b> In reply, Mr Lai argued that Rich Lifeâs case on contract was one of collateral contract. He submitted that the contract was firstbetween Henderson and Rich Life with Shahdan subsequently stepping in as a successor in title to Henderson. There being no pleason the considerations of this collateral contract, I have no idea how this could amount to a collateral contract and I really donot find any difference between this collateral contract and the contract as expressed in the Offer Letter. Anyhow, in terms of pleadings,a collateral contract is not different from any other contract. The parties, the considerations and the terms thereof must be pleaded.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Rescission based on Misrepresentation  </b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> </b> Besides contractual claim based on breach of any express or implied terms discussed above, there is one more aspect to the contractualclaim, namely, whether the claim for rescission based on misrepresentation is open to Rich Life. There are at least two conditionsto be satisfied before the claim for rescission against Henderson could be maintained. The first condition is that Henderson mustbe a party to the Offer Letter, the Tenancy Agreement and the Licence Agreement. I have already ruled that Henderson is not a partyto these contracts. It is sufficient to dispose of the claim for rescission against Henderson based on misrepresentation. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> </b> The second condition is that those representations were made. This is a question of fact. The general principle requires the courtto take the case of Rich Life to the highest. Mr Wong submitted that the principle of <i>res judicata</i> applied as a result of the judgements of Master Lo and HH Judge Chan. I accept this submission as discussed above.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> </b> The following factors, and the cumulative effects thereof, were put forward by Mr Wong in support of his contention that the Counterclaimshould be struck out on the ground of being vexatious and unsustainable: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the misrepresentations on which the Counterclaim was based were ruled by Master Lo and HH Judge Chan to be flatly contradictedby the express terms of the Offer Letter and the Licence Agreement; </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)  the reasoning and analysis of Master Lo and HH Judge Chan were unimpeachable; </p>            <p class="quote">(ii)  European style retail hub was provided as could be seen from the photographs;</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) since Rich Life was aware that the Licensed Area might be illegal structures, there was no reliance on the misrepresentations;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  there were different versions, which had been confirmed on oath, of the misrepresentations allegedly made by different personson different occasions;   </p>        <p class="quote">(d) the matters pleaded in the Counterclaim linking Henderson with the complaints of Rich Life were incomprehensible, incapable ofargument and without substance. In this regard, Mr Wong drew my attention to the following:  </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)  the allegation of âsuccessor in titleâ was incomprehensible and contradicted by documentary evidence which described Hendersonas âleasing agentâ;  </p>            <p class="quote">(ii)  the allegation that the Offer Letter was made by Henderson when the express terms of the Offer Letter provided that Shahdanwas the landlord; </p>            <p class="quote">(iii) the plea that the relationship between the parties were governed by the Offer Letter but not the Licence Agreement was withoutlegal or factual foundation, contrary to the express terms of the written agreements and contradicted by Mr Laiâs submission thatthe Offer Letter was a sham; </p>            <p class="quote">(iv) the implied term was contradicted by the express terms; </p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e)  after Shahdan had started the present action, a Mr Pang Man Ho, who was a director of Rich Life, allegedly published some defamatoryremarks to the effect that the Henderson Group was guilty of knowingly misleading Rich Life in relation to the licensing arrangements.Another action was commenced by Shahdan and Miramar Hotel &amp; Investment Company Limited against the said Mr Pang for defamation.One of the defences relied on by Mr Pang was justification. The particulars of justification, which were set out in the defence filedon behalf of Mr Pang, basically repeated the misrepresentations allegedly made by Ms Chung on which the Counterclaim was based. Inview of the inexplicable and incomprehensible pleas in the Counterclaim, Mr Wong invited the court to draw the inference the joiningof Henderson as a defendant in the present action was a litigation tactic used by Rich Life to support the defence of justificationadvanced by Mr Pang. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> </b> Sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) are matters considered under the heading of abuse of process. Based on my ruling concluded in relationthereto, these two sub-paragraphs fall within the category of âfrivolousâ which include cases which could not possibly succeed.In my view, the Counterclaim could be struck out on this basis.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> </b> As to sub-paragraph (a)(ii), I do not think I could draw any conclusion by simply looking at the photographs.

I could not conduct a mini trial on affirmation evidence. Therefore, I do not think I could strike outthe Counterclaim on this basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> </b> Sub-paragraph (d) is an attack on various pleas of the Counterclaim. However, assuming that all or some of them are to be struckout, I still have to take an overview of the pleading to see whether, without those struck out pleas, the Counterclaim should bestruck out. Even if all those pleas are not supported by any legal principles, it does not necessarily follow that the Counterclaimcould not possibly succeed or would become unarguable. A short answer to the submission relating to sub-paragraph (d) is that thissub-paragraph only deals with the contractual aspect of the Counterclaim. I agree that insofar as the claim of Rich Life in the Counterclaimis based on contract, the same should be struck out on this ground for the reasons discussed above. I do not, however, think thatthe tortious claim of Rich Life could be struck out on the basis of matters raised in sub-paragraph (d) alone.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> </b> Sub-paragraph (e) in essence invites the court to draw an adverse inference against Rich Life that the Counterclaim is not <i>bona fide</i> as it has an ulterior motive to serve, namely, to support the defence of Mr Pang in the other defamation action. I accept that thereis some force in this argument. But on the whole, I do not think it is plain and obvious that the Counterclaim could be struck outon this basis. The fact that a claim should be struck out on some grounds does not mean that it must have been brought <i>mala fide</i>. I could not draw that inference suggested by Mr Wong.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> </b> Finally, Mr Lai suggested that as a matter of practice, the right answers to the criticisms levelled against the Counterclaim shouldbe a request for further and better particulars but not a striking out application. I think the answer really depends on the circumstancesof the case. The starting point is that the applicant in a striking out application does not have the obligation to improve the pleadingsof the respondent by requesting further and better particulars if the pleadings are defective. If the pleas are actually not supportedby any legal principles, I see no reason why the applicant should not make an application to strike out the pleadings. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> </b> As a result of the above discussion, I have to dismiss the appeal of Rich Life.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> </b> The Orders I shall make are as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the Appeal of the Plaintiff by Counterclaim shall be dismissed;  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) there shall be a cost order nisi that costs of the appeal be to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by Counterclaim with certificate for counsel, to be taxed if not agreed; </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  the cost order shall become absolute in 14 days. </p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Raymond Tsui)<br />            Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Representation:</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr.Thomas Lai instructed by Messrs S.
