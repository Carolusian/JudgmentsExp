For the reasons given below I accede to DrillTecâs summons to set aside the order.  However,no criticism can be made of the granting of the <i>ex parte</i> order because, as will be seen, there was a lack of full and frank disclosure at the time of the application to the Master.  Hadthere been full and frank disclosure the Master would have ordered an <i>inter partes</i> hearing.  Of that there can be no doubt.</p>    <p class="heading"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Background</span></p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Lucas HK and DrillTec formed an oral joint venture in 2000 in connection with drilling works for cable crossings under the Ma Wanand Kap Shui Mun channels between the New Territories and Lantau Island.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The joint venture was terminated by a written agreement dated 8 June 2001.  This had become necessary because differences had arisenconcerning the operation of the joint venture.  This âJune agreementâ was made between DrillTec on the one hand and Lucas HKand its parent company (the Lucas Group), a third company named âLucas Drilling Ltdâ and a Lucas Director, Mr Allan Campbellon the other hand.  It made a number of important specific provisions namely :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The Preamble :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe parties are of different opinions as regards the conclusion and handling of a joint venture project in Hong Kong commissionedby Skanska International Civil Engineering AB.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Lucas owes amounts from this project and the so-called Watermains Project to DrillTec.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) Clause 1 :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.   All the verbal and written agreements on a joint venture for carrying out the order placed under the contract dated 08.09.2000by and between Lucas and Skanska International Civil Engineering AB â the so-called CLP Project â are rescinded herewith.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">       Thus the mutual rights and obligations under said joint venture â except the amounts owing to DrillTec by Lucas for the provisionof staff, drilling plant, equipment and other services â no longer exist.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) Clause 2 :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2.   The parties reach the following separate agreement on the future hiring of staff, drilling plant and equipment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">            Appendix 1 - General Conditions of Hire</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">            Appendix 2 - Special Conditions, DrillTec 260 to Rig</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">            Appendix 3 - Special Conditions, DrillTec 400 to Rig</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">       Appendices 1, 2 and 3 constitute an integral part of this Agreement.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) Clause 12 :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â12. The present Agreement shall be exclusively governed by German law.  In the event of any dispute whatsoever, Munich (Germany)shall be venue for both partiesâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Thus, on its face, clause 1 provides that the only rights and obligations which survive the joint venture are specific obligationsof Lucas to DrillTec.  I say âon its faceâ because the interpretation of this agreement, by virtue of clause 12, is a matterof German law.  It is worthy of note however that there are many references in the other clauses to this effect; clause 3 statesâLucas still owes amounts â¦â, clause 6 states âamounts â¦ shall be paid by Lucas â¦â and âif Lucas defaults in paymentâ¦â, clause 7 states âLucas undertakes to pay â¦â and âclause 11 states âthe â¦ agreement is subject to the conditionprecedent that the amount â¦ has been paid by Lucas â¦â.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Two weeks before this agreement, on 23 May 2001, the Lucas Group and DrillTec entered into two âHiring Agreementsâ governingthe provision of rigs and services which enabled the continuation of the works under a new regime.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> All this spawned a number of actions in three different jurisdictions.  The last of these is the writ which is the subject matterof this application.  It is dated 29 December 2004.  In it, Lucas HK claims damages for negligence, namely that materials or serviceswere supplied to them under the Hire Agreements in breach of a duty of care.  Damages for breach of contract are claimed in the alternative. A number of matters should be noted, as follows.  Lucas HK was not a named party to the Hiring Agreements.  Their writ claims theservices under those agreements were supplied negligently.  The breach of contract claimed is breach of the June agreement to whichthey were a party.  The June agreement in clause 2 states âthe parties (which includes Lucas HK) reach the following separate agreementon the future hiring of staff, drilling plant and equipmentâ.  It then refers to the General and Special Conditions of the HiringAgreements.  Finally, clauses 14.2 and 14.3 of the Hiring Agreements state :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â14.2 The place of jurisdiction for all disputes, including any dispute concerning the formation and validity of the contractualrelationship, and particularly claims arising from bills of exchange or cheques, shall be Munchen, Germany for both Parties.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">14.3 German law shall be solely applicable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus there are exclusive jurisdiction clauses in both the Hiring and the June agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The earlier litigation was as follows.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) In February 2002 DrillTec commenced proceedings in Australia against Mr Allan Campbell as personal guarantor under the June agreement. Lucas HK made a âsecond cross claimâ in this action.  For all intents and purpose this claim was in identical terms to the HongKong writ.  The New South Wales Supreme Court stayed the claim on the basis that they should be heard in Germany because of the Juneagreements exclusive jurisdiction clause. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(ii) In October 2001 DrillTec commenced proceedings against Lucas HK for payments due under the June agreement in the Munich DistrictCourt.  Lucas lost at first instance and on appeal.  A further appeal to the Federal Court is pending.  Lucas HKâs primary contentionwhich has been unsuccessful twice so far, is that as the exclusive jurisdiction clause is invalid against one of the four partiesto the June agreement, namely the individual party Mr Allan Campbell, it is therefore rendered invalid against all other partieswhich as a result renders the entire agreement invalid.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(iii) On 28 December 2004 Lucas HK commenced proceedings, which in substance are the same as the Hong Kong writ, in the DeggendorfDistrict Court in Germany.  The particulars are the same, the relief and damages claimed are virtually the same.  One week afterthe commencement of this claim Mr Anthony Francis Hill, a partner of Lucas HKâs solicitors in Hong Kong, swore his first affidavitin support of the application to be granted leave to serve the Hong Kong writ out of the jurisdiction <i>ex parte</i>.  Six weeks later the <i>ex parte</i> order was granted.  Mr Hill had sworn a second affidavit a week before the order was granted, namely on 27 January 2005.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The affidavits do not refer to the June agreement, the Australian proceedings, any of the German proceedings or the exclusive jurisdictionclauses in either the June or the Hiring agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In the summons before this court DrillTec applies to set aside the order for service out of the jurisdiction on four grounds.  Ifind that each of those grounds has been made out.  I say at the outset however that I am acutely conscious of the fact that the<i>forum conveniens</i> for this action is Hong Kong.  The contract was made in Hong Kong, many (but not all) of the witnesses are English speaking and basedin Hong Kong, most of the thousands of documents are in English.  If the only issue was â<i>forum conveniens</i>â, the practical solution would be to litigate in Hong Kong.  However, I am constrained from taking that course because of the cumulativeeffect of the plethora of good grounds not to do so advanced by DrillTec.  I will now deal with each of them briefly.</p>    <p class="heading">(A)    Material non-disclosure</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The principles are not in dispute.  Materiality is decided by the court not the deponent.  In this case the non-disclosure is notdisputed.  However, Lucas HK submits it was not material and if it was Mr Hill has filed affidavits explaining and apologising forthe omissions.  In short, Mr Hillâs explanation was that as Lucas HKâs claim was in tort the June agreement and the other proceedingswere irrelevant.  There was no intention to mislead the court.  He therefore plainly knew about the omitted facts and he chose notto disclose them on grounds of relevance.  This court accepts the apology but it is difficult to understand the thinking.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> It is difficult to understand how even the possible existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause could be regarded as immaterial. Here there were two, in both the June agreement and the Hiring Agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> It is difficult to understand how the existence of three other claims on the same subject matter, all of which had gone against LucasHK on the grounds of, <i>inter alia</i>, the validity and effect of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, could be regarded as immaterial.  It is simply not possible to arguethat the Master would have granted the <i>ex parte</i> order even if he had known about these matters.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The disclosure was neither full nor frank.  The explanation also falls short of being satisfactory.  The Hong Kong writ is not intort only.  It claims breach of contract as well.  The contract to which Lucas HK is a party is the June agreement.  That agreement,by clear implication, refers to the Hiring Agreements (clause 2).  Both have exclusive jurisdiction clauses.  In reality the particularsof negligence pleaded amount to no more than breaches of the implied terms pleaded in the contract.  Breach of contract is also pleadedin the prayer for relief.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> This is plainly not one of those âvery rareâ cases where a court could exercise its discretion to overlook a material non-disclosure.</p>    <p class="heading">(B)    Exclusive jurisdiction clauses</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> This and the next two grounds are those which DrillTec would have been relying on to oppose the granting of leave to serve out ofthe jurisdiction had there been full disclosure and had the Master ordered an <i>inter partes</i> hearing instead.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The validity of the clause in the June agreement is still a matter of dispute in the German proceedings.  In due course Lucas HKmay have an opportunity of arguing to the German Federal Court that both lower courts made a wrong decision.  What is not in disputeis that the applicable law when interpreting the clause is German law.  On any view, there will be a preliminary argument about thevalidity of the clause.  That the German courts are better suited to resolving that preliminary point is stating the obvious.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I also agree with DrillTec that <i>this</i> exclusive jurisdiction clause is not confined to contractual disputes.  Clause 12 clearly states âany dispute whatsoeverâ.  Theagreement became necessary because of âdifferences of opinionâ regarding âthe handling of the joint ventureâ.  It does notsay âany disputes arising out of the contractâ.  It does not say âany possible damage claims of the Lucas companies againstDrillTec based on the CLP project shall not be affected herebyâ.  It is worthy of note that Lucasâs director Mr Allan Campbellexpressed the following view in his affidavit dated October 2002 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe provision that the Settlement Agreement would be subject to German law and the place of the jurisdiction would be Munich wasincluded in all drafts of the agreement after 30 May 2001.  I was content to agree as I believed it is essential that any issue arisingunder the Settlement Agreement affecting either myself or the Lucas companies should all be dealt with together.  It was my understandingof the clause as contained in the Settlement Agreement that it would require any disputes affecting myself or the Lucas companiesto be determined in one place, i.e. Germany.  I would not have countenanced or agreed to a position that would allow any disputewith myself or any of the Lucas companies to be agitated in different jurisdictions as has now occurred. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In my judgment, where such a clause is clear on a plain reading it would be bold indeed to say that it nonetheless permitted litigationin contract in one jurisdiction but litigation in tort in another.  Several authorities have been referred to me which say that theeffect of a clause cannot be avoided by âframing an action in tortâ and the bringing it in a preferred jurisdiction (in particularLord Denningsâ judgment in <i>The Sindh</i> [1975] 1 LL at 373 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAccording to that law, the exclusive jurisdiction clause requires this dispute to be determined by the Commercial Tribunal of Marseilleor the Commercial Tribunal of Paris.  The <i>plaintiffs cannot avoid that clause by bringing an action in England and framing it in tort.</i>â <i>(emphasis added)</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> It is not necessary for me to make any finding as to the validity of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  I do however attach weightto its apparent clarity, to the fact that it has been adjudicated on in courts in Australia and Germany and that it has been thesubject of opposing expert opinion from German lawyers.  Mr Bertrand Prell for Lucas HK and Mr Christian Stempfle for DrillTec haveproduced five affidavits between them on the matter.  It is not possible to reject the formerâs opinion but I deem it appropriateto say in this judgment that I prefer the latterâs.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> To conclude on this issue, to override the exclusive jurisdiction clause there is a greater burden on the plaintiff than merely toshow that Hong Kong is the more convenient jurisdiction.  Plainly both parties were well aware of the location of the works and thelanguage of the documentation at the time they made their agreement.  Other factors naturally must have come into play at the negotiatingtime.  Factors such as the undesirability of inconsistent findings in international litigation and the undesirability of parallelactions in different countries and also, of course, cost factors.</p>    <p class="heading">(C)   Lis alibi pendens</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> As already referred, Lucas HK commenced proceedings in December 2004 in Germany.  It is submitted by Lucas HK that the primary reasonfor so doing was to avoid a time bar in Germany.  Also, it is submitted that there is no direct equivalent of the common law tortof negligence in Germany.  Thus, it is argued, the grounds for litigating in Hong Kong are reinforced.  Lucas HK have undertakento withdraw the German proceedings if they are allowed to sue DrillTec in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Because of this undertaking this issue has become the least important of DrillTecâs grounds of opposition.  It remains, however,a factor in DrillTecâs favour.  It would have been logical and prudent for Lucas HK to commence proceedings in Germany not solelybecause time, in German law, was running against them but also because they realized that their arguments in favour of litigatingin Hong Kong plainly faced an uphill struggle.  I consider Lucas HK to have been motivated as much by pragmatism as by an awarenessof the German statutes of limitation.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Moreover, the absence of an exact equivalent of ânegligenceâ in German law is a non point.  Firstly, it is not necessary forthe two causes of action to be identical for <i>lis alibi pendens</i> to arise.  Secondly, the particulars alleged are effectively the same; it matters not what the cause action is called.</p>    <p class="heading">(D)   Good arguable case?</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> A plaintiff seeking service out of the jurisdiction must show it has a good arguable case, in this case in tort.  Consideration ofthis particular issue is not, of itself, determinative of DrillTecâs opposition.  It is nonetheless a contributory considerationin its favour.  Showing that Lucas HK has an arguable case is not enough.  It must be a good arguable case.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> It is plain that the differences between the parties centre around the June agreement, a contractual document.  It is not for meto decide but it seems a good arguable case to say that clause 1 of that written contract brought to an end all Lucas HKâs claimsagainst DrillTec except in certain specified regards.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> One looks at the June agreement in vain to find any specific reference to the survival of a potential claim in negligence or breachof care with Lucas HK as a plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> For all the above reasons I make an order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 4 and 6 of the defendantâs summons dated 17 June 2005 savethat the words âon an indemnity basisâ are deleted from paragraph 6.  The costs order is made on a <i>nisi</i> basis.</p>    <p>                                                                             </p>    <p>                                                                                </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> (M.P.
