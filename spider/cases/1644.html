The plaintiff held 150,001 shares while Mr Covey held 2,850,009 shares.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The 1st defendant, a BVI company, was at the material time wholly-owned by the 2nd defendant (a holding company registered in theCayman Islands).  The 3rd defendant was found by Stone J at trial<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> to have been the controlling mind of the 1st and 2nd defendants, echoing the view of Deputy Judge Carlson in earlier proceedingsthat the 3rd defendant was the â<i>eminence gris</i> under whose influence the directors and executives of these two companies take their lead in the overall conduct â¦ of these companiesâaffairs.â  He was therefore found, in effect, to be a shadow director of the other defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  By a contract dated 14 February 2000, the 1st defendant acquired e2e shares from the plaintiff and Mr Covey which, together withnewly issued shares, gave it a 55% interest and therefore control.  It left the plaintiff with a 3.56% interest, represented by 120,001shares.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The partiesâ intention had been to secure a public listing for e2e on the NASDAQ exchange.  However, in case that did not occur,the plaintiff was to have a put option as a means of disposing of the balance of his shares to the 1st defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The present proceedings were brought by the plaintiff alleging that the 1st defendant is in breach of the agreement by failing orrefusing to honour the put option which the plaintiff had sought to exercise on 18 February 2003.  He alleges that the 2nd and 3rddefendants are liable for inducing that breach.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  At the trial, Stone J dismissed the action on the ground that the put option clause had been so drafted as to render it incapableof being exercised.  The problematical clauses provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Closing Date</u> shall mean 22 March 2000 or such later date as may be agreed between the Parties.</p>        <p>13.02  Subject to the Purchaserâs rights under Section 14, the Put Option may be exercisable by the Sellers with effect from thedate falling 2 years from the Closing Date (the âPut Option Vesting Dateâ) provided that</p>        <p>(a)   ...</p>        <p>(b)   the Warrant Certificate shall have been duly issued by the Company to the Purchaser in accordance with Section 14.04 prior tothe Put Option Vesting Date.â</p>        <p>14.04  <u>Date of Issue</u>.  The Revenue Warrants shall be issued in the form of the Warrant Certificate attached as Exhibit C which shall be executed as adeed by the Company and delivered to the Purchaser on the date falling 24 months from the Closing Date (the âIssue Dateâ) andshall be exercisable for a period of 12 months from the date of their issuance, provided that in the event of any public offeringof the Company or an (âAcceleration Eventâ) occurring before the Issue Date, the Purchaser shall be entitled at its sole discretion to receive Revenue Warrants in accordance with Section 14.01 above ...</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Stone J held that the words âfrom the date falling 2 years from the Closing Dateâ in clause 13.02 and the words âthe datefalling 24 months from the Closing Dateâ in clause 14.04 had exactly the same meaning so that the condition for exercising theput option laid down by clause 13.02(b) could never be met: the Warrant Certificate could never be issued âprior toâ the PutOption Vesting Date.  Stone J therefore found that there was no breach of the contract since the put option had not been validlyexercised and, it followed, that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not liable for inducing any breach.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Court of Appeal<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> reversed Stone J and gave judgment for the plaintiff against all three defendants in the sum of US$741,937 plus interest.  RogersVP held that it could never have been the partiesâ intention to draw up a contract containing a put option that could never beexercised. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Mr Edward Chan SC,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> makes the following criticisms of the Court of Appeal in support of the leave application, namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) that the Court of Appeal never explained how the difficulty of construction considered crucial by Stone J could be overcome andhad wrongly concluded that on Stone Jâs construction, the put option clause was nugatory since it was in fact capable of beingoperated in the circumstances caught by the proviso in clause 14.04;</p>        <p>(b) that the Court of Appeal failed to deal at all with the liability of the 2nd and 3rd defendants and had wrongly failed to recognizethat even if the 1st defendant was in breach, it did not follow that the elements of the tort of inducing a breach of contract hadbeen made out against those defendants, the constituents of those elements raising questions of great general or public importancefit for decision by the Court.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In our view, for the reasons which follow, the application for leave to appeal must be refused.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The 1st defendantâs application</b></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Chan SC rightly accepts that the peculiarities of the agreementâs drafting giving rise to the dispute as to its proper constructionare case-specific and raise no questions of the required general or public importance.  On that ground alone, we would refuse the1st defendant leave to appeal.  There is no basis for leave on the âor otherwiseâ basis.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  We would add that the result arrived at by the Court of Appeal is amply justifiable.  It was an essential term of the bargain thatthe plaintiff and Mr Covey should be able to put the balance of their shares to the purchasers if the company did not become publiclylisted.  A refusal of a put option would have been âthe ultimate deal breakerâ<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> according to the plaintiff (whose evidence on all material factual matters the Judge accepted<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>).  The option was obviously not intended to be nugatory and the contract contained an elaborate formula for working out the put optionprice.  Thus, as Lord Hoffmann stated in <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</i>:<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... if one would ... conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not requirejudges to attribute to parties an intention which they plainly could not have had.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In our view, the apparent conflict between the two clauses is readily resolvable.  The condition for exercising the put option laiddown by clause 13.02 is that the Warrant Certificate must have been âduly issued ... in accordance with Section 14.04 prior tothe Put Option Vesting Dateâ.  It therefore makes it clear that the act of âdulyâ issuing such a Certificate âin accordancewithâ that clause is something which can and does take place âprior toâ the Vesting Date.  In other words, it requires Section14.04 to be construed as providing for such a Certificate to be issued prior to the Vesting Date. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  While the relevant provisions may be interpreted, as they were by Stone J, as referring to identical periods, thus posing a problemfor a âpriorâ issue of the Warrant Certificate, the court is not bound to adopt such an interpretation.  As the learned authorsof <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> point out:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... âfromâ may be taken to be either inclusive or exclusive, although the general assumption is that the day of the date, actor event is to be excluded in the computation. The principle, however, is not an absolute one, and the wording of the contract orthe intention of the parties may indicate a contrary construction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The wording of clause 13.02 does, in our view, indicate an intention that the periods in the two clauses should be differently construed. To cite <i>Chitty</i> again:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf the words used in an agreement are susceptible of two meanings, one of which would validate ... the particular clause in theinstrument, and the other render it void, ineffective or meaningless, the former sense is to be adopted. ... Thus, if by a particularconstruction the agreement would be rendered ineffectual and the apparent object of the contract would be frustrated, but anotherconstruction, though in itself less appropriate looking to the words only, would produce a different effect, the latter interpretationis to be applied, if that is how the agreement would be understood by a reasonable man with a knowledge of the commercial purposeand background of the transaction.â<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In our view, the period of â2 years from the Closing Dateâ should be construed as exclusive of the Closing date itself (andtherefore ending on 22 March 2002, when the right to exercise the put option vests), whereas the period of â24 months from theClosing Dateâ in clause 14.04 should be construed as inclusive (and therefore ending on 21 March 2002, by which time the Companywas bound to issue the Warrant Certificate, being an event occurring prior to the Put Option Vesting Date).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The compelling conclusion is accordingly that the put option was validly exercised with effect from its vesting date, putting the1st defendant in breach of the contract by failing to honour it.  We do not consider the contrary reasonably arguable.  For thisadditional reason, we refuse the 1st defendant leave to appeal.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The leave application of the 2nd and 3rd defendants</b></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Since Stone J held that there was no breach of contract, he did not consider it possible to reach a final view on the liabilityof the 2nd and 3rd defendants for inducing a breach of contract.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> However, we do not agree with Mr Chan SCâs submission that the Judge did not proceed to make findings capable of establishing theirliability in the event that his construction of the contract was reversed on appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Thus, Stone J found that the 3rd defendant was the controlling mind and effectively a shadow director of the other two defendants;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> that on 20 November 2000, the 3rd defendant had told the plaintiff âthe terms of the [Agreement] would not be honoured unless MessrsCovey and Lam were willing to renegotiate that which Mr Yip considered a poor and âbadly negotiatedâ deal from the viewpointof [the 2nd defendant]â;<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>  that the plaintiffâs attempts to have the put option discussed at e2e board meetings were rejected or ignored in November andDecember 2002;<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and that the plaintiffâs attempt at exercising the put option met with no response.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Stone Jâs reached the following conclusions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...I entertain little doubt that relatively early in the game that Mr Yip indeed had come to the view that the Put Option in questionâ which under the Principal Agreement potentially had applied both to Mr Lam, the current plaintiff, and to Mr Covey, his formerpartner â represented too expensive a contractual commitment, and that Mr Yip firmly had set his face against any payout upon thisbasis for the e2e shares then residually held by Messrs Lam and Covey. On the available evidence it is tolerably clear that nothingoccurred in the operation of this CDC group absent Mr Yipâs imprimatur, and to hold otherwise in my view would be to fly in theface of the clear commercial reality.â<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>        <p class="quote">â...in so far as there had been a contractually operable Put Option consequent upon the issuance by Mr Lam of his Put Option Noticeâ which I have held that there was not â I have no doubt that Mr Yip would have made it his business to decide and/or influencewhether payment would be made for Mr Lamâs remaining shares upon the basis of the Put Option formula appearing within the PrincipalAgreement.â<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In our view, while expressed in somewhat oblique terms (no doubt because of his prior decision that there was no breach), the findingsmade by the Judge sustain liability on the part of both the 2nd and 3rd defendants once one concludes that there had indeed beena breach of the agreement by the 1st defendant.  There is no doubt that the 3rd defendant and through him, the 2nd defendant (whichwholly-owned the 1st defendant and of which the 3rd defendant was found effectively to be a shadow director), were fully aware ofthe terms of the agreement and that the plaintiff had served notice under clause 13.02 for the exercise of his put option.  The Judgeâsfindings justify the conclusion that the 3rd defendant and through him, the 2nd defendant, deliberately caused the 1st defendantto fail or refuse to honour its contractual commitment to purchase the plaintiffâs remaining shares pursuant to the put option. We do not consider the contrary to be reasonably arguable.  Mr Chan SCâs suggestion that these are questions requiring a re-trialis, happily, not to be accepted.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  We accordingly dismiss the application and make an order <i>nisi</i> that the applicants pay the costs of this application to the respondent.
