concerns the arrest of a ship, was dealt with in two parts. The first part had to do with the striking out ofthe writ and the setting aside of the warrant of arrest. We dealt with that part by the judgments which we delivered on February24 this year. The second part concerns the question of an inquiry as to damages for wrongful arrest. And that is what we are dealingwith now.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> What we say now should be read together with what we said in February.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In outline, what had happened was this.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff bank, to whom the defendant's ship the <em>Maule</em>, had been mortgaged by way of security for a loan to three companies including the defendant, arrested that ship.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Complaining that the writ disclosed no reasonable cause of action and that the arrest was therefore wrongful, the defendant tookout a notice of motion seeking the striking out of the writ and the setting aside of the warrant of arrest.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On September 28 last year, Barnett J struck out the writ and set aside the warrant of arrest. In February, we dismissed the plaintiff'sappeal against such striking out and setting aside. The plaintiff had, we held, no cause of action because, contrary to the plaintiff'sargument, the mortgage did not permit it to sell the ship without accelerating the loan: something which it was entitled to do buthad not done before issuing the writ.</p>    <p class="heading">Inquiry as to damages for wrongful arrest of the ship ordered</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> But striking out the writ and setting aside the warrant of arrest is not all that Barnett J did by his Order of September 28 lastyear. He also ordered an inquiry as to damages for wrongful arrest.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I will come in a moment to my note of what counsel agree as to how that came about. Before setting out that note, it is necessaryto mention this so that the note can be understood. Mr Clifford Smith appeared on his own before the judge and as Mr Robert RibeiroQC's junior before us for both parts of this appeal. Mr Andrew Allman-Brown appeared on his own before the judge and as Mr MichaelThomas QC's junior for the first part of this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> <em>That note reads:-</em></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. Following judgment, Mr Clifford Smith asked for an order for an inquiry into damages. The plaintiff's recollection is that MrClifford Smith mentioned the possibility of <em>mala fides</em>. The defendant's recollection is that Mr Clifford Smith mentioned the <em>Cathcart</em> and said that the case before the judge was not dissimilar.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. The judge asked Mr Allman-Brown what he had to say.</p>        <p class="quote">3. Mr Allman-Brown said that he wanted the whole Order stayed until 9:30 the following Friday because the plaintiff had a second writand wanted a second arrest under that writ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4. The parties have no clear recollection of what Mr Allman-Brown said, but he did not specifically address the issue of an inquiryas to damages, but it is clear that he was objecting to an order for such an inquiry being made.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">5. The whole incident took no more than three to four minutes."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Undoubtedly, the judge gave the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard on the question of whether there should be an inquiry as todamages. But the defendant's initiative after the judge had given his reasons for striking out the writ and discharging the warrantof arrest must have come as something of a surprise to the plaintiff, since the defendant's notice of motion merely sought such strikingout and discharge. It did not ask that the plaintiff be ordered to pay damages. Perhaps if the plaintiff's then counsel had thoughta bit more quickly on his feet, he would have offered arguments in opposition to an order for an inquiry as to damages there andthen or sought an adjournment. But the fact is that the plaintiff was somewhat taken by surprise. And surprise is by no means thesurest path to justice.</p>    <p class="heading">The question</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As I see it, we ought to ask ourselves the question whether ordering an inquiry as to damages was the only proper course open tothe judge. If it was, then the surprise would not have made any practical difference, and the appeal against the order for such aninquiry should be dismissed. But if ordering the same was not the only proper course open to the judge, then I think that the appealshould be allowed to the extent of setting aside the order for an inquiry as to damages and remitting the issue of whether thereshould be such an inquiry to the judge for him to decide the same after going into it fully.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> So was ordering an inquiry as to damages the only proper course open to the judge?</p>    <p class="heading">The test</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The test to be applied in deciding whether or not to order an inquiry as to damages for the wrongful arrest of a ship was statedin these terms by the Privy Council in <strong>the Evangelismos</strong> (1858)12 Moo. P.C. 352 at p.359:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... is there or is there not, reason to say, that the action was so unwarrantedly brought, or brought with so little colour, or solittle foundation, that it rather implies malice on the part of the Plaintiff, or that gross negligence which is equivalent to it?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Applying that test to the facts of the case before them, their Lordships were of the view that it was not a case for damages.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In <strong>the Cathcart</strong> (1867) L.R. 1A. &amp; E. 314, Dr Lushington provided his appreciation of why their Lordships were of that view in that case, saying(at p.333) that it was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... because the plaintiff had acted bona fide with probable cause, and without crassa negligentia, having had reason to suspect thatthe defendant's vessel was one which had run his own vessel down, and got away in the night."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> He took a different view of the case before him, concluding his judgment by continuing thus (on the same page):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The present case is different. The plaintiffs had full knowledge of the facts, and must be held to the legal effect of their ownengagements. If they had regarded the terms of those engagements, they would have known they had no right to arrest the vessel. Addto this, the arrest of the vessel by the plaintiffs was made on the eve of commencing a profitable voyage, and after a decision ofthe magistrate adverse to their claim, and the plaintiffs have attempted to support the proceeding by making charges of fraud againstthe defendant, which they have quite failed to prove. I think this is a case for damages. I therefore order the release of this vessel,and condemn the plaintiffs in costs and damages; the amount of damages to be estimated in the usual way, by the registrar and merchants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In <strong>the Strathnaver</strong> (1875)1 App. Cas. 58, the Privy Council was concerned with a shipowner's claim against the unsuccessful promoters of a salvage suit.The claim was for demurrage or damages for the detention of the ship under a warrant issued by the promoters. There was no bad faithor malicious negligence on the promoters' part. And the Privy Council held that no such claim can succeed in the absence of bad faithor malicious negligence. In so holding, their Lordships applied the principle which they had laid down in the <em>Evangelismos</em> (supra) summarizing (at p.67) their approach in that case thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Their Lordships came to the conclusion, though the case was certainly a very strong one, inasmuch as the wrong vessel had been seized,that in the absence of <em>mala fides</em> or malicious negligence, they ought not to give damages to the party arresting the vessel."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The analogy with malicious prosecution</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The analogy between the tort of malicious prosecution and claims such as the present is well-established. Indeed, the expression"the malicious arrest of a ship by means of Admiralty process" is used by the President in the <strong>Walter D. Wallet</strong> [1893] P.202 at p.205.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> There is therefore justification for the view expressed by Prof. D.C. Jackson in his book "Enforcement of Maritime Claims" (1985)at p.178 that it "seems that for damages to be awarded there must be some element in the arrester's conduct apart from enforcementof his claim".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Bearing in mind the analogy to which I have referred, I examine with interest the discussion in "Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort",14th ed. (1994) on the element of malice in the tort of malicious prosecution. At the bottom of p.579, the learned editor offersthe suggestion "that malice exists unless the predominant wish of the accuser is to vindicate the law".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Adapting that to the wrongful arrest of a ship, it could be said that malice exists unless the predominant wish of the plaintiffis the enforcement of his claim by a sincere use of the process of arrest. And that, I think, is what Prof. D.C. Jackson was drivingat.</p>    <p class="heading">Coming to this ...</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As I see it, it comes to this. If a plaintiff wrongfully arrested a ship which he knew he could not legitimately arrest, then hewould be acting in bad faith. And, short of that, if he wrongfully arrested a ship without applying his mind to whether that wasa legitimate course: proceeding in that cavalier fashion because he was bent on harming the shipowner or putting pressure on himto accede to a demand, then his conduct could, in my view, be described as malicious negligence. And in either case, damages forwrongful arrest would be a proper remedy to grant the shipowner against him.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It seems to me to be impossible to say that the only proper course open to the judge was to conclude that the plaintiff had actedin bad faith.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Can it be said, however, that the only proper course open to the judge was to conclude that the plaintiff had acted in the cavalierfashion which I have just described?</p>    <p class="heading">Legal advice</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In answering that question, we cannot assume that the plaintiff had not sought - and proceeded under - legal advice from a competentsource.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> While I would not be prepared to go so far as to say that such advice is invariably a good answer to a claim for damages for thewrongful arrest of a ship, it seems to me that such advice must be at least a relevant factor to be taken into account in favourof anyone facing such a claim.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In that connection, I note that in <strong>Glinski v. McIver</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%20AC%20726" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] A.C. 726</a>, a leading case on the tort of malicious prosecution, each member of the House of Lords expressly recognized the significance oflegal advice having been taken. Here, I have in mind what was said by: Viscount Simonds at pp.774-775; Lord Radcliffe at p.756; LordDenning at pp.758-759; and Lord Devlin at p.780. Lord Reid, we see from what Viscount Simonds said at the end of his speech at p.753,concurred in that speech.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> All things considered, I think that it would be going too far to say that the only proper course open to the judge was to concludethe plaintiff had arrested the ship in the cavalier fashion which I have identified as constituting malicious negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In my judgment, this part of the appeal should be allowed. I would allow it to set aside the order for an inquiry as to damages andto remit the issue of whether there should be such an inquiry to the judge for him to decide it afresh after going into it fully.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> As to the costs below - bearing in mind that the striking out of the writ and the setting aside of the warrant of arrest were upheldand that only three to four minutes were spent before the judge on the question of an inquiry as to damages - I would make an ordernisi that the order as to costs made below be left undisturbed. As to the costs of this appeal (by which I mean the whole of thisappeal comprising of what we dealt with in February and what we deal with now) I would - bearing in mind that the plaintiff has loston the striking out and the setting aside, that its success on the question of an inquiry as to damages is limited to having thequestion re-opened and that the judge's error was contributed to by the omissions of its counsel - order that it i.e. the plaintiffpay the defendant 75% of the defendant's costs of the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Litton, V.-P.:</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I agree with the judgment which has just been given.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Nazareth, V.-P.:</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I also agree that the appeal must be allowed and the issue whether there should be an inquiry as to damages remitted to the judgeto decide it afresh. Given that conclusion, I do not consider it necessary or indeed appropriate to shortly say more than the following.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The test to be applied in ordering an inquiry into damages for the wrongful arrest of a ship, it is not in dispute, is that propoundedby the Privy Council in <em>The Evangelismos</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281858%29%2012%20Moore%20PC%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1858) 12 Moore P.C. 352</a> at p 359:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Undoubtedly there may be cases in which there is either mala fides, or that crassa negligentia, which implies malice, which wouldjustify a Court of Admiralty giving damages, as in an action brought at Common law damages may be obtained. In the Court of Admiraltythe proceedings are, however, more convenient, because in the action in which the main question is disposed of, damages may be awarded.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The real question in this case, following the principles laid down with regard to actions of this description, comes to this: is thereor is there not, reason to say, that the action was so unwarrantably brought, or brought with so little colour, or so little foundation,that it rather implies malice on the part of the Plaintiff, or that gross negligence which is equivalent to it?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> That test was followed by the Privy Council in <em>The Strathnaver</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%201%20AC%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875) 1 AC 58</a> at 67, where it was referred in the following way:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Their Lordships came to the conclusion, though the case was certainly a very strong one, inasmuch as the wrong vessel had been seized,that in the absence of proof of mala fides or malicious negligence, they ought not to give damages against the parties arrestingthe ship. It appears to their Lordships that the general principles of law are correctly laid down in that judgment, and it is theirintention to adhere to them."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> There was in the present appeal, as I understood the position, no evidence or serious question of <em>mala fides</em> on the part of the appellant. The award of damages implicit in the direction for an inquiry as to damages could only be sustainedupon a finding of malicious negligence or, to use the language of the Admiralty cases, <em>crassa negligentia</em>, from which the law implies malice. What precisely those expressions mean and how they are to be applied to particular circumstancescan, I dare say, be matters of some difficulty. However that may be, they are embodied in the test that binds this Court but fortuitouslyin the present circumstances present no great difficulty. I therefore do not find it necessary to analyse or refine the test or themeaning of those expressions. I say that the test presents no great difficulty in this appeal because the submissions came to focusupon the question whether the appellant had sought and proceeded in accordance with competent legal advice in arresting the vessel.An answer in the affirmative, while not necessarily a defence to <em>mala fides</em>, would make difficult a finding that the appellant was guilty of malicious negligence; see the approach of the House of Lords in<strong>Glinski v McIver</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%20AC%20726" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] AC 726</a>, particularly that of Viscount Simonds at 745. Although that was a case of malicious prosecution, as my Lord has pointed out, theanalogy between such a tort and claims of the present sort is well established. But, before the judge, that question seems neitherto have been raised or addressed. Furthermore, it is plain that Mr Clifford Smith's oral application for an inquiry as to damages(which it is not disputed he was entitled to make) took counsel for the appellant by surprise.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I return then to the question whether there is or there is not, reason to say, that the action was so unwarrantably brought, or broughtwith so little colour or so little foundation, that it rather implies that gross negligence which is equivalent to malice. Clearlybefore us it cannot be answered; the matter should therefore go back to the judge to be answered.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> As to costs, I also agree with Bokhary JA.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The appeal is accordingly allowed, the defendant's application for an order for an inquiry as to damages is remitted to the judgeto be decided by him afresh, and there will be an <em>order nisi</em> that the defendant is to have 75% of its costs of the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(G.P.
