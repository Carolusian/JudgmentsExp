The background of that claim has been set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 of the judgment dated 13<sup>th</sup> September 2007 in that action.  Mr. Wong applied in that action to strike out the Plaintiffâs statement of claim and to dismissthe action.

The safeguards against impropriety are to be found in therules and procedure that control the litigant and not in tort.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">I see no reason why the above cannot be applied to this case.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant was acting for Mr. Wong in DCCJ 145/2006.  The applications argued on 27<sup>th</sup> August 2007 and 11<sup>th</sup> October 2007 were made against the Plaintiff.  The information and chronology were provided by the Defendant to the court in supportof the relevant application.  Those information and chronology were not provided for the benefit of the Plaintiff.  As such, no dutywas owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff has provided no authority in support of his proposition that a civil servant working in the Department of Justiceshould be subject to higher standard of justification and responsibility.  I cannot see any basis to impose a higher standard orduty on a government counsel than that of an ordinary lawyer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Therefore, even assuming without deciding that the Defendant did provide âuntruthful informationâ and âuntruthful chronologyâto the court at the hearings as alleged, the Plaintiff does not have any cause of action against the Defendant and this action isbound to fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As stated by Scott J. in <i>Business Computers International Ltd.</i>, the safeguards against any such impropriety should be in the rules and procedure of the court.  The Plaintiff was present at bothhearings and could have addressed the Court on any âuntruthful informationâ and âuntruthful chronologyâ provided by the Defendant/Mr.Wong.  As a last resort, the Plaintiff may consider appealing against those judgments.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  By commencing this action and dressing it up as a claim against Mr. Wongâs advocate, the Plaintiff is in effect mounting a collateralattack on the final decision in terms of the judgments dated 13<sup>th</sup> September 2007 and 12<sup>th</sup> November 2007 of a court of competent jurisdiction.  This is an abuse of the process of the court and should not be allowed: see<i>Hunter v.

I should add here that despite thePlaintiffâs elaboration at the hearing, I am not satisfied that there is any âuntruthfulnessâ in the information and chronologyprovided by the Defendant to the Court in DCCJ 145/2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I therefore order the Plaintiffâs statement of claim be struck out on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of actionand that it is an abuse of the process of the Court, and the Plaintiffâs action against the Defendant be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Postscript</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  At the hearing before me, the Plaintiff has repeatedly accused the senior government counsel representing the Defendant of misleadingthis court.
