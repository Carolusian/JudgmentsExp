In a space provided for the purpose the place of departure is stated to be HKG, which I understand means HongKong, and the destination is N.Y.C., which I understand means New York City. The "first carrier" is stated to be the defendant. Spaceis provided for subsequent destinations and subsequent carriers but were left blank. It is stated in the air waybill that the goodswere consigned to Irving Trust Co. of New York, and it was directed "also notify Outlander Group Ltd.", the second plaintiff. Thefirst plaintiff was named as "the shipper". In a space provided the terms of payment of freight, U.S.$3,048.50, are endorsed: "asarranged collect".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The goods, in 65 cartons, were collected from the premises of the first plaintiff by the defendant and forwarded by Pan AmericanAirways on a place which was chartered, but by whom I was never informed. There were local charges, including cartage, which werepaid by the first plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> An air waybill issued by Pan American World Airways Inc. and "executed" on the 15/2/71 was produced with respect to 1280 cartonsof varied goods. It was common case, at least between the plaintiffs and the defendant, that included in the 1280 cartons were the65 referred to in the air waybill issued by the defendant. The shipper named is Messrs. Jillene Inc., 12th floor, Mirador House,Kowloon, and the consignee, Messrs. Thayer International Inc. c/o Hecny Transportation (U.S.A.) Inc., Los Angeles International Airportwith a direction that the latter be notified at 5628, West Century Bouldvard, Los Angeles for the attention of a Mr. Chan.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In a space provided under the heading "Issuing Carriers Agent" there appears: HTL/HKG.ML." This I understand means the defendant.The air waybill stated Hong Kong to be the airport of departure and Los Angeles the destination. In this air waybill freight was"Prepaid as per charter rate arranged".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Another air waybill was produced, issued by Flying Tiger Line Inc., the third party to the proceedings, dated the 18th February 1971.The shipper is named as Hecny Transportation Inc. and the same company is named as the consignee. This air waybill is in respectof 497 Cartons of wearing apparel and the airport of origin is stated to be Los Angeles and the destination John F. Kennedy Airport,New York. There is an endorsement on it to the effect that the consignee is to be notified immediately. It was, again, common casethat the 65 cartons referred to in the air waybill issued by the defendant were included in the 497 cartons.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The goods duly arrived in New York and on the 18th February were checked in by the third party and a carrier's certificate was issuedby it to Messrs. Taub, Hummel &amp; Schnall Inc. brokers acting on behalf of the second plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the 24th February the goods were released by the third party to a van, or lorry, driver who produced documents to justify deliveryof the goods to him and who verified his identification by producing an identity card and a driving licence. He also submitted tobeing photographed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Everything he produced was a forgery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The goods in question were purchased from the first plaintiff by the second. The goods were sold F.O.B. and payment was by Letterof Credit drawn on the Irving Trust Co., the Consignee named in the defendant's air waybill. The first plaintiff has been paid forthe goods and the second plaintiff has repaid the Irving Trust Co., so, in fact, it is the second plaintiff which is really the injuredparty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> On the 17th October, 1972 the plaintiffs issued a writ of summons with a Statement of Claim endorsed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The Statement of Claim, which was, indeed, far from precise, pleaded that the defendant, a company carrying on the business of transportationby air, by an air waybill dated the 13th February, 1971 "issued by the defendant and executed by the 1st plaintiff" agreed to carryby air, on a freight collect basis, the 65 cartons to which I have earlier referred subject to the terms and conditions in the waybilland to the terms of the Warsaw Convention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The Statement of Claim pleaded that in the waybill the first plaintiff was the Consignor, Irving Trust Co. was the consignee andthe second plaintiff was "the Notify Party". It pleaded that "the 2nd plaintiff was at all material times and is the owner of thesaid goods". It went on to plead that the goods having been entrusted to the defendant on the 13th February, 1971, the defendant"in breach of its duties as carriers and of the contract contained in and/or evidenced by the said air waybill failed to deliverthem to the consignee or the second plaintiff". The plaintiff pleaded further or alternatively that the defendant through its servantsor agents, Flying Tiger Lines, failed to take reasonable care in the carriage of the goods by delivering them to an unauthorisedparty. The Statement of Claim pleaded further or alternatively that the defendant wrongfully converted the goods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The claim is then set out as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"And the 1st or 2nd plaintiff claims:-..... damages in the sum of $111,973.593".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">That sum is the price of the goods, stated to be US$16,528.20, and the cost of freight stated to be US$3,116.29, converted into HongKong dollars.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> A Defence which was delivered was amended at the hearing.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> As a considerable part of the Defence raised was abandoned at the hearing and by reason of my decision I propose only to refer thoseparts of the Defence which I deem to be relevant. Where are only three such points: (1) The defendant made no admission as to ownershipof the goods; (2) the defendant denied that either plaintiff was entitled to the relief claimed or any relief; and (3) that the defendantwould rely on the terms endorsed on the defendant's air waybill.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Endorsed on the Air Bill issued by the defendant were certain "Conditions of Contract".

It was amended by a Protocol signed at The Hague in 1955 and the amended Convention was made part of the lawof England by the Carriage of Air Act, 1961. On the 18th September, 1961 a further convention was signed at Guadalajara and giventhe force of law in England by the Carriage of Air (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1962. Power was given in each of the acts to HerMajesty to extend them to, among other places, Hong Kong. This was done by the Carriage by Air (Overseas Territories) Order, 1967(S.I. 1967 No. 809). That Order came into affect on the 1st June, 1967 and it revoked the Carriage by Air (Colonies, Protectoratesand Trust Territories) Order 1953.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As I shall frequently have to refer to "Articles" in the Schedules to the Orders in Council I shall, when referring to a part ofthe Order, refer to it as a "section" to avoid ambiguity.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Section 4 of the Order provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The provisions of Section 1(1) and (sections) ..... of the Act of 1961, (the Carriage by Air Act, 1961) subject to certainadaptations and modification, as set out in Schedule 1 to this Order are extended to the territories mentioned in Schedule 3 to thisOrder".

The United States although a signatory to the Warsaw Conventiondid not sign the Protocol of The Hague nor did it accede or ratify it and it is not, therefore, part of American domestic law. Byreason of the definition of "High Contracting Parties" in Article 40 A in The Hague Protocol an interesting academic exercise mightbe had in the application of those words in the context of what I have just quoted. In Article 40A a High Contracting Party is defined:"In Article 37, paragraph (2) and Article 40, paragraph (1), the expression High Contracting Party shall mean State. In all othercases, the expression High Contracting Party shall mean a State whose ratification or adherence to the Convention has become effectiveand whose denunciation thereof has not become effective". If this were taken literally, and particularly when one remembers the preambleto the Protocol: "Protocol to amend the Convention for the unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by AirWarsaw, 12 October, 1929", and that America had signed the Convention one might easily conclude that the United States was a HighContracting Party. A further study of the Protocol would, however, suggest that the word "Convention" is used sometimes to referto the Warsaw Convention and at other times to refer to that Convention as amended. However, the matter is, as I said earlier, academicbecause that usually ambiguous piece of drafting has not been reproduced in the Queen's Printer's Copy of the Act of 1961 nor inthe Order in Council.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The position in Hong Kong is governed by the Order in Council and, as in England under the Act, Her Majesty may by Order in Councilcertify who are the High Contracting Parties.

Mr. Dicks' contention was that as there were in fact two air carriers involved then, by virtueof Article 30(3) of Part I of the Schedule, the consignor had a right of action against the first carrier, the consignee had a rightof action against the last carrier and each against the carrier at the time the loss was incurred. He contended that the consignor,the first plaintiff, had no interest in the goods at the time of the loss therefore it had no right of action at all or at the bestonly for breach of contract where, if successful, damages would be nominal; and that the second plaintiff was not the consignee namedin the air waybill therefore it had no right of action against the defendant.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Later both Mr. Cheng and Mr. Dicks informed me that they believed their arguments had been based on a wrong interpretation of Schedule4 of the Order and that in the circumstances the relationship between the parties is governed by the provisions of the adapted andmodified Guadalajara Convention as set out in Part II of Schedule 4 of the Order. It was unfortunate that the case should have beenpleaded, and argued for some days on the basis of "successive carriers". Having regard to the evidence of the only witness, to whichI shall later refer, I agree with Counsel and I only refer to the matter to say that such would have been my decision had it beennecessary to rule on the matter, and to introduce arguments later relied on by Counsel.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In the adapted and modified Guadalajara Convention, to which I shall hereafter refer to as the Guadalajara Convention, two termsare defined: "contracting carrier" and "actual carrier".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> "Contracting Carrier" is defined in Article I of Part II of Schedule 4 as:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "(b) a person who as a principal makes an agreement for carriage governed by the Warsaw Convention (in this reference WarsawConvention means the amended Warsaw Convention as applied) with a ..... consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the .....consignor;"</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">and "Actual Carrier" as:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "(c) a person other than the contracting carrier, who, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, performs thewhole or part of the carriage contemplated in paragraph (b) but who is not with respect to such part a successive carrier withinthe meaning of the Warsaw Convention. Such authority is presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> There can be no doubt that the defendant falls within the definition of a contracting carrier; indeed it is conceded.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Article II of Part II provides:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the agreement referred to in Article I,paragraph (b), is governed by the Warsaw Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwiseprovided in the Guadalajara Convention as applied by this schedule, be subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, the formerfor the whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the latter solely for the carriage which he performs."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It will be seen from that article that, whereas under Article 30(3) of Part I a right of action by the consignor, lies only againstthe first carrier or the carrier at the time of the loss, and by the consignee against the last carrier or the carrier at the timeof the loss, the contracting carrier in a carriage by air subject to the Warsaw Convention is, by reason of the Guadalajara Convention,liable for the whole of the carriage.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Article 18 of Part I states:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of loss of ..... any cargo if the occurrence which caused the damageso sustained took place during the carriage by air."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">It was common case that the loss of the cargo in the instant case took place at a time and in circumstances that fell within the timecomprising carriage by air as defined. The effect, therefore, of the Guadalajara Convention coupled with Article 18 is, in this case,to impose a liability for the loss of the goods on the defendant throughout.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Plaintiffs right to sue.</p>        <p align="left">          (a) The second plaintiff.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> As the right of the plaintiffs or either of them to sue was a strongly argued issue I think the circumstances surrounding the shipment,if I may use that word in relation to conveyance of goods by air, might usefully firstly be considered.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Only one witness was called in the proceedings, a Mr. Lam who is employed by the first plaintiff as supervisor of the transport divisionand who has been in the first plaintiff's employment for 14 years. His evidence was to the effect that the first plaintiff sold thegoods in question to the second plaintiff. The price of the goods was US$16,528.20 F.O.B. He said that his employer's customers usuallynominate the carriers and this case was no exception; the second plaintiff stipulated that the goods were to be transported by thedefendant. He said the goods were collected at the first plaintiff's premises by the defendant and that "a procedural fee" of $15was paid and also $45 as cartage.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The witness was cross-examined at some length by Mr. Dicks as to the general position after he hands over goods for transport toa carrier nominated by a purchaser. In one answer he said that when he hands over the goods to the carrier he considers he has fulfilledhis obligation to the customer. In another he said that when he hands over the goods to a nominated carrier he washes his hands offthem. He said that in the instant case he did not bother to ascertain the flight number of the plane transporting the goods. As tothe freight, which according to the air waybill was to be collected (I presume from the consignee before the goods were handed over)by the carrier, he said he was unaware if it had ever been paid, but that his firm had not paid it.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I pause there for a moment to deal with the point argued by Mr. Dicks without objection at the time from Counsel for the plaintiffviz: in whom did the property in the goods vest at the time of the loss.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> I do not intend to dwell on the evidence and cross-examination of the only witness nor the argument of Counsel on this point. Itwas stated in the Statement of Claim that the second plaintiff was at all times the owner of the goods; it was established that thegoods were sold F.O.B.; it was the uncontradicted evidence of the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff that the goods were soldto the second plaintiff and that when they were handed over for transportation he washed his hands off them; it was established,though not precisely when, that the goods were paid for. (The existence of a Letter of Credit would suggest the first plaintiff wouldbe paid on presenting necessary documentation of transportation); and there was evidence that the second plaintiff had met its liabilityto the Bank by reason of the Letter of Credit. I have no hesitation in holding that at the time of the loss the property in the goodswas vested in the second plaintiff.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> It was Mr. Chang's contention in his closing address that by virtue of Article 18 of Part I of Schedule 4 and Article II of PartII there was a strict liability imposed on the defendant throughout the whole of the carriage contemplated in the air waybill signedby the first plaintiff and the defendant. He argued that the defendant should not be heard to say that the first plaintiff had noright of action because it had no interest in the goods as that had not been pleaded. However, he said, even if it had been pleadedthere was no substance in the point. He referred to Article VII of Part II of Schedule 4:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of theplaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately"</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">and relied on it to support his contention. He coupled with it. Article 14 of Part I of Schedule 4:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his ownname, whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interest of another, provided he carries out the obligations imposed bythe contract." (Article 14 is pleaded in the Statement of Claim: "..... the plaintiffs will rely in particular, on Article 14 ofthe Warsaw Convention.")</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> I think I might usefully deal with Article 14 at this point by considering the rights conferred on the consignor and consignee byArticles 12 and 13 respectively.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Article 12(1) confers on the consignor, subject to him carrying out all his obligations under the contract of carriage: the rightto dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of departure or destination; or by stopping it in the course of the journeyon any landing; or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person otherthan the consignee named in the air waybill; or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of departure. But Article 12(3) reads:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article13 ....."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Article 13 reads:</p>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">"(1)</td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">Except in the circumstances set out in the preceding Article, the consignee is entitled, on the arrival of the cargo at the placeof destination, to require the carrier to hand over to him the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the chargesdue and on complying with the conditions of carriage set out in the air waybill.</td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(2)</td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.</td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(3)</td>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote"><strong>...................................................................................................................................</strong>"</td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            </tr>        </table>        <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> In considering such rights as are conferred by Article 12 on the first plaintiff it is quite clear that they ceased to exist "atthe moment" the goods arrived at New York airport. Until that moment he could have exercised those rights and, for example, calledfor the delivery of the goods to a person other than the Bank, the consignee named in the air waybill, e.g., to the second plaintiff,but he did not do so therefore all his rights under the article ceased. However, Mr. Chang, as I understand him, argues that as Article14 gives the consignor the power to exercise rights in his own name "whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interestof another", and as the defendant is liable for the whole of the carriage and the plaintiff can elect whether to sue the contractingcarrier or the actual carrier or both the first plaintiff is entitled in this case to act in his own name in the interest of thesecond plaintiff and sue the defendant.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> I do not think Article 14 enables a consignor to act in the interest of another except in circumstances which arise out of him exercisinga right conferred by Article 12. Indeed, it is my opinion that Article 14 was introduced (inter alia) to enable a consignor who hadno property in lost or damaged cargo, and, consequently, no right to sue for its loss or damage, to recover under the Warsaw Conventionthe loss sustained for the benefit of the real sufferer who had acquired an interest from the consignor but who could not sue byreason of not being a party to the contract of carriage. Suppose, for the sake of argument a vendor of goods consigned them by airand while the goods were in transitu called for them to be delivered to a person other than the named consignee and the carrier failedto deliver them. If the property in the goods had already passed to that person the consignor, ordinarily, would have no right ofaction for their loss as he had no interest in them, and the person to whom they should have been delivered would have lacked privitywith the carrier. By reason of Article 14, however, the consignor could act in his own name on behalf of the person to whom deliverywas directed.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> Likewise in the case of a consignee who has transferred his interest in the goods. He is entitled in his own name to demand the goodsfrom the carrier on their arrival and to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage ifthere is a failure to deliver within the prescribed time.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> As to Article VII of Part II I do not think Mr. Chang can derive much support from it.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> It must be remembered that Parts I and II of Schedule 4 are supplementary to each other. The former applies to an international carriagewhere there is a single carrier, or successive carriers as defined by Article 1(3) of Part I, the latter deals with the case wherethere are not successive carriers as defined but there is a contracting carrier and an actual carrier or carriers. Where Part II,the Guadalajara Convention, applies Part I also applies mutatis mutandis. That embraces the rights conferred by Articles 12, 13 and14. Article 14 says who may enforce the rights conferred by Articles 12 or 13, the consignor or consignee. Article VII merely refersto the plaintiff using the word comprehensively to cover the consignor or the consignee, whichever of them has the right to sue.In other words, the Article adds nothing to support Mr. Chang's contention.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> It is of interest to note that so far as cargo is concerned the parties to whom the Warsaw Convention and the Guadalajara Convention,as adapted and applied by the Order, refer are "the consignor" and "the consignee" on the one hand and the "carrier" (single, successive,contracting or actual) on the other. That it is clearly recognised that there might be others interested in the goods is indicatedin Article 12, (where, for example, the goods may be ordered in transitu to be delivered to some one other than the consignee) andArticle 14 (where the consignor or the consignee is empowered to enforce rights in his name whether acting in his own interest orin the interest of others) nevertheless, throughout it is the "consignor" or the "consignee" who is always named as the person whohas the right to sue in the event of loss or damage.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> This reference to the right of a consigner or a consignee to sue perhaps reflects the position created by the early articles of PartI of Schedule 4. Article 5 entitles "every carrier" to require "every consignor" to hand over a waybill, and "every consignor" hasthe right to require "every carrier" to accept such a waybill. Article 6 provides that the waybill shall be in three original parts:the first marked "for the carrier" to be signed by "the consignor"; the second marked "for the consignee" to be signed by "the consignor"and "the carrier"; and the third to be signed by "the carrier" and handed by him when he accepts the goods to "the consignor".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Nowhere in those articles is there a reference to any other party. But, again, the possibility of other parties existing is recognisedby Article 15 which provides that Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor or the consignee witheach other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or the consignee. Those articlesclearly recognise the possibility of lost or damaged cargo being the property of a stranger to the contract of carriage.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> It is also of considerable interest, I think, to note that Article 15(3) provides: "Nothing in this schedule prevents the issue ofa negotiable waybill" which suggests that ordinarily it is not negotiable. This again, recognises the possibility of a stranger havingthe property in the damaged or lost cargo. The negotiability of a waybill, according to the 3rd edition The Law of the Air by LordMcNair 181/2 is in some doubt in England but in Hong Kong there does not seem to be any, having regard to the provision of Article15(3). But although in Hong Kong a waybill may be negotiable under that sub-article nothing has been added in the other articlessuch as "or those deriving title from" to "consignor" or "consignee" to suggest that assignees acquire any right to act. On the contraryarticles which recognise the possibility of interested parties other than the consignor or the consignee expressly refer to the rightsof the consignor or the consignee to act for them. But be that as it may the air waybill in this case is clearly endorsed "not negotiable"and it is one of the endorsed conditions that the goods will only be delivered to the consignee named on the face of the air waybillunless otherwise specifically provided in the contract.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> The carriage of the goods in this case is, as I have said governed by the provisions of the Carriage by Air Acts (Application ofProvisions) (Overseas Territories) Order 1967 and in my opinion that order enables a consignor or a consignee of goods to instituteproceedings for the recovery of loss sustained by them or by persons who have derived an interest in the goods from them; but itis the consigner or the consignee and they alone who are entitled to institute proceedings.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> For the view I have just expressed I find support from an American case, Pilgrim Apparel Inc. v.

Indeed Article 26 recognises the possibility of a person otherthan the consignee being entitled to delivery. It provides that receipt by "the person entitled to delivery" is prima facie evidenceof satisfactory delivery. The Article also provides that it is "the person entitled to delivery" who makes complaint.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> An acknowledgment of an interest e.g. the right to delivery of the goods, in a person who is neither the consignor nor the consigneedoes not give that person a right to sue.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> The second plaintiff is neither the consignor nor the consignee and has no right to sue.

The first is a matter of law and as such is not a matter which requires specifically to bepleaded: Is a consignor entitled under the Order in all circumstances to sue irrespective of his interest in the goods carried?</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> It is quite clear that in some circumstances he is. Article 12 of Part I of Schedule 4 expressly empowers the consignor to changethe destination or delivery of goods up to the time they reach the destination stipulated in the air waybill and Article 14 authoriseshim to enforce those rights in his own name even if he is acting in the interest of another. So, clearly, the Warsaw Convention asapplied to Hong Kong envisages proceedings by a consignor although he may have no interest in the goods which have been lost or damagedeven after they have reached the destination stipulated in the air waybill if he has, under Article 12, directed their delivery tosomeone other than the consignee. Article II of Part II provides that the contracting carrier shall be subject to the Warsaw Conventionfor whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, and Article VII provides that an action for damages may be brought at theoption of "the plaintiff" against the actual carrier or the contracting carrier. It follows then that the consignor may be "the plaintiff"and may sue the contracting carrier for any loss or damage to the goods by reason of the consignor having exercised a right vestedin him by Article 12.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> However, so far as the rights of the consignor arising under Article 12 are concerned they can only be exercised up to the time thatthose of the consignee arise. The question then arises: when the right of the consignee to delivery of the goods arises does theconsignor to all intents and purposes of the Warsaw Convention pass out of the picture and lose the right to act; or does the rightto act continue, even on behalf of one whose right to delivery of the goods arises by virtue of an act of the consignee?</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> To answer that question I think one might consider the common law position and the effect of the Warsaw Convention on it.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> So far as the transaction between the first and second plaintiff is concerned there can be no doubt about the position: The firstplaintiff had fulfilled all its obligations to the second plaintiff. Indeed, so far as the transaction was concerned the first plaintiffconsidered that apart from an obligation to pay the air freight if the consignee did not, it was finished with it when it handedover the goods to the defendant.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> The common law position was stated very clearly in the case of Dunlop v.

The expression 'special contract' as used in the authorities does notappear to have meant a contract with special or unusual terms in it. It appears rather to have been used to distinguish the ordinarytype of situation, where goods were delivered to a common carrier without anything being agreed as to the identity of the personfor whom they were being carried and who would pay for the carriage, and for the special type of situation, where there was an agreementthat the goods were being carried for the consignor and that the cost of the carriage would be paid for by him."</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p align="left"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> In all the cases which Brandon J. reviewed, some of which were again reviewed by Roskill L.J. on appeal, which held that the consignorwas entitled to sue, the consignor was liable for the payment of the freight. In the Albazero case the ship which was lost was ona five years charter to the plaintiffs, and it was during the currency of the charter, while the plaintiffs were still liable forthe charter fees, that it was lost. The plaintiffs were also the consignees of the goods named in the bill of lading, but in fulfillmentof an agreement with a third party the property in the goods had already passed to the third party at the time of the loss.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> In the Albazero case the basis for the principle that a consignor who no longer has the property in the goods lost or who is no longerentitled to possession of them may sue for substantial damages was categorically stated.

The evidence, however, was to the effect that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the consignee thatthe latter would pay for the carriage. Buller L.J. non-suited the plaintiff. Later, however, on a hearing to show cause why the non-suitshould not be set aside, Buller L.J. reversing his earlier decision said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "..... whatever might be the contract between the vendor and the vendee, the agreement for the carriage was between thecarrier and the vendor, the latter of whom was by law liable."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> In Joseph v.

To the plaintiffs, therefore, from whom the consideration moves, and to whom the promise is made, the defendant is liablefor the non-delivery of the goods. After such a bill of lading has been signed by his agent, he cannot say to the shippers they haveno interest in the goods, and are not damnified by his breach of contract. I think the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the valueof the goods, and they will hold the sum recovered as trustees for the real owner."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> Brandon J. sought to find in the decisions a basis for the principle and found it in the doctrine of estoppel. He said (921d) :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "I think it is clear that (the principle) is based in estoppel, which has the effect, as between the consignor and the carrier,of precluding the carrier from disputing that the consignor has a sufficient interest in the goods to maintain an action for substantialdamages for loss of or damage to them."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> This attractive basis of Brandon J. was not supported by Counsel for the plaintiff on the appeal nor did its attractions fascinatethe Court. Roskill L.J. at 35 rejected estoppel and put the basis thus:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "I think Dunlop v. Lambert and the cases referred to in the speech of Lord Cottenham L.C. justify the submission that thecrucial question every time the right to sue was in issue was not where the title or risk lay but between whom there was privityof contract. Only if there were privity of contract could the plaintiff sue. Questions of title and risk were relevant to determinequestions of privity but once when privity was established neither title nor risk was a condition precedent to a successful claimfor full damages if breach of contract and resultant loss and damage were proved."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> There is one other case to which I would like briefly to refer which was reviewed by Brandon J., and Roskill L.J.: Mead v.

Buckmaster consigned the flour to the plaintiff in Kent. He sent it by Great Eastern Railways to Brick Lane goods station inLondon and paid the freight up to that point. Great Eastern then forwarded the flour to Bricklayers Arms goods station which belongedto South Eastern Railway to forward it to the plaintiff in Kent, the carriage being paid by the plaintiff. The flour was contaminatedby tar and the plaintiff sued South Eastern Railway Co. The jury found for the plaintiff on the facts. On a motion for a non-suitthe defendant argued that as the contract for sale between the miller and the plaintiff was oral the property in the flour had notpassed to the plaintiff by reason of S.17 of the Statute of Frauds 1677. Bovill C.J. in his judgment said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "If the case depended on whether the property had passed to the consignee, a rule ought to be granted to have that pointdiscussed. But the point does not arise; for here, under the ciroumstances, there was a contract for carriage between the plaintiffand the South Eastern Railway Company ..... There was therefore evidence for the jury of a special contract between the plaintiffand the defendants for the carriage of the goods, and on that ground the verdict must be sustained."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> Thus, in the Albazero case privity between the parties, which was first mentioned by Lord Ellenborough in 1813, is categoricallystated by Roskill L.J. to be the basis of the principle that a party to a contract may recover substantial damages after propertyin the goods has passed. The other cases which were concerned with the point referred to "a special contract" or "special circumstances",but never expanded on the basis of the principle, but on analysis they were all really referring to matters which were evidence ofprivity between the carrier and the other party e.g. the payment of freight or insurance. Brandon J., e.g., in that part of his judgmentwhich I have cited (921 e) said that as regards the circumstances necessary to bring the principle into operation it is essentialthere be in existence a contract "between the consignor as principal" and the carrier for the carriage of the goods.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> In a very different case, Bayof Pneumatic Tyre Company v. Clipper Pneumatic Tyre Company  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281902%29%201%20Ch%20D%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1902) 1 Ch.

Is he a party to the contract either as principal or agent? I have already referredto the Statement of Claim as being far from precise. Nowhere in it is it expressed that there is a contract between the plaintiffsor either of them and the defendant. It refers to an Air Waybill issued by the defendant and "executed" by the first plaintiff. Itstates that in the Air Waybill the first plaintiff is named as the consignor, but adds that the goods consigned to the named consigneewere "at all material times" the property of the second plaintiff. It states the goods "were entrusted to the defendant for carriage"but is silent as to by whom they were entrusted or what was the capacity of him who entrusted them. It states that in breach of dutyas carriers and of the contract "contained in and/or evidenced by the said Air Waybill" the defendant failed to deliver the goodsto the consignee. There again the Statement of Claim is silent as to the parties to the contract and to whom the duty is owing, andis most ambiguous as to whether the air waybill is supposed to be a contract between the first plaintiff and the defendant or ismerely evidence of an already existing contract between unstated parties.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> Putting an interpretation on the pleadings most favourable to the plaintiff, do the facts disclose a privity of contract betweenthe first plaintiff and the defendant which would entitle that plaintiff to recover at common law substantial damages from the defendant,the property in the goods having passed to the second plaintiff as I have already held? The answer is a categorical no. Consideringthe evidence of the only witness called by the first plaintiff, that he handed over the goods to the defendant at the instance ofthe second plaintiff and washed his hands off them, I think no other conclusion can be arrived at. The delivery of the goods by thefirst plaintiff to the defendant seems to fit snugly into what Brandon J. said when dealing with "a special contract". Having saidsuch a contract does not mean one with special or unusual terms went on to say: p.921(e)</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          "It appears rather to have been used to distinguish the ordinary type of situation, where goods were delivered to a commoncarrier without anything being agreed as to the identity of the person for whom they were being carried and who would pay for thecarriage, and for the special type of situation, where there was an agreement that the goods were being carried for the consignorand that the cost of the carriage would be paid for by him."</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">The instant case is an example of a very ordinary situation where goods were given to a carrier for delivery to a named consignee,the freight to be paid for by someone other than the first plaintiff. In this case there do not exist circumstances which would evensuggest that the first plaintiff was acting as an agent for the second plaintiff to make a contract with the defendant. It merelydelivered the goods to the carrier stipulated by the second plaintiff and thereby put in train circumstances which gave rise to acontract between the carrier and another, be it Irving Trust Inc., the consignee or the second plaintiff. The first plaintiff wasnot a party to the contract; there was no privity of contract between it and the defendant. There was a contract, perhaps, betweenthe first plaintiff and the defendant to take the goods from the first plaintiff's factory or warehouse in consideration of whichthe first plaintiff paid cartage and some "local payment" but that contract was fulfilled when the goods were transported to America.I am aware that the first plaintiff guaranteed the payment of the air charges and advances but that does not make him a party tothe contract of carriage; it is a separate and distinot contract.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> In the circumstances I hold that at common law the first plaintiff was not privy to the contract for carriage and would not be entitledat common law to sue for and recover substantial or any damage.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> That is the common law position but it has been expressly altered, at least to some extent, by the Order in Council when it enactedArticle 14 of the Warsaw Convention. Was it, however, the intention of the Order to interfere with the common law to the extent thata consignor who had no interest in goods and was not privy to their contract of carriage could still sue for their loss or damageat a time when all the rights of the consignee as contemplated by the Warsaw Convention as amended and adapted and applied by theOrder had arisen?</p>        <p align="left">          (I am assuming for the purpose of this case that the party named in the air waybill as consignor may, by virtue of Article14 of the Warsaw Convention, sue even though he is not in fact a party to the contract of carriage.)</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> It must be remembered that it is not the Warsaw Convention as amended or otherwise that affects the position but the legislationwhich applies it. What has been the law and has stood the test of time and been the object of judicial decisions down the years willnot lightly be departed from. It is only when legislation expressly ordains such a departure, or an intention to depart can clearlybe implied from it that a Court will hold such a departure to exist. In the instant case, the first plaintiff would not be entitledat common law to recover damages for the loss of the goods. Therefore any right to sue that it might have can only arise by virtueof the Order in Council. In Article 14 of Part I of Schedule 4 it is expressly provided that a consignor may enforce rights whichhe might not be able to enforce at common law, but the right to do so is, equally, expressly limited by Article 12(3) to the timewhen the rights of the consignee arise. Nowhere in Part I or Part II of the schedule is it expressly stated or to be implied thatthe power of a consignor and a consignee to enforce rights for the benefit of a third party co-exist. Indeed the effect of Articles12, 13 and 14 is expressly to the contrary. The contracting carrier and the actual carrier may be jointly sued under Article VIIbut under the Article the action may be brought, at the option of "the plaintiff", not "plaintiffs".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> The intention of Articles 12, 13 and 14 is, I think, obvious: to provide for a single, clearly identifiable plaintiff. Article 12gives certain rights to the consignor in the exercise of which he can, pursuant to Article 14, institute proceedings in his own namewhether acting for himself or another. But Article 13 extinguishes those rights of the consignor, and, therefore, the right to sue,at the moment the goods arrive at their destination. I say this for three reasons: Firstly because sub-article (2) imposes a dutyon the carrier to notify the consignee as soon as the goods arrive: Secondly because sub-article (1) confers the right on the consigneeto require the carrier to deliver the goods to him; and thirdly because sub-article (3) provides that if the carrier admits the lossof the cargo "..... the consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage".</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> The right to sue either the contracting carrier, the actual carrier or both is to be found in Article VII of Part II of the Schedule.I do not think, however, that Mr. Cheng can derive any support from Article VII in that it provides that the contracting carrier,as he is liable throughout the contract, may be sued at the option of the "plaintiff". The use of the word "plaintiff" in the articlerather than "consignor" or "consignee" clearly means the person entitled to sue, and, by implication the one or the other who isentitled to sue, but not both. Had the Order in Council intended to change the common law it would have expressly so stated, or itwould be a necessary implication from its wording. It does not expressly do so nor is any implication to do so discernible.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> The position then as I see it is this: The intention of those States responsible for the Warsaw Convention and as amended at theHague and supplemented at Guadalajara was to limit the liability of carriers by air, and to facilitate the recovery of loss sustainedduring carriage by air. To this end they endeavoured to introduce rules which would simplify litigation and eliminate so far as possibleconflicts that might arise from local law. That could embrace such things as might arise from the doctrine of consideration in acontract, no longer so well loved by common-law lawyers as of yore and not recognised in many legal systems, or the doctrine of privityor interest of parties. In their endeavours to that end it was their intention that there would be only one possible plaintiff, theconsignor or the consignee, regardless of his interest or lack of interest in the goods. The right in the consignor to sue arosewhen the carriage by air as defined commenced and ceased when the right of the consignee came into existence. So long as his rightexisted the consignor could sue the first carrier or the carrier at the time of the loss under article 30(3) of Part I of schedule4 if there were successive carriers as defined by Article 1(3), or the contracting carrier or the actual carrier if Part II of theSchedule applied. The right to sue would remain in the consignor no matter where the goods were lost or damaged if he had taken thenecessary steps under Article 12 to retain it and had complied with the provisions of the Article. This right to sue would existdespite any common law inhibition. But once the rights of the consignee have arisen those of the consignor cease.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> As I said earlier it is only as a result of express provision in legislation or by necessary implication from it that Courts willdepart from the common law position and there is nothing in the Order in Council or the schedule to it expressly or by necessaryimplication altering the common law position and consequently I hold that the first plaintiff is not entitled to sue.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> As to Mr. Chang's argument that this is a matter that should have been pleaded I would say that the point is a matter of law andnot necessary to be pleaded. But I do not agree that the defendant has not raised the first plaintiff's right to sue. He certainlyhas not done so as he ought not do, simpliciter, but I think the pleadings do sufficiently raise the legal issue (the second aspectto which I earlier referred): the application of the Warsaw Convention; and in the Defence it is pleaded that in the premises neitherthe first plaintiff nor the second plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed nor any relief.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> Holding as I do that there was no privity of contract between the first plaintiff and the defendant, no consideration moved fromit to the defendant, and that the property in the goods lost was at all material times vested in the second plaintiff, the firstplaintiff has no right of action in contract against the defendant at common law; and that the Order in Council applying the WarsawConvention as amended, supplemented and adapted to Hong Kong has not in the circumstances of this case altered the common law position,I dismiss the claim of the first plaintiff as based on contract. In so far as the claim is based on tort, having found that the firstplaintiff had no interest in the goods nor was he entitled to possession of them after they arrived in New York, this too must fail.</p>        <p align="left"><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> The claims of both plaintiffs are dismissed with costs.</p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <p align="left"> </p>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>                <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(J.P.
