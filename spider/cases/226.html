In 1999 seven creditors of the plaintiff commenced an action in theHigh Court of Hong Kong (HCA 9505/1999) against the plaintiff.  On 6 April 2001 Waung J gave judgment to the creditors against theplaintiff in the sum of HK$254,480,424.88.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 23 August 2007 the creditors presented a winding up petition in Hong Kong against the company based on the unsatisfied judgmentin HCA 9505/1999. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 23 August 2007 Barma J in the winding up proceedings appointed provisional liquidators with power to commence actions in theplaintiffâs name to recover money belonging to or due to the plaintiff as they saw fit. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Pursuant to the order of Barma J, the provisional liquidators brought the present action against the defendants.  The action wasfunded by Dato Low, one of the creditors who recovered judgment in HCA 9505/1999. </p>    <p class="heading">Nature of the present claim</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  According to the statement of claim the plaintiffâs case against the defendants is as follows :</p>    <p class="quote">(1)  The defendants had been the plaintiffâs shareholders : the 1st defendant holding 80% of the shares; the 2nd defendant the remaining20%.  Prior to 23 August 2007 the defendants were also its directors.</p>    <p class="quote">(2)  On 5 February 1996 the defendants caused the plaintiff to enter into seven identical written contracts with the seven creditorsin HCA 9505/1999 (âthe vendorsâ) to purchase from them a total of 29,811,016 shares of Sun Cheong International Limited, a publiclylisted company in Hong Kong whose name was changed in 1997 to China Development Corporation Limited (âCDCâ).  Under the contractof sale the plaintiff was required to pay for the purchase of the shares from the seven vendors by instalments prior to the dateof completion on 2 May 1996 on which date the balance of the purchase price was to be paid and the share certificates and other documentsof title would be exchanged.</p>    <p class="quote">(3)  The defendants, however, were able to persuade the seven vendors to hand over to them the CDC share certificates before fullpayment by the plaintiff of the purchase price. </p>    <p class="quote">(4)   The CDC shares which were the only assets of the plaintiff were then charged or pledged by the defendants by way of agreements(âthe pledge agreementsâ) to the following financial institutions as security for loans made by these institutions to third parties:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1)   23 April 1996 to Commerzbank (South East Asia) Limited (âCommerzbankâ) of 12,032,302 shares (they became 60,161,510 sharesafter stock split);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2)   29 August 1997 to K G Investments Asia Limited (âKGLâ) of 48,822,700 shares;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3)   Late 1997, to Societe General Singapore Branch of about 28,000,000 shares;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4)   3 November 1997 to Creditanstalt Bankverein of about 10,702,625 new shares.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote">(5)  Between 1996 and 2000 these financial institutions exercised their rights under the pledge agreements with the plaintiff andsold the CDC shares in diminution of the indebtedness owed to them by third parties. </p>    <p class="quote">(6)  The seven vendors in HCA 9505/1999 sued and obtained judgment against the plaintiff for the unpaid price of the shares. </p>    <p class="quote">(7)  The plaintiff alleged that the defendants owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiff.  They had in breach of the fiduciary dutiesmisappropriated or recklessly endangered the CDC shares by pledging them.  They had also failed to ensure that the CDC share certificatesremained incumbent and in safe custody.  The breach caused the plaintiff loss when the CDC shares were eventually sold by the financialinstitutions.</p>    <p class="quote">(8)  The plaintiff claimed that the defendants are accountable to the plaintiff as constructive trustees for the loss incurred bythe plaintiff as a result of the defendantsâ breach of fiduciary duty and they are obliged to restore the plaintiff to the positionthat it would have been in had the defendant not committed their breach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p class="quote">(9)  As an alternative cause of action the plaintiff claimed that the defendants conspired together by engaging in an  unlawful anddishonest course of conduct in order to defraud the plaintiff (in particular, to defraud the plaintiffâs creditors at the timewhen the defendants knew that the plaintiff was either actually insolvent or likely to be insolvent) out of its only assets, namelythe partly paid CDC shares.</p>    <p class="quote">(10)  The plaintiff pleaded that prior to 23 August 2007 it was prevented by fraudulent concealment from discovering or taking actionsagainst the defendants in order to hold them accountable for their fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.  The factspleaded in support of the fraudulent concealment were :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1)the defendants together held 100% of the shares in the plaintiff;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2)prior to 23 August 2007, the management of the plaintiff was conducted by its board of directors, which comprised the defendants;and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3)the defendants would not cause or permit the plaintiff to take action against them on behalf of the plaintiff (including the creditorsof the plaintiff) so as to hold the defendants accountable for their breach of fiduciary duty, including the breach of trust whichthey caused the plaintiff to commit while acting as trustee in possession of the partly paid CDC shares.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote">(11)  The remedies sought by the plaintiff in this action are, among other things,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1)An order that the defendants account to the plaintiff for the value of the plaintiffâs property, which had been misappropriatedor recklessly endangered by them and thereby causing loss to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2)Alternatively, equitable damages or restitution to restore the plaintiff to the position it would have been in had the defendantsnot breached their fiduciary duties.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3)Alternatively, damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Service of the writ</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  I will address the issue of the service of the writ first, namely, in respect of the 1st defendant whether he was validly servedin Hong Kong and in respect of the 2nd defendant whether the conditions for service out of jurisdiction of the writ had been satisfied.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The first issue to decide is whether the 1st defendant was validly served in Hong Kong at the Airport. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 6 October 2007 the plaintiff received information that the 1st defendant was at the airport and a process server, Mr. Sze togetherwith his assistant were waiting there to serve the writ on him.  To ensure that the service was recorded, the assistant of Mr. Szerecorded the service with a video camera, although no sound was recorded of the conversation between Mr. Sze and the 1st defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The video of the service was viewed by the Judge who described the events as follows.  There was an exchange between the 1st defendantand Mr. Sze.  The 1st defendant was not prepared to stop.  Mr. Sze said something to 1st defendant and attempted to hand over a packageto him but the 1st defendant refused to accept it and proceeded to walk away.  The package that Mr. Sze attempted to hand over tothe 1st defendant consisted of the writ, the affirmation in support of the application for mareva injunction and service out of jurisdictionand the order granted by Beeson J.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr. Sze then placed the package on top of the 1st defendantâs small trolley suitcase which he was pulling along.  As the 1st defendantwalked away the package fell off his suitcase. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr. Sze said that he told the 1st defendant that he wanted to give him âCourt documentsâ.  The 1st defendant insisted that atno time had Mr. Sze said anything to him as to the nature or content of the documents.  The video clearly showed that something wassaid by Mr. Sze to the 1st defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Judge held that considering the purpose of Mr. Sze was to effect service of the court documents on the 1st defendant, it wasinherently probable that Mr. Sze did not inform the 1st defendant that he was being served with court documents.  He found that therewas proper service of the writ on the 1st defendant. </p>    <p class="heading">O<i>rder</i><i> 65</i><i>, rule 2</i></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  A writ is a document that requires to be personally served on a defendant.  Order 65, rule 2 of the <i>R</i><i>ules of</i> <i>High Court</i> provides that personal service of a document is effected by leaving a copy of the document with the person to be served. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In terms of personal service, the process server must hand the relevant document to the person upon whom he has to serve.  If thatperson will not accept the document, the only concession to practicality is for the server to tell him what the document containsand leave it with or near him : see <i>Kenneth Allison Ltd and others v. A. E. Limehouse and Co. (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20AC%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 AC 105</a> per Lord Goff of Chieveley. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In terms of âleavingâ, once the intended recipient (assuming him to have the required knowledge of its nature) has been givena sufficient degree of possession of the document to enable him to exercise dominion over it for any period of time however brief,the document has been left with him in the sense intended by the rule : see <i>Nottingham Building Society v. Peter Bennett and Co. (a firm)</i>, decision of the English Court of Appeal dated 14 February 1997 per Waite LJ. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Paragraph 65/2/3 of the <i>Hong Kong</i> <i>C</i><i>ivil Procedure 2009</i> also summarises how the personal service is to be effected :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â  Manner of effecting personal serviceâTo effect personal service the clerk or other person entrusted with the task should firstsatisfy himself that he has found the correct person.  He should then hand to or leave with the person to be served a copy of thewrit.  If the person served will not take the copy, he should tell him what it contains and leave it as nearly in his possessionor control as he can. </p>        <p class="quote">  If the defendant refuses to take the copy writ it is not necessary to leave it in his actual corporeal possession, but it is sufficientto inform him of its nature and throw it down in his presence (<i>per</i> Patteson J<i>.</i> in <i>Thomson v. Pheney</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281832%29%201%20Dowl%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1832) 1 Dowl. 441)</a>; yet this must be done under such circumstances as to bring the case within the above rule.  It is not sufficient to hand the defendantthe copy writ enclosed in an envelope without informing him that it is a copy writ (<i>Banque Russe v. Clark</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%20WN%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] W.N. 203).</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Although the 1st defendant refused to accept the writ, I agree with the Judge that what immediately followed constituted valid serviceof the writ on him.  I accept the Judgeâs finding that Mr. Sze had, in fact, informed the 1st defendant that the package he washanding over was court documents.  This is based on the inherent nature of the event.  In my view the writ was also left with the1st defendant. </p><br />    <p class="heading">What has to be said by the server</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The only substantive argument on this issue is whether Mr. Sze was required to inform the 1st defendant that the package consistedof a writ or whether it was sufficient for him to say that the package consisted of court documents.  While I accept that it wasnot difficult for Mr. Sze to inform the 1st defendant that the package consisted of a writ, my view is that it was sufficient forhim to inform the 1st defendant that the package consisted of court documents. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I agree with the view expressed by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in <i>Walters and others v. Whitelock</i> (decision dated 19 August 1994) that a practical approach must be adopted.  It is sufficient to bring to the attention to the personbeing served that it is a legal document which requires his attention.

The Judgefound that the KGL pledge was probably made in Hong Kong.  The statement of claim expressly pleaded that the KGL pledge was madein Hong Kong.  The KGL pledge agreement did not reveal the place of execution.  However, Ms Lau Wu Kwai King Lauren of the provisionalliquidators in her second affirmation stated the KGL pledge was likely executed by KGL and 1st defendant in Hong Kong having regardto the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 2.4According to the terms of the KGL Charge:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)KGL is a company incorporated in Hong Kong, with registered office at Asia Pacific Finance Tower, 27thFloor, Citibank Plaza, 3Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)The address for service of notices on KGL is also in Hong Kong, at the above address (Clause 6.2)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)At all material times, KGL also carried on business in Hong Kong, again at the above Hong Kong address.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>KGL</i><i> </i><i>Charge</i><i> </i><i>governed</i><i> </i><i>by Hong</i><i> </i><i>Kong</i><i> </i><i>law</i><i> </i><i>and</i><i> </i><i>Parties</i><i> </i><i>thereto</i><i> </i><i>submit</i><i> </i><i>to jurisdiction</i><i> </i><i>of Hong Kong Courts</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2.5 According to Clause 8 of the KGL Charge:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)The terms of the KGL share charge are governed by Hong Kong law; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)The parties thereto irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong and waive any objection to proceedings insuch courts on the ground of venue or on the ground that the proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On the other hand, the 1st defendant, in his second affirmation stated that the negotiations of the KGL pledge took place outsideHong Kong although he could not recall where the document was signed.  He maintained âthe actual agreement to charge (i.e. thepledge of CDC shares) was reached outside Hong Kong; everything else is merely a documentation of that factâ.  He further statedthat he was operating out of the Singapore at that time and the KGL executives he dealt with frequently travelled to Singapore atthe relevant times.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In my view in the absence of direct evidence from the 1st defendant that the KGL pledge was executed in Singapore, the Judge wasentitled to hold on the evidence that it was likely that the KGL pledge was executed in Hong Kong.  In any event the pledging ofthe KGL shares supported the plaintiffâs argument that the acts which formed the basis of liability were substantially and efficaciouslycommitted in Hong Kong irrespective of where the other pledges took place.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Likewise for paragraph (p), based on the above analysis I am satisfied that the defendantâs liability as constructive trusteesarose out of acts committed within the jurisdiction.</p>    <p class="heading">Good arguable case</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The plaintiff accordingly has shown a good arguable case that the situation is covered by paragraphs (f) and (p).</p>    <p class="heading">Merits of the plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p class="heading">The long delay</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The most striking feature in this case is the long delay by the plaintiff in bringing forward this claim.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The CDC shares were pledged between 1996 and 1997.  Two of the pledge agreements, namely those of Commerzbank and CreditanstaltBankverein were disclosed in the BVI Company Registry.  The forced sales took place between 1997 and 2000 and by 6 April 2001 judgmentwas obtained by the vendors against the plaintiff in respect of the shares.

On analysis, I have to say that the issue of limitation is a difficult matter and I am not preparedto say that the plaintiffâs case is bound to fail by reason of limitation if a striking out analogy is to be adopted.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The unique feature is that this action is funded by Dato Low who was one of the seven vendors who had recovered judgment againstthe plaintiff in 2001.  After the 2001 judgment he had received legal advice that as an unpaid judgment creditor he was entitledto wind up the plaintiff for the purpose of investigating how its affairs were conducted and allowing it to take further steps torecover its loss.  It was not challenged that the solicitor who gave him this advice was the same solicitor who acted for the creditorsin the winding up proceedings against the plaintiff upon which the provisional liquidators were appointed and he is also the solicitoracting on behalf of the plaintiff in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Added to this is that the 1st defendant was declared a bankrupt in Hawaii USA in 1998 and a trustee in bankruptcy was appointedover his assets although the 1st defendant remained a director of the plaintiff.  The 2nd defendant became a director in May 1996and apparently resigned as a director on 17 July 2000.  He served the notice of resignation on the plaintiffâs solicitors in HongKong.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In short the argument of the defendants was that the plaintiff actually knew or at least constructively knew (through the knowledgeof the creditors) of the pledging of the CDC shares in May 2000 (when Dato Low made his witness statement in HCA 9505/1999). Furtherthere was no concealment on the part of the defendants of the transactions which the plaintiff now relied upon as the basis of itsclaim against the defendants.  These transactions could with reasonable diligence have been discovered a long time ago.  The recentdecision of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Peconic Industrial Development Ltd v. Lau Kwok Fai and others</i> FACV No. 17 of 2008 which addressed the issue of discovery of misdeeds by reasonable diligence was relied upon.  </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  My view is that while the action is funded by Dato Low, the action remains an action of the plaintiff itself.  The question as towhat extent the knowledge of the creditors who funded the action can be attributed to the plaintiff is a difficult one which cannotbe resolved in the present application and in my view there is a serious question raised on this issue.  Likewise the question ofwhether the knowledge of the trustee in bankruptcy can be taken into account is also a serious issue to be tried.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In respect of matters specific to the 2nd defendant, three of the pledges were effected after he became a director.  His signaturealso appeared in the Commerzbank pledge.  There is thus also a serious question to be tried as to the 2nd defendantâs role in thetransactions complained of by the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Forum conveniens</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The only remaining issue on service is how the discretion should be exercised by reference to <i>f</i><i>orum conveniens</i>, namely, whether Hong Kong is the place where the case could suitably be tried for the interests of all the parties and for the endsof justice in accordance with the principles laid down in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460.</a> </p>    <p class="heading">The approach</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  When this topic is considered in the context of service out of jurisdiction under Order 11, it is important to bear in mind threematters which are distinct from an application to stay Hong Kong proceedings based on <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1)  The burden in Order 11 cases is on the plaintiff, whereas in cases in respect of stay of proceedings the burden is on the defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">2)  In Order 11 cases the plaintiff is seeking to persuade the Court to exercise its discretionary power to permit service on thedefendant outside the jurisdiction.  Order 11, rule 4(2) expressly provides that the Court will only do so if the case is âa properoneâ for service outside jurisdiction.</p>        <p class="quote">3)  The jurisdiction exercised under Order 11 may be âexorbitantâ in the sense that the jurisdiction is extraordinary in thatunder conflict of law rules, a Hong Kong Court will not recognize that a similar power is possessed by a foreign court over a HongKong litigant in the absence of some treaty providing for such recognition.  The effect is not merely that the burden of proof restson the plaintiff to persuade the Court that Hong Kong is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, but that he has to showthat this is clearly so<i>.</i>  In other words the burden is the opposite of that applicable where a stay is sought of proceedings started in Hong Kong as of right,see : <i>Spiliada</i> at 480-481 per Lord Goff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Real and substantial connection</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The issue is whether the plaintiff has raised a serious question that Hong Kong is not only the appropriate forum to try the casebut that this is <i>clearly so.</i>  The burden is on the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The âappropriateâ or ânaturalâ forum is one âwith which the action had the most real and substantial connectionâ.  Thisincludes not only factors affecting convenience and expense (such as availability of witness) but also other factors such as thelaw governing the relevant transaction and the place where the parties respectively reside and carried on business, <i>Spiliada</i> at page 478.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In my view, the âreal and substantial connectionâ requirement needs to be emphasised.  Modern commercial transactions usuallyentail multiple jurisdictional aspects.  Like the present case, they may involve, for example, the use of a company incorporatedin a foreign country with tax benefits; the acquisition or disposition of assets in different locations; employment of lawyers andaccountants in these locations to facilitate the transactions.  Inevitably a case may contain various jurisdictional aspects.  However,some of these aspects may feature only as the backdrop to the case.  They may have little, if any, substantial relevance to the issuesthat may be required to be canvassed at the trial.  Ultimately one has to consider the forum where the action could most suitablybe tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice.  Comments of a similar nature although differently puthave been made by the Courts in the past : the Court is not simply to load up factors which point to any particular jurisdictionbut to focus on the appropriateness of a forum from the point of view of the trial of the action, see : <i>Rambas Marketing Co. LLC v. Chow Kam Fai David</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKC%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKC 250</a> per Recorder Ma (now Ma CJHC) at 255.</p>    <p class="heading">Relevant factors</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In my view it is here that the plaintiff runs into difficulties.  The fact that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirement thatthe claim comes within the ambit of paragraphs (f) and (p) does not mean that one is precluded from examining the factors that hadbeen considered in the paragraphs (f) and (p) context to see if they point towards Hong Kong as clearly the appropriate forum forthe purpose of the exercise of discretion.  In some situations these factors may provide the conclusive answer but they are not necessarilyso in all cases. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Factors such as the Commerzbank pledge in Hong Kong, the CDC shares having been sold in Hong Kong and judgment having being obtainedin Hong Kong are relevant in so far as they show that there were acts done in Hong Kong and damage was sustained by the plaintiffin Hong Kong.  Where these acts are relied upon in the context of <i>forum conveniens</i>, one has to see whether they are indeed relevant considerations for the trial of the action.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The plaintiff is a BVI company which is not registered in Hong Kong.  It has not carried on any business in Hong Kong.  It did nothave any Hong Kong office.  For the purpose of this appeal, one proceeds on the assumption that the defendants controlled the plaintiffduring the relevant period.  The defendants are not residents of Hong Kong.  During the period when the alleged misdeeds were carriedout, they operated in Singapore.  Three of the four pledges were executed in Singapore.  Even if the KGL pledge was executed in HongKong, its place of execution for the purpose of the trial of the action could hardly be a significant factor.  CDC is, of course,a Hong Kong listed company and the pledged shares obviously had to be sold in the Hong Kong Exchange.  But again this factor is notof significance as the disposal was not challenged.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The issue at the trial is whether given the acts that had been done by the defendants, they had breached their fiduciary dutiestowards the plaintiff.  In relation to the 2nd defendant, a further issue is whether he had participated in the acts which causedthe plaintiff loss and damage.  The evidence that the plaintiff may rely upon in support of its claim would probably be based substantiallyupon the evidence that had been adduced in HCA 9505/1999.  In reality it would be the defendants who would have to give substantialevidence to defend their case.  One may ask why Hong Kong is clearly the appropriate forum to try the two foreign defendants whowill give substantial evidence in this case.  Even if Dato Low is to give evidence for the plaintiff on the question of concealment,one has to bear in mind that he is also not a Hong Kong resident.  He is an Indonesian who spends much of his time between Singaporeand Indonesia. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In my view the plaintiff has not really pointed to any factor of real and substantial connection to Hong Kong for the trial of thisaction.</p>    <p class="heading">Irrelevant considerations</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The Judge recognized the substantial connection of the dispute with Singapore but he referred to two proceedings in Hong Kong whichhe described as highly significant.  First he referred to HCA 9505/1999 in which the 1st defendant had taken part and provided awitness statement on behalf of the plaintiff.  However, in that case, Hong Kong was expressly provided to be the forum for the trialof action in the agreement for the sale of the CDC shares by the seven vendors.  The issue in that case was also different in thatthe vendors were suing the plaintiff for the unpaid balance price of the shares.  This is not as if the defendants themselves hadpreviously submitted to this jurisdiction.  Hence this action cannot be a relevant factor to be taken into account.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Second, the Judge took into account the appointment of the provisional liquidators by the Hong Kong Court.  The presence of provisionalliquidators would only become relevant if there is an asset within the jurisdiction in the form of a cause of action which is capableof being brought in Hong Kong.  This is precisely the issue that is being challenged in this case.  Hence the reliance on the appointmentof provisional liquidators is circular and does not answer the fundamental question whether Hong Kong is the appropriate forum forthe trial of this action in the first place.</p>    <p class="heading">Restraints in the exercise of discretion</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I am acutely aware that this Court is dealing with an exercise of discretion by the Judge.  As Lord Templeman observed at <i>Spiliada</i> at page 461 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The solution of disputes about the relative merits of trial in England and trial abroad is pre-eminently a matter for the trialjudge, before whom submissions should be measured in hours not days.  An appeal should be rare and the appellate court should beslow to interfere.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Further this Court is only entitled to interfere where</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  the judge has misdirected himself with regard to the principles in accordance with which his discretion had to be exercised;</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  the judge, in exercising his discretion, has taken into account matters which he ought not to have done or failed to take intoaccount matters which he ought to have done; or</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  his decision is plainly wrong,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>see <i>Louvet v.

Despite the persuasive argument of Mr. Fok, I do not consider that these two factors merely go towards weight and not relevance.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Hong Kong Courts no doubt have the expertise to deal with a case such as this and can adjudicate it with efficiency.  But this isnot the test to be applied in <i>forum conveniens</i> matters.  Based on the principles in <i>Spiliada</i>, my view is that the Judge had erred on this aspect of this case.  This entitles this Court to intervene.  In my view based on whatI have said the plaintiff has failed to show that Hong Kong is clearly the appropriate forum for the trial of this case against the2nd defendant.  This being the case the discretion was wrongly exercised to allow service out of the jurisdiction.  The order shouldbe set aside.</p>    <p class="heading">Existence of action against the 2nd defendant</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Mr. Fok further submitted that although he was not relying on paragraph (c) of Order 11, rule 1, namely, the 2nd defendant is anecessary or proper party to a claim that has been brought against the 1st defendant who had been properly served in Hong Kong, thisCourt should take this matter into account.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  This issue would only be relevant if the 1st defendant is unsuccessful in his application to stay the proceedings by reason of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  As will be apparent later, I also find for the 1st defendant on this issue, hence the matter will not advance the plaintiffâscase further.</p>    <p class="heading">Other matters</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Before the Judge there was argument that the plaintiff chose to sue the defendants in Hong Kong because of its concern that the2nd defendant is related to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and it may not be able to obtain a fair hearing against the 2nd defendantin Singapore.  This point is, of course, no longer pursued in this appeal and there is no need for me to address it.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Further although the issue of full and frank disclosure for the ex parte application before Beeson J had been raised it has notbeen pursued in this appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1st defendantâs stay application</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The burden is, of course, reversed in the 1st defendantâs application to stay the action against him based on <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  He bears the burden of showing that not only is Hong Kong not the natural or appropriate forum in the sense I have addressed butthere is another jurisdiction available which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the Hong Kong forum : <i>Spiliada</i> at page 477 and <i>Louvet</i> at page 674 to 675.  Many of the matters I have discussed earlier on connecting factors in relation to the 2nd defendant apply tothe 1st defendant as well.  In my view the 1st defendant has discharged the burden of showing that Hong Kong is not the appropriateforum. </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The 1st defendant relied on BVI or Singapore as the more appropriate forum.  In considering whether there is some other forum whichis the appropriate forum, one pertinent factor to consider is whether the plaintiff has founded jurisdiction as of right in HongKong : <i>Spiliada</i> at pages 476 to 477.  However, where the connection of the defendant with Hong Kong is a fragile one (for example if he is servedwith proceedings during a short visit to this country) it should be all the easier for him to prove that there is another more appropriateforum for the trial overseas : <i>Spiliada</i> at page 477.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The 1st defendant was sued by the plaintiff as of right in Hong Kong because he was served in Hong Kong.  However, this was donewhen he was at the Hong Kong Airport on his departure from Hong Kong.  The 1st defendantâs evidence is that he has never livedin Hong Kong and has never had any assets in Hong Kong.  There is no contrary evidence.  Mr. Fok argued that the reference to âfragileconnectionâ in <i>Spiliada</i> refers to a range of circumstances : at one end is a defendant who comes to Hong Kong for a holiday and at the other end is a defendantwho has business activities in Hong Kong.  I am prepared to take this into account but even based on the plaintiffâs evidence,there is no indication that after the delivery of judgment in HCA 9505/1999 in 2001, the 1st defendant had carried out business activitiesin Hong Kong which made his connection with Hong Kong a more substantial one.  Ultimately the 1st defendant is not a Hong Kong resident. I am of the view that he has also discharged the burden of showing Singapore to be the more appropriate forum to try this case bearingin mind the matters I have already referred to earlier.  He is entitled to set aside the present proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">Mareva injunction</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  As the 1st defendant succeeds in staying the action against him and the 2nd defendant succeeds in discharging the order for serviceout of jurisdiction, the mareva injunctions should be discharged.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Accordingly the appeal is allowed.  The action against the 1st defendant is stayed.  The order granting service of the writ outof jurisdiction against the 2nd defendant is set aside and the service of the writ on him is set aside.  The mareva injunction againstboth of the defendants is set aside.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The parties are required to lodge written submissions on costs within 14 days.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Yuen JA :</b></p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Burrell J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  I agree and have nothing to add.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Peter Cheung)</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Maria Yuen)</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(M P Burrell)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Joseph Fok, SC and Mr. Alexander Stock, instructed by Messrs Hwang &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr. Jose-Antonio Maurellet, instructed by Messrs Tanner De Witt, for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>        <p>Mr. Russell Coleman, SC, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>    <appeal>Appeal by the plaintiff to Court of Appeal dismissed.
