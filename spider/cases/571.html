The Defendant was a practisingsolicitor until 1995. He operated as a sole proprietor. His firm was predominantly engaged in conveyancing. The action arose outof an assignment dated 28 December 1990 executed by the Plaintiff and prepared by the Defendant. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendantfailed to exercise reasonable care and skill and allowed the Plaintiff to complete the purchase of a property without obtaining agood title. The Plaintiff discovered the defect when attempting to resell the property in 1997. The Plaintiff commenced proceedingsto have the title rectified and now seeks to recover damages against the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Mr Withington, who appears on behalf of the Defendant, agrees that to set aside a judgment which has been obtained regularly, theDefendant is required to show that he has grounds for defending the claim and that there was a real prospect of success. The Defendant'sdefence are that the Plaintiff's action has been statue-barred and secondly the Defendant was only instructed on a limited retainerto prepare the assignment and had no duty to investigate title.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Defence of limitation</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Mr Withington submits that under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>, the Plaintiff's action in contract or on tort cannot be brought more than six years after the date on which the cause ofaction accrued. Thus the claim in contract became time-barred in December 1996. In the case of the action in tort, this would havebeen six years from the date of completion. He submits that on whatever view, the claim was prima facie statue-barred in 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Mr Withington also refers to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, which provides for a special time limit for negligence actions where the facts relevant to the cause of action are not known atthe date of accrual, which in the present case is three years from the date of the Plaintiff having knowledge of the defect in title.Hence, he submits, if <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> applies, the Plaintiff's action became time-barred in April 2000. However, this section only applies to action for damages for negligenceand does not cover the Plaintiff's action in contract. In any event, this section is no answer to the Plaintiff's reliance on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)</a> for postponement of the limitation period. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26(6)</a> expressly provides that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 31</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a> shall not apply to any action to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)(b)</a> applies.

The requirement isthat the fact relevant to the cause of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant. But sub-s (2) amplifieswhat is meant by deliberate concealment and requires that for the purposes of sub-s (1) deliberate commission of a breach of duty,etc, amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach of duty. Generally speaking, and I do not say that theremay not be exceptions, the civil law and, so far as I know, the criminal law, does not require that a person should know the legalconsequences of the act which he commits. Generally speaking, if he knows of the act and he intends the act, but is unaware of thelegal consequences, his unawareness is immaterial for it is trite law that ignorance of the law is no defence. It appears to me thathad Parliament intended in the case of a deliberate concealment under s 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act, as amplified by sub-s (2), thatthere should be both deliberate commission of an act in the sense of knowingly and intentionally committing the act and also knowledgethat such commission gave rise to a particular legal consequence, then it required clearer words to spell that out than are to befound in sub-ss (2) or (1).</p>        <p class="quote">Accordingly, the conclusion I reach is that it is not necessary for the purpose of extending the limitation period pursuant to s 32(1)(b)to the 1980 Act to demonstrate that the fact relevant to the claimant's right of action has been deliberate concealed in any sensegreater than that the commission of the act was deliberate in the sense of being intentional and that that act or omission, as thecase may be, did involve a breach of duty whether or not the actor appreciated that legal consequence. Accordingly, for my part,I would not accept the extremely lucid and well argued submission made by Mr Clarlwood."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In <strong>Liverpool RC Archdiocese v. Goldberg</strong> [2001] 1 All ER182, Laddie J, as he then was, explained <strong>Brocklesby v. Armitage &amp; Guest</strong> at page 190 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"22. So, for the purpose of s 32 of the 1980 Act, concealment is to be treated as deliberate if it is the result of doing an intentionalact. What, then, is the impact of this decision on s 32(2) of the 1980 Act? It will be appreciated that the latter uses the word'deliberate' twice; 'deliberate commission of a breach of duty' and 'deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach ofduty'. There is no reason why the common word 'deliberate' should have different meanings in the two locations in the same subsection.If that had been the legislative intent it would have been made clear. It follows that 'deliberate commission of a breach of duty'should be read consistently with <em>Brocklesby's</em> case. Any intentional act which amounts to a breach of duty amounts to a deliberate commission of a breach of duty and triggers s32(2) of the 1980 Act. The fact that in the proposed amendment to the reply, the Archdiocese concedes that Mr Goldberg did not knowhe was committing a breach of duty does not, therefore, exclude operation of the section. Mr Goldberg's advice was given intentionally.On the assumption, which I have to make for the purpose of this application, namely that it amounted to a breach of duty, that breachwas committed deliberately within the meaning of the section.</p>        <p class="quote">23. That leaves Mr Simmonds' second and major argument, that s 32(2) of the 1980 Act still requires there to be concealment of factsrather than law. However on this issue, it appears to me that the language of the legislation is clear and does not support Mr Simmonds'submissions.</p>        <p class="quote">24. Section 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act prevents the limitation period from running if there has been an intentional action which hasresulted in any fact relevant to the cause of action being rendered invisible to the claimant. It seems to me that the purpose ofs 32(2) of that Act is to treat breaches of duty which are 'deliberate' (in the <em>Brocklesby</em> sense), in the same way. That is to say, it deems intentional commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered inthe same way as if it were a deliberate concealment of the facts which are necessary to maintain the action for breach of duty. Thuseven if all the facts are known to the claimant, the intentional commission of the breach of duty in circumstances where that breachis unlikely to be discovered, results in the creation of a legal fiction, namely that the facts are unknown.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">25. This conclusion is reinforced by considering the concepts of 'concealment' and 'discovery' in s 32 of the 1980 Act. It appearsto me that they are inextricably linked to each other. Consider first s 32(1)(b) of that Act. This provides that the limitation perioddoes not run if 'any fact ... has been ... concealed'. The period of suspension lasts until the claimant 'has discovered the ...concealment ... or could ... have discovered it'. So, commencement of the limitation period is postponed because something, namelya relevant fact, has been concealed. It continues to be postponed until that same thing, that is to say the relevant fact, has beenor could have been revealed. The same analysis applies to s 32(2) of the 1980 Act. It applies to the commission of a breach of duty'in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered'. The 'it' here must be a reference back to the breach of duty. It isthe breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered. It must also be the breach of duty which is concealed. Thus concealment ofthe breach of duty would result in postponement of the limitation period until the breach of duty is discovered. However, if Mr Simmondswere right, commencement of the limitation period would be postponed if the breach of duty were concealed, but limitation would startto run as soon as the facts were discovered. The factor justifying postponement of the limitation period would be unrelated to thefactor removing the postponement. In my view that would be illogical and is not what the section means. Furthermore, if Mr Simmonds'submission were right, there would be little purpose in s 32(2) of the 1980 Act. If the latter is only triggered if and to the extentthat facts are concealed, then it appears merely to duplicate, in less clear language, the effect of s 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> One can have little to add to these elucidating dicta with which I am in complete agreement. The English Act is identical to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)</a> and (3) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>. Subsection (1) sets out three situations: fraud, deliberate concealment and mistake. Subsection (3) (which is the equivalent ofsubsection (2) of section 32 of the English Act) defines the meaning of the words "deliberate concealment" to mean the deliberatecommission of a breach of duty in certain circumstances. Thus, what has to be deliberate or intentional is the commission of thebreach of duty and not the concealment. As for intention, a man is taken to intend what he does. If he knows of the act he is doing,he intends the act, irrespective of whether he is aware of the legal consequence of his act. A man must be taken to intend the naturalconsequence of his act. If the circumstances are such that the breach is unlikely to be discovered for some time, then the Plaintiffhas made out a case of postponement of the limitation period under section 26(1).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> There is no dispute about the fact of the breach of duty. The dispute is whether the Defendant is liable on a full retainer or notliable on a limited retainer. On the basis that the Defendant was instructed to handle the entire property transaction, his failureto detect the defect in title in the property must be a breach of duty and in the circumstances an intended breach of duty. The Plaintiffwas his lay client and was entitled to rely on the Defendant's skill and care in handling the transaction. It is unreasonable toexpect that he would conduct a critical or professional examination of all the documentation to satisfy himself of a good title.Hence, the defect would not be discovered until another solicitor next had the occasion to examine the documentation, for example,in a subsequent re-sale. This may take years. In the circumstances, the breach would unlikely be discovered for some time. Thus,in the words of subsection (3), the alleged breach would be an intended or deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstancesin which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time. Hence, the breach would amount to a deliberate concealment of the facts involvedin that breach of duty. On the basis of the Plaintiff's case, time did not start to run until the attempted resale in 1997. The Plaintiffhas until 2003 to bring his action. The defence of limitation is therefore not available to the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr Withington submits that the interpretation of section 26 is arguable. He refers to <strong>Cave v. Robinson Jarvis and Rolf</strong>, Case No. A2/2000/0465, in which Parker LJ expressed doubts if <strong>Brocklesby</strong> was correct. He said he was informed by his London office that leave to appeal to the House of Lords has been granted to the appellantin that case. However, <strong>Cave v. Robinson Jarvis and Rolf</strong> is another Court of Appeal decision affirming the principle in <strong>Brocklesby</strong>, and all the judges, including Parker LJ refused leave to appeal. I am satisfied as the law now stands, <strong>Brocklesby</strong> is correct and I am undeterred by the prospect of an appeal in <strong>Cave v. Robinson Jarvis and Rolf</strong> to the House of Lords. Even if the judgment were set aside and the case were to proceed to trial, the Defendant has no prospect ofsuccess with his defence of limitation with the law as it now stands.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Factual defence</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Defendant's defence is that he acted under a limited retainer to draft the assignment of the property and to witness its executionon behalf of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff says otherwise. If what the Defendant says is believed, he has a valid defence.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> For an application under Order 13 to set aside a judgment regularly obtained, a mere defence is not enough. There is a substantialonus on an applicant seeking to set aside a regular judgment. In <strong>L &amp; M Specialist Construction Ltd v.

Is this credible? Has he a real prospect of success?</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> This was a property transaction. The Defendant was a practising solicitor and sole proprietor of a firm predominantly engaged inconveyancing. He may have handled a lot of similar conveyancing and has difficulties in remembering a particular one. But a limitedretainer must be a very rare occurrence. Drafting an assignment and witnessing its execution only is not the usual business of asolicitor's firm. A solicitor would not normally accept such a limited retainer unless he knows the client personally or that theclient was referred to him by someone whom he knows well or there are special reasons. In a normal transaction, if a solicitor discoversa defect in title but his client insists to proceed, he would advise him to seek independent legal advice and have him sign an acknowledgementto that effect. He would also require his client to sign an indemnity so as to protect himself from allegations of professional negligence.I would expect a solicitor instructed to draft an assignment only would take similar steps to protect himself. He would at leastrequire an indemnity to be signed so that he would not be accused of negligence should defect in title be discovered. But the Defendantcould offer nothing in his affirmation except the bare assertion that he remembered he was given a limited retainer. He did not explainwhy of all the things he has forgotten that he could remember he was only asked to draft the assignment and witness its execution.He certainly did not know the Plaintiff, which otherwise could have been a plausible explanation for the limited retainer. He didnot explain why his firm would accept such limited retainer. Despite the unusual nature of the retainer, he did not explain why hewas unable to recall the circumstances regarding this transaction. He did not say, for example, that it was his firm's usual businessto accept limited retainers so that he was unable to recall the circumstances relating to this particular one. Though he has nowlost all his files, there must be some of these circumstances that he could remember because of the unusual nature of the transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On the contrary, the Plaintiff produced a memorial from the Land Office showing that the Defendant was responsible for the registrationof the assignment. This may not be conclusive that the Defendant was acting for the entire transaction. However, the Plaintiff wasable to produce a letter from the Defendant addressed to the vendor's solicitors saying that the Defendant had instructions to actfor the Plaintiff, requesting for all the relevant title deeds and documents and inquiring about the balance of the purchase priceand costs to be paid by the Plaintiff upon completion. This is consistent with acting on a full retainer in the property transaction.If he was only retained for drafting the assignment and witnessing its signature, there was no need to enquire about the balanceof the purchase price and costs to be paid by the Plaintiff. There was also no need to ask for all title deeds and documents if hewas not required to check title of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In my view, his affirmation is just perfunctory. It failed to explain precisely what the proposed defence will be so that I can beassisted in forming a value judgment as to whether I can be satisfied with any degree of conviction that what he says is credibleand that he has a real prospect of success in the proposed defence. I can only come to the view that his affirmation is so lackingin content as to be incredible. His allegation is no more than bare and casual assertion. I do not think he has a real prospect ofsuccess in his defence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> As the Defendant failed to show that he has a real prospect of success in his proposed defence, the Defendant's application is dismissedwith costs to the Plaintiff and with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Anthony To)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Benjamin Chain, instructed by Messrs Johnny K K Leung &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Withington of Messrs Barlow Lyde &amp; Gilbert, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2001/1008.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
