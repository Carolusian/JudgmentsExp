Although he had signed a Client Agreement and had also opened an account (No.3537-02) with Securities, he did not buy or sell shares.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="49"><p><a class="para" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> As a general rule, however, he was aware of the difference between Hang Seng Index <brs_term brs_term_id="53" brs_term_type="9">futures</brs_term> and shares, and he knew that <brs_term brs_term_id="54" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> and Securities were two different companies in the C.A. Pacific group of companies. From these facts and from certain informationgiven to him on 16 January 1998 (which will be referred to in paragraphs 7-8 and 36-7 below), it can be inferred that he knew thattrading in <brs_term brs_term_id="55" brs_term_type="9">futures</brs_term> and acquiring shares on the stock market would have to be done through different brokers.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="50"><p><a class="para" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> In mid-January 1998, the stock market in Hong Kong was in an extremely volatile state. On 16 January 1998 (Friday), Mr Yu was anxiousto acquire shares in Sino Land (0083) as the price of that share had dropped considerably.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="51"><p><a class="para" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> Mr Yu contacted a Mr Wan, a broker at <brs_term brs_term_id="56" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term>. He did not contact brokers at Securities because he had dealt with Mr Wan for a period of time trading in <brs_term brs_term_id="57" brs_term_type="9">futures</brs_term>, and he had never bought or sold shares through Securities before. He also says that he thought <brs_term brs_term_id="58" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> was &quot;connected&quot; with Securities, in that they were owned by the same people, and that Mr Wan was responsible for many &quot;departments&quot;in the C.A. Pacific group of companies.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="52"><p><a class="para" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> When Mr Yu told Mr Wan that he wanted to acquire shares however, Mr Wan told him that Securities was being investigated by the Securitiesand Futures Commission, and that &quot;it might be wound-up and no buying and selling could then be done&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="53"><p><a class="para" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> Mr Wan then suggested to Mr Yu that he should open an account with another stockbroker. He proposed Sun Hung Kai Securities (&quot;SHK&quot;),a well-established brokerage.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="54"><p><a class="para" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> However, as it would take more than a week after the opening of an account before trading could be done, that would have meant thatMr Yu could not immediately use SHK as his stockbroker.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="55"><p><a class="para" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> Mr Yu was eager to buy the Sino Land shares immediately because of the volatility of the stock market. He says he therefore <brs_term brs_term_id="21" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> Mr Wan to proceed to buy the shares for him but the shares were to be &quot;settled&quot; later at a new account at SHK. There wasno discussion between himself and Mr Wan as to how the shares were to be acquired or as to the identity of the stockbroker. He leftit all to Mr Wan.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="56"><p><a class="para" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> A few minutes afterwards, Mr Wan told him that the Sino Land shares had been acquired and asked him to deposit the necessary funds.Mr Yu deposited an amount of $350,000 into the bank account of <brs_term brs_term_id="59" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> the same day (16 January 1998).</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="57"><p><a class="para" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> Even though Mr Yu says he had <brs_term brs_term_id="23" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> Mr Wan that the shares were to be &quot;settled&quot; at a new account at SHK, and even though he says (in paragraph 2 of his <brs_term brs_term_id="22" brs_term_type="9">affirmation</brs_term> filed 18 July 2002) that he opened an account at SHK &quot;with a view to receiving the shares&quot;, Mr Yu did not in fact takeany steps to open a new account at SHK that day (Friday, 16 January) or the next two working days (Saturday, 17 January 1998 andMonday, 19 January 1998). Mr Yu was unable to explain why he did not open an account at SHK on those 3 working days, the accountat SHK apparently being opened only several months later.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="58"><p><a class="para" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> On <brs_term brs_term_id="2" brs_term_type="3">settlement day</brs_term> 20 January 1998, Mr Wan told Mr Yu that the Sino shares were being &quot;detained&quot; at Securities, which had a petition for itswinding-up presented against it the previous day.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="59"><p><a class="para" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> Mr Yu says that that was the first time he realized that the shares had been bought through Securities, with whom he says he neverintended to contract because he was aware that the C.A.

He was aware that the funds remained with <brs_term brs_term_id="62" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term>, and his position was that if the <brs_term brs_term_id="61" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term> would agree to transfer the shares to him, he would then instruct <brs_term brs_term_id="63" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> to transfer the funds in exchange.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="61"><p><a class="para" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> The<brs_term brs_term_id="3" brs_term_type="2"> liquidator</brs_term>s have not done so, because of questions caused by a shortfall in shares acquired by Securities for its clients. Securities had, inthe last few days before its collapse, transferred some shares (even shares belonging to <brs_term brs_term_id="64" brs_term_type="9">cash clients</brs_term>) to lenders of C.A.

However, which clients' shares were so transferred is unknown as the shares were unnumbered.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="62"><p><a class="para" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> In a series of <brs_term brs_term_id="68" brs_term_type="9">decisions</brs_term> since 1998, this court has determined that:-</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="63"><p>(i) shares acquired by Securities for its clients belonged beneficially to the clients, not to Securities, so that the clients canrecover shares as beneficiaries, and were not merely <brs_term brs_term_id="65" brs_term_type="9">unsecured creditors</brs_term> of Securities.

As noted above, Mr Yu was aware of the difference between index <brs_term brs_term_id="129" brs_term_type="9">futures</brs_term> and shares, and he knew that <brs_term brs_term_id="130" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> and Securities were two different companies, albeit within a group of companies. If Mr Yu had thought that <brs_term brs_term_id="131" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> could go on the market itself to acquire the shares, then Mr Wan's information (that Securities was being investigated and on winding-upwould not be able to buy or sell) would not have made any impact on Mr Yu and there would have been no need for discussion abouta new stockbroker.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="87"><p><a class="para" id="p37" name="p37">37.</a> It is clear therefore that Mr Yu knew that <brs_term brs_term_id="132" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> would have to instruct a stockbroker to acquire the Sino Land shares.

Since Mr Yu had an account with Securities, Mr Wan therefore put through a &quot;buy&quot; order to Securities, andthe shares were duly credited to Mr Yu's account with Securities. (There was no evidence that <brs_term brs_term_id="134" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> had any account with any <em>other</em> stockbrokers through which <brs_term brs_term_id="135" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> itself could acquire the shares, to hold them on Mr Yu's behalf. Indeed, according to the <brs_term brs_term_id="133" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term>, <brs_term brs_term_id="136" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> did not even have an account with Securities, even though they were within the same group).</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="91"><p><a class="para" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> If, on the other hand, instructions not to acquire the shares through Securities <em>had</em> been explicitly given by Mr Yu to Mr Wan, or it was otherwise sufficiently clear to Mr Wan that Mr Yu did not want to acquire theshares through Securities, then <brs_term brs_term_id="137" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> would have been in <brs_term brs_term_id="138" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of the authority that Mr Yu had given them when it put through the order to Securities.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="92"><p><a class="para" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> However when on 20 January 1998, Mr Yu found out that <brs_term brs_term_id="139" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term> had put through the order to Securities in <brs_term brs_term_id="142" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of his instructions, he did not seek to get his funds back from <brs_term brs_term_id="140" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term>. Instead he demanded the shares which had been acquired by Securities. In doing so, he ratified <brs_term brs_term_id="141" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term>' <brs_term brs_term_id="143" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of authority.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="93"><p><a class="para" id="p43" name="p43">43.</a> So analysed, Mr Yu did become (through his agent <brs_term brs_term_id="145" brs_term_type="9">Futures</brs_term>) a client of Securities in respect of the acquisition of the Sino Land shares. Although he intended to place the shares into a newaccount that he would open with SHK, the fact was that from 16 January 1998 (when the shares were acquired) until 19 January 1998(when the petition was presented against Securities), no account had been opened with SHK and no shares had been &quot;earmarked&quot;or set aside by Securities for that purpose. If the facts had been that certain shares had been &quot;earmarked&quot; by Securitiesfor transfer to SHK, then Securities would have been holding them as bare <brs_term brs_term_id="13" brs_term_type="3">custodian</brs_term> for Mr Yu pending transfer to SHK. However that was not the case. Securities had acquired the shares as his stockbroker and thusMr Yu's position is no different from that of other <brs_term brs_term_id="144" brs_term_type="9">cash clients</brs_term> of Securities.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="94"><p class="heading">Conclusion</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="95"><p><a class="para" id="p44" name="p44">44.</a> In the circumstances, the <brs_term brs_term_id="146" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term>' conduct cannot be faulted and Mr Yu's <brs_term brs_term_id="171" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term> dated 2 April 2002 as supplemented by the document dated 6 May 2002 must be dismissed.

The effect of an <brs_term brs_term_id="154" brs_term_type="9">order nisi</brs_term> is that unless an application has been made to vary it, it shall become absolute 14 days after this <brs_term brs_term_id="191" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> is <brs_term brs_term_id="17" brs_term_type="2">handed down</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="103"><p><a class="para" id="p50" name="p50">50.</a> As for the <brs_term brs_term_id="157" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term>' <brs_term brs_term_id="177" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term>, the arguments on paragraphs (1) and (2) of that summons overlapped with the arguments on Mr Yu's <brs_term brs_term_id="193" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term>, so that there would be relatively little in the way of extra costs. The <brs_term brs_term_id="158" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term> failed on paragraph (3) of the <brs_term brs_term_id="194" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term> but little time was used on this part of the summons. In view of that, and in view of the fact that Mr Yu did not incur any legalcosts, I would make an <brs_term brs_term_id="156" brs_term_type="9">order nisi</brs_term> that there be <brs_term brs_term_id="18" brs_term_type="2">no order as to costs</brs_term> of the <brs_term brs_term_id="159" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term>' <brs_term brs_term_id="195" brs_term_type="9">summons</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="104"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="105"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="106"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td></brs_paragraph>            <brs_paragraph id="107"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(MARIA YUEN)</td></brs_paragraph>        </tr>        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="108"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td></brs_paragraph>            <brs_paragraph id="109"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"><brs_term brs_term_id="181" brs_term_type="9">Justice of Appeal</brs_term></td></brs_paragraph>        </tr>        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="110"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td></brs_paragraph>            <brs_paragraph id="111"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Sitting as an additional Judge of the<br />            Court of First Instance)</td></brs_paragraph>        </tr>    </table>    <brs_paragraph id="112"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <brs_paragraph id="113"><p>Representation:</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="114"><p>Mr Yu Man, in person</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="115"><p>Mr Doron Karliner of Herbert Smith for the <brs_term brs_term_id="160" brs_term_type="9">liquidators</brs_term></p></brs_paragraph>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <brs_paragraph id="116"><p>Remarks:</p></brs_paragraph>    <appeal>        <brs_paragraph id="117"><p>Appeal by Applicant to Court of Appeal.
