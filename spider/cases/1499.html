KCC occupied the ground floor while APL occupiedthe first floor.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  KCC alleged that APL permitted water to leak from its premise to KCCâs premise, causing damage to its property.  The first allegedleakage happened on 24 September 2007, the second alleged incident occurred on 29 May 2008 while the third occurred on 7 September2008.  The three claims were considered together.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The learned adjudicator held that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the water causing damage to KCCâs property camefrom APLâs premise.  Accordingly he dismissed the claim in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> alleged leakage.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  For the second leakage, APL had admitted liability but there was a dispute regarding damages.  This issue was resolved in favourof KCC.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The third purported leakage occurred on 7 September 2008 and forms the subject matter of this intended appeal.  KCC alleged at around9 p.m. there was water dripping from the ceiling.  KCC then informed the management office, and Mr Lam of the management office wentup to the first floor.  Mr Lam inquired with one Ms Law (ç¾ç¾å¦®) about the water leakage. Ms Law purportedly replied that it wascaused by a customer busting a water pipe.  Ms Law assured Mr Lam that it had been fixed. Mr Lam met Ms Law at the reception areaand did not go inside the room.  KCC also relied on a report written by Mr Lam 2 days after the purported leakage.  The report isconsistent with Mr Lamâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  APL alleged that there was no water leakage on 7 September 2008.  Ms Law testified that Mr Lam came to the first floor and askedabout water leakage.  Ms Law said she did not know of any, and if there had been one she would have someone fix it.  She checkedthe rooms and found no signs of water leakage.  She also testified that when the customer in Room 1 had left, a cleaner went insideand found no leakage.  APL also relies on a bill that shows the customer in Room 1 left the premise at around 7 p.m.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  There was an alleged letter put in evidence, purportedly from Mr Lamâs superior that states that Mr Lam did not even enter thefirst floor and could not have talked to Ms Law.  This letter is plainly inconsistent with the versions put forward by KCC and APLand was not relied on by either.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The learned adjudicator accepted Mr Lamâs evidence that Ms Law admitted there was water leakage some time before 9 p.m., 7 September2008.  This finding cannot be challenged now.</p>    <p class="heading">Grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The grounds of appeal relied upon are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Failure to consider the alleged damage suffered by KCC was caused by the water leakage from the premise of APL;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Failure to consider the previous occasions of water leakage, where APL was held not liable; and</p>        <p class="quote">(3) The extensive damage in KCCâs premises could not have been caused by the small amount of water leaked from APLâs premise.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Section 28 of Chapter 338 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a> provides that the only permissible grounds for leave to appeal from the Small Claims Tribunal are on point of law.  In essence, APLcannot dispute the findings of fact by the learned adjudicator.  However it is accepted that drawing improper inference from thefacts may amount to an error of law.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I shall consider the <i>first</i> ground now. Ms Dora K. H. Chan, counsel for APL submitted that the learned adjudicator came to the wrong conclusion that the waterleaked from APLâs premise (if any) <i>caused</i> the damage in KCCâs premise.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Relying on the floor plans available, the learned adjudicator was satisfied that the water came from Room 1, which was close tothe damaged area (concourse) in KCCâs premise.  The water then caused damage to KCCâs property.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Ms Chan submitted that the adjudicator erroneously used the floor plans, which are of different sizes and scales, to come to theconclusion that Room 1 was close to the concourse in KCCâs premise.  This is however a finding of facts that cannot be appealedagainst.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Even if it can be said that the learned adjudicator made an error of law in using the floor plans, which I do not consider to beso, Ms Lawâs admission of water leakage is fatal to the case of APL in any event, so far as the issue of causation is concerned. The admission was given shortly after KCC complained of water leakage to the management office.  The closeness in time between thebusting of water pipe and KCCâs damage makes it more likely than not that the damage was caused by the water leaking from APLâspremise.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  I now turn to the <i>second</i> ground, and that is the relevance of the previous water leakage.  I cannot see how the previous water leakage can be relevant whenthe learned adjudicator could find all the elements of the tort of negligence in respect of the leakage on 7 September 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Regarding the final ground, Ms Chan submitted that as the report by Mr Lam shows, APL had immediately turned off the water tap. Therefore there could not be enough water to cause extensive damage to KCCâs premise.  Whether there was enough water to causeextensive damage is a finding of facts that I cannot interfere.  Accordingly I gave no consideration to this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  A further point was raised in Ms Chanâs written submission, that is the learned adjudicator mistakenly took APLâs agreementto quantum of damages for $50,000 as admission to causation.  However, I cannot find such a confusion of the Adjudicator.  APL agreedwith KCC that if APL was found to be liable, the quantum of damages would be $50,000.00 even though KCCâs claim was more than $100,000.00. It is not opened to Ms Chan to submit that she opined that some stains in the ceiling were old stains and therefore they could notbe caused by the dripping that evening.  Leaving aside the question of whether Ms Chan is sufficiently qualified for distinguishingâold stainsâ from ânew stainsâ, and âprevious damageâ as opposed to âdamage caused by the water leakage on 7 September2008â, there is a greater issue caused by the agreement between parties to limit the damages recoverable.  The parties had alreadyagreed that if APL was found to be liable for the damage, APL agreed that the quantum of damages would be $50,000.00.    As I havefound above, the learned adjudicator had clearly directed his mind to the issue of causation of damage sustained before reachinghis decision regarding damages based on the agreement between the parties.  He had clearly separated the issue of quantum from theissue of causation.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  APL put forward numerous matters and alleged the learned adjudicator should have considered them.  These matters are only relevantto the findings of facts.  As APL has not put forward any arguable point of law for appeal, I would dismiss its application for leaveto appeal.  There shall be no order as to costs.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(D Yam)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />High Court</td>        </tr>    </table><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mrs Dora K.
