I venture to suggest that it is now tolerably well understood.A useful statement was made by Buckley L.J. in <u>Belmont Finance Corporation v.

Vibart  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 Q.B. 234</a>, affirmed  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 Q.B. 528).</a> The statement of claim should describe who the several parties to the conspiracy are and their relationship with each other. It shouldallege the conspiracy between the defendants giving the best particulars it can of the dates when or dates between which the unlawfulconspiracy was entered into or continued, and the intent to injure (see "Right of action" above): there is no call for a generalplea of "acting wrongly and maliciously" (Sorrell v. Smith  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%20AC%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] A.C. 700</a>, at 714) nor is that sufficient. It should state precisely the objects and means of the alleged conspiracy to injure and the overtacts which are alleged to have been done by each of the alleged conspirators in pursuance of the conspiracy, and lastly, the injuryand damage occasioned to the plaintiff thereby."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The function and purpose of pleadings and Further and Better Particulars has been exhaustively canvassed by the Court of Appeal (ofwhich I was a member) in its judgment given in this action on 15th March 1993. In brief, it is to ensure that a party knows the caseit has to meet and will not be taken by surprise at trial. The issue is whether the bulky CSOC and voluminous particulars meet thiscriterion.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> WMI was part of the Wheelock Marden Group of Companies. Between 1979 and 1984, it purchased through subsidiaries a number of vesselsfrom a Danish shipyard. There was a complicated system of financing. In part, it was that finance was by way of loans provided bythe Plaintiff. Security for the loans was supplied, inter alia, by guarantees from a Danish export credit guarantee institution (EKR)and from WMI. It is the shortfall guarantees from WMI given in relation to two vessels, Sealock delivered in April 1983 and Annalockdelivered in March 1984, that are the foundation of this action. The loans not having been repaid, WMI defaulted on its guaranteesand went into liquidation in August 1985. The Plaintiff's complaints are essentially twofold. First, although WMI initially had thebacking of D1, that is to say, that the Plaintiff was dealing with the Wheelock Marden Group, by 1982, D1, the parent company, wasno longer prepared to support WMI. This change of heart and intention was not brought to the attention of the Plaintiff by the Defendants.Second, the Defendants failed to disclose the true financial position of WMI, namely, that it was in solvent by the time the loanswere drawn down and the guarantees given and, in particular, failed to disclose a cashflow projection which would have revealed WMI'sreal cashflow and liquidity problems.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Para. 2.6 of CSOC reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further, each loan was made by the Plaintiff following and in reliance on a series of misrepresentations, both express and implied,including misrepresentations by omission, made by and on behalf of the Defendants. Further and/or alternatively, the Defendants aidedand or counselled and/or procured the making of such misrepresentations. Further and/or alternatively, they conspired together tomake and procure the making of such misrepresentations. Full details of the Plaintiff's claims appear below."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> As Mr. Heslop for D1 said, on its own that plea is deficient. It is plain, however, that that paragraph is merely by way of introductionor, as Mr. Cullen for the Plaintiff put it, an umbrella. The CSOC goes on to plead the representations, and to give particulars ofWMI's insolvency, of the falsity of the representations and of knowledge. Paragraphs 10 and 11 then read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"10. Further and/or alternatively, given the true position of W.M.I. and the fact that none of the Defendants made the Plaintiff awareof the same despite their knowledge of the same, the Defendants, from at least February 1983, must have conspired and did conspiretogether to make the said misrepresentation and they are, thereby, each liable for the making of such misrepresentations.</p>        <p class="quote">11. To support the allegations in paragraphs 10 and 11 above the Plaintiff will rely on all the facts and matters pleaded above and,in particular, on the facts and matters set out in Paragraphs 4,5 and 6 above. Until after Discovery and/or Interrogatories hereinthe Plaintiff is unable to give further particulars."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The reference to paragraph 11 in paragraph 11 is an error resulting from consolidation and will be corrected. Mr. Heslop criticizedparagraph 10 as simply being "the wish father to the thought" and said it is deficient in material averments of ingredients of conspiracy.Paragraph 11, he said, does not cure the deficiency, the reference to earlier paragraphs being too referential and vague. Accordingly,Further and Better Particulars were sought of paragraph 2.6. Request 13 asked the Plaintiff, in relation to each Defendant, to identifyeach overt act relied on in support of the allegation that each Defendant conspired with his co-defendants. The answer was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Paragraph 2.6 contains the primary allegations of conspiracy against the Defendants which are subsequently sufficiently particularizedin the Statement of Claim. See, in particular, paragraphs 4, 10, 11, 14, 21 and 22 of the Statement of Claim.</p>        <p class="quote">Further particulars are given herein and in the Schedule of Insolvency."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Of that answer, the Court of Appeal said in its judgment at page 23:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Again the answer to this request is wholly unacceptable for similar reasons to those given in relation to Requests 11 and 12.

To Request 13,it replied:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The overt acts relied upon are:-</p>        <p class="quote">(1) The express misrepresentations were made</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(I) as alleged in Paragraph 4.1 of the C.S.O.C. and the particulars given thereunder by the Fifth Defendant and by representativesof the First Defendant and W.M.I. and the Wheelock Marden Group (see the answers to Requests 46 and 47 as to the latter);</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) as alleged in Paragraphs 13.5 and 14.1 of the C.S.O.C., and the particulars given thereunder, by the Fifth Defendant;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) They were so made to the knowledge of all the Defendants (see answer to Requests 57 and 163) and as to the representations byomission the representations were not corrected by any of the Defendants (see answers to Requests 54 and 160);</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) The Defendants (other than the First Defendant) as the members of the Board of Directors of W.M.I. and the First Defendant asthe General Manager of W.M.I. had the common purpose of obtaining the loans from the Plaintiff specified in Paragraph 2.3 of theC.S.O.C.;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4) The said misrepresentations were made with the intention of inducing the Plaintiff to make the relevant loan as alleged in Paragraphs4.4 and 14.5 of the C.S.O.C. and the Plaintiff in reliance on the said misrepresentations entered into the relevant loans as allegedin Paragraph 12.1 and 23."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Of that answer, Mr. Heslop complained that paragraph (1) relies on the misrepresentations themselves. He said that if there is anallegation of an agreement to make fraudulent misrepresentations, overt acts relied on to support the allegation of an agreementcannot be the misrepresentations themselves as they are the product of the conspiracy not overt acts. He described this, with myconnivance, I am afraid, as the "boot strap argument".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> As to paragraph (2), he said it simply shows knowledge of misrepresentations but, if the misrepresentations themselves are insufficient,knowledge is equally insufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Heslop argued that paragraph (3) does not disclose any intention or purpose to injure because there is nothing wrong in obtaininga loan. Paragraph (4), he said, is again a "boot strap" plea.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> A similar request, Request 114 (1)(2) was made in relation to paragraph 10 of CSOC. The Court of Appeal ordered that proper particularsshould be given. The answer supplied pursuant to that order simply referred back to the answer to Request 13.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The pleading in relation to the Annalock is a mirror image of the Sealock. By Request 244, the Defendants sought the same particulars.The answer given after the Court of Appeal had so ordered again referred to the answer to Request 13.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Heslop asked whether, by engrafting the latest answer to Request 13 onto the CSOC, the criticisms of the Court of Appeal in relationto the original Particulars and the omission of ingredients of a conspiracy have been met. In his submission, the answer is "no".He argued that properly pleaded, there should be allegations of a particular date and place at which the Defendants agreed to makefraudulent misrepresentations for the purpose of injuring the Plaintiff. Overt acts would be further discussions culminating in suchmisrepresentations.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> With some diffidence, I disagree. I say with diffidence because I am conscious of my peculiar position in having been a member ofthe Court of Appeal which directed considerable criticism at the Plaintiff. I am conscious that the Defendants might have the impressionthat I have, as it were, turned my coat. It is true that both parties agreed that I should hear this application, and because I wasto some degree conversant with the case the hearing may have been curtailed. I do not, however, feel comfortable. Before sittingdown to consider this judgment, I gave directions at the end of the hearing that, inter alia, I should deal with all further applicationsand inevitably the trial. I now wonder whether that is appropriate and would like to hear counsel on this when convenient. In themeantime, I strongly suggest that a judge who has sat in an appellate capacity should thereafter deal with the same case at firstinstance only in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> So I disagree with Mr. Heslop. I disagree in relation to the ingredients because the only one about which there might, at first sight,be any doubt is the intent to injure. Request 114(3), however, asked whether it is alleged that the Defendants conspired togetherwith intent to injure the Plaintiff. The answer was "yes". The Court of Appeal did not order further particulars to be given.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr. Cullen argued that intention to injure is to be inferred from the overt acts, that is, that they were aimed at a plaintiff andthat injury and loss were reasonably foreseeable. He relied on the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Lonrho v. Shell</u> (1982) A.C.173 which was quoted with approval in <u>Lonrho v. Fayed</u>. Lord Denning said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The intent to injure may not be the predominant motive. It may be mixed with other motives. In this context, when the agreement isto do an unlawful act, we do not get into the quagmire of mixed motives as Lord Simon L.C. described them in the Crofters case atp.445. It is sufficient if the conspiracy is aimed or directed at the plaintiff and it can reasonably be foreseen that it may injurehim and does in fact injure him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I think that misses the point. At trial, a plaintiff will no doubt rely on Lord Denning to establish his case. As a matter of pleading,however, it remains necessary to aver that there was an intent to injure.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> As to overt acts, there was extended argument because of differing uses of the term by the parties. In answer to Request 13, thePlaintiff provided details of overt acts in the accepted sense, i.e. acts carried out in furtherance of the combination and its purpose.Mr. Cullen conceded before the Court of Appeal that at least one overt act must be pleaded. He argued that this has now been done.In Request 13, however, the Defendants were using "overt acts" in the sense of facts and matters relied on to support the avermentthat the Defendants combined. Such particulars, as Mr. Heslop said, are missing. Provided, however, the Defendants know who are allegedto be parties, in this case all of them, and when the agreement was concluded, in this case by February 1983, I do not think it canbe said that they do not know the case against them. By definition, conspirators do not usually make public their combination. Itis only as events unfold that an injured party is able to deduce that two or more persons have ganged up on him. It is a matter ofinference or deduction that those persons combined before carrying out the overt acts of which in his pleading the injured partywill complain.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I do not see the failure to do more than assert who were the parties to a conspiracy, or to give more than an approximate date, constitutessome exception to the rule that fraud and conspiracy must be pleaded with the utmost clarity and particularity. I do not need torely on the somewhat dubious authority of Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Astrovlanis v. Linard</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20QB%20611" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2 Q.B. 611.</a> Nor do I derive any assistance from scuttling cases such as <u>The Dias</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20QB%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2 Q.B. 625.</a> What is plain is that, in the same way as it is now impermissible to plead scuttling without more, it is impermissible to plead conspiracywithout giving particulars of who are parties thereto and, at least approximately, when the combination was formed. The pleader mustthen go on to aver and particularize the other ingredients.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> In this case, I am satisfied that all the necessary ingredients of conspiracy have been pleaded and sufficiently particularized sothat the Defendants can be in no doubt of the case they have to meet. If the matter rested there, I would dismiss the application.The essence of the conspiracy, however, lies in the alleged misrepresentations which are under attack by the individual Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Paragraph 4.21 of the CSC reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The above representations, including the representations by omission, were made on behalf of the Second to Twelfth Defendants asDirectors of WMI, and on behalf of the First Defendant. Further or alternatively, the Defendants and each of them authorised theFifth Defendant to make such representations and/or ratified the same."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> That paragraph relates to the Sealock. Paragraph 14.3 is in the same terms in relation to the Annalock. The Plaintiff no longer reliesupon ratification. By Request 55, particulars were sought of facts and matters which the Plaintiff relies on in support of the allegationthat representations were made on their behalf. In answer, the Plaintiff said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This is a request for evidence. The capacities in which the Defendants are sued are clear from the Statement of Claim. For the avoidanceof doubt and in so far as is necessary, the Plaintiff will say that the First Defendant is vicariously liable and/or liable as principalfor the acts and omissions of the Fifth Defendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> By Request 56(1), particulars were sought of the overt acts and documents whereby each Defendant authorised D5 to make such representations.The Plaintiff answered:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Plaintiff's case is adequately pleaded. In any event, this is a request for evidence. Once Discovery is complete and/or Interrogatoriesare supplied the Plaintiff may serve further voluntary particulars."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The Court of Appeal ordered particulars to be given so that the Defendants should know precisely how the case is put. The Plaintiffthen further answered Request 55:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Fifth Defendant acted on behalf of the First Defendant in that the First Defendant is vicariously liable and/or liable as principalfor the acts and omissions of the Fifth Defendant falling within his authority as a director of the First Defendant. These are thebest particulars that can be given."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In answer to Request 56, the Plaintiff said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1)and(2) The Fifth Defendant was an employee and a director of the First Defendant. As such he was authorised to negotiate in relationto the loans, specified in Paragraph 2.3 of the C.S.O.C., on behalf of WMI and on behalf of the First Defendant. The Plaintiff relieson the participation throughout of the Fifth Defendant set out in Paragraphs 3.4-3.10 and 13.1-13.5 of the C.S.O.C. and to the letterfrom the First Defendant referred to in Paragraph 3.4(1),4.1.1(3) and 4.1.4 of the C.S.O.C. which was signed by the Fifth Defendant.If and so far as he was not so authorised each Defendant ratified the representations when it or he became aware of the representations(see answer to Requests 57 and 163) and failed to withdraw or correct the same. These are the best particulars that can be given."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> For the individual Defendants, Mr. Kotewall said that there are no particulars in relation to them. Either the Plaintiff is not sayingor is unable to say that the representations were made on behalf of any of them or authorized by them. The particulars furnishedin relation to other allied paragraphs in CSOC do not take matters further because, when necessary, they refer back to Requests 55and 56. Consequently, none of D5's acts can be attributed to the individual Defendants. The Plaintiff, therefore, has no case andmust be struck out. A similar argument applied to the Annalock.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Mr. Cullen made three points. First, that paragraph 2.6 of CSOC asserts express agency which the Plaintiff will try and prove. Unlessagency or authority is in writing, particulars can rarely if ever be given. Like conspiracy, the matter is secret and it is for evidenceto establish its existence. He said the Plaintiff is entitled to cross-examine the individual Defendants as to whether they expresslyauthorized D5 to act on their behalf in negotiations with the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Of course, the Plaintiff will be entitled to cross-examine the individual Defendants, if they ever go into the witness box. Whetherthey go into the witness box depends upon whether the particular cause of action itself should go to trial.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The question, it seems to me, is whether express agency can be inferred from the mass of particulars that has been given. In my viewit can not. The particulars certainly suggest that the individual Defendants knew or should have known D1's position as to supportof WMI, WMI's financial position and D5's negotiations with the Plaintiff. But that is a very long way from supporting a claim thatthey authorized D5 to make representations or omissions on their behalf. I do not think that the individual Defendants should beexpected to defend on this basis.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Second, Mr. Cullen argued that because of their guilty knowledge, concurrence and intent, liability has been brought home to themas parties without any question of agency arising. He accepted, however, that it is necessary to demonstrate active or intentionalparticipation, that mere knowledge is not enough.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In <u>Culzean Inventions Limited v. Midwestern Broom Company Limited and Others</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%203%20WWR%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 3 W.W.R. 11</a>, Grotsky J. said at page 40:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have also further considered Star Cabs Ltd. v.

These must be intentional participation with a view to the furtherance of the common designand purpose: vide 12 C.J. 544; also Sask. Farm &amp; Land Co. v.

The question was whether directors were liable for an ultra vires investment in shares of another company, an investmentwhich the Court found to be an honest misapplication of money. In dealing with one director, Lindley L.J. said at page 36:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have come to the conclusion from his own statement, that Mr. Block was so mixed up in this, and took so active a part in it, thathe is liable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The Court had, however, to deal with the investment in terms of fraud. At a meeting, one of the directors made an untrue statementto shareholders. At page 640 Kay L.J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The persons who are before us are persons who were present at that meeting, and it is sought to make them liable because they, beingpresent at that meeting, must be taken to have heard Mr. Balfour's statement, and therefore to have concurred in that statement,and thus to have joined in misleading the shareholders. I am not prepared to say that the evidence is sufficient. All the evidencewe have got is that they were at the meeting. I have no doubt that the directors at the time - all those directors, at any rate,who are sought to be charged - believed, as they say they believed, that this was a perfectly valid and proper transaction, and theyhad no ground whatever for concealing it, and in order to bind them by a false statement of this kind made by Mr. Balfour, speakingfor myself, I should require it to be proved very clearly that they thoroughly apprehended the falseness of the statement that wasmade, and concurred in it for the purpose of deceiving the shareholders who were present. I do not think the evidence comes up tothat. The mere fact that they were present at the meeting does not seem to me enough to enable the Court to treat them as havingcommitted a fraud for the purpose of concealing the actual facts from the shareholders in reference to this investment in the shares.Therefore, I think the learned Judge was quite right in treating them as absolved from liability for this investment by the lapseof time that has taken place."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> For the purpose of this application, I have to accept all the facts and matters alleged by the Plaintiff as being true. The factsand matters come to this. By virtue of their position as directors of WMI, except for D7, who was only a director of D1, the individualDefendants were aware, through board and other meetings, minutes and circulars, of the circumstances of WMI and of the negotiationsfor the purchase of the two vessels. I note Mr. Heslop's arguments that access to documents is one thing but whether they were receivedor understood is another, and that in relation to Sealock, at least, there was a very small window of time in which the combinationcould have been effected. At this stage, however, it must be open to argument that the directors of a public limited company, whichwas indisputably encountering some problems, did have knowledge of D1's change of attitude, of WMI's problems and of the state ofnegotiations, and did endorse the approach adopted by D5. The possibility that D5 and through him D1 were on some frolic of theirown is a matter which very plainly ought to be investigated at trial. Complex and difficult though this cause of action is, I donot think it should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> I do not need to deal in detail with Mr. Cullen's third point, namely that in paragraph 100 of their defence the individual Defendantsmake an assertion of agency on the part of D5. Although recognizing that this is an alternative plea following a denial, he saidthat the Defendants cannot blow hot and cold. I reject that. I do not consider that the Plaintiff can rely upon an alternative pleaas a positive case of agency that somehow completes the Plaintiff's case.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> I come to the alternative plea of fraudulent trading. For the purpose of this cause of action, Mr. Heslop was prepared to acceptthat "any fraudulent purpose" in section 275 of the Companies Ordinance envisages something other than the more usual defraudingof creditors. He suggested, however, that it is difficult to imagine any such purpose and that no such purpose has emerged in thiscase.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Mr. Cullen said that paragraphs 28 and 30 of CSC were pleaded so that if the Court will not otherwise infer fraud and it is necessaryto show personal benefit on the part of the Defendants, the Plaintiff will be able to pursue this at trial. Paragraph 28 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further and/or alternatively, for their own purposes or purposes unknown the Defendants in late 1983/early 1984 misrepresented theposition of the Plaintiff thus inducing the said releases and deferments of interest installments at a time when they knew or oughtto have known or were reckless as aforesaid."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>PARTICULARS</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The Plaintiff repeats Paragraph 2.5 above and the particulars thereunder;</p>        <p>(2) The Plaintiff will also refer to and rely on all the facts and matters pleaded in paragraphs 3 to 11 and 13 to 22 above;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) It was the Fifth Defendant who negotiated the said releases and deferments and he expressly misrepresented the position and didnot make plain the true state of WMI as particularised above."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Paragraph 30 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further and/or alternatively, to the extent that it was the case or can be inferred from all the aforesaid that the Defendants wereacting contrary to the interests of the Plaintiff and/or the Creditors generally and/or were acting in their own interests and notthose of WMI (Whether to try and protect their position on a charge of fraudulent trading, or to protect their position financiallyor otherwise) such were improper purposes within the Companies Ordinance (1975 and 1984)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Further and Better Particulars of paragraph 28 were sought and answered thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Of "for their own purposes or purposes unknown the Defendants in late 1983 early 1984 misrepresented the position of the Plaintiff"</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) State the nature of the Plaintiff's case as to the facts and matters referred to by the expression "their own purposes", identifyingeach such purpose relied upon.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) In relation to each Defendant, state all material facts and matters in respect of each such purpose identified as being reliedupon in support of the allegation that such purpose was their own.</p>        <p>(3) Identify to whom the purposes were unknown and if and insofar as such purposes were known to any person or body, identify eachsuch person or body.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) State the position of the Plaintiff which it is alleged the Defendants misrepresented.</p>        <p>(5) Give full particulars of the said position identifying all facts and matters upon which it is intended to rely.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Answer</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(1), (2) Purposes of their own as opposed to the interest of WMI and its creditors, such as saving face and/or retaining businesscredibility and/or retaining or obtaining personal pecuniary advantages and/or avoiding pecuniary disadvantages and/or avoiding thepotential liability of the First Defendant as General Manager of WMI.

However, the Defendants were aware that the Dalian yard considered that it was dealing with the FirstDefendant itself, and in view of the possible adverse consequences to the First Defendant, the possibility of cancelling the Daliannewbuildings was abandoned even though this was necessary for the survival of WMI as advised by S&amp;C at the Board Meeting of WMIon 9th February 1993. In a Memorandum to Directors of the First Defendant from the Fifth Defendant dated 8th February 1983 the FifthDefendant reported on meetings that had taken place between himself, the Fourth Defendant and officials of CSSC during the previousweek concerning the Dalian newbuildings. The Fifth Defendant stated in the said Memorandum that failure to perform under the Daliancontracts would have far reaching consequences for the First Defendant as he had no doubt that it was with the First Defendant thatCSSC considered they were dealing. At the Shipping Committee Meeting on 6th July 1983 the Fifth Defendant again advised that cancellingthe Dalian newbuildings would have far reaching effects and the Twelfth Defendant said that the Chinese did not differentiate betweenWMI and the First Defendant. It was thereupon agreed that no more money should be spent on the Dalian newbuildings unless and untilthe Board of WMI gave their specific direction to the contrary. These are the best particulars the Plaintiff can give.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) These purposes were unknown to the Plaintiff and WMI's creditors.

It hintsat fraudulent preference. Mr. Cullen explained, however, that fraudulent preference does not arise. The cancellation of vessels beingbuilt in Dalian was essential to WMI but would damage D1 with whom the Chinese thought they were dealing. No further attempts weremade to cancel the vessels. WMI was sacrified in the interests of D1.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> I make no apology for saying that the mind boggles at the attempts the Plaintiff has made to fix the Defendants with some form ofulterior personal motive. I have no hesitation in saying they are wholly untenable. On perhaps understandable suspicion, the Plaintiffhas built speculation and supposition. The edifice, in my judgment, lacks any substance. No sufficient or satisfactory particularshave been provided. The plea must go.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Accordingly, I order that paragraph 28 and so much of paragraph 30 as relates to this cause of action be struck out. The balanceof the two summonses to strike out I dismiss.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><u>Discovery</u></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> A measure of agreement having been reached, the Defendants restricted their application to 22 documents for the existence of whichthe Plaintiff accepts a prima facie case has been made out. The Defendants' applications involve Order 24 rules 3, 7, 8, 10, 11,13, that is, both discovery and production.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Discovery should be made or ordered of any document which may put a party on a train of enquiry that may have the effect of advancinghis own case or damaging that of his opponent. See rule 2 and <u>Compagnie Financiere Du Pacifique v. Peruvian Guano Company</u> (1882) 11 Q.B.D.55. Discovery will not be ordered if it is not necessary, and refused if it is not necessary either for disposingfairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. It is for the party objecting to discovery to satisfy the court it is not necessary.See rule 8 and <u>Dolling-Baker v. Merrett</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%202%20All%20ER%20890" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 2 All E.R. 890.</a></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Production for inspection will not be ordered unless it is similarly necessary. It is for the party applying to satisfy the courtthat it is necessary. See rule 13 and <u>Dolling-Baker</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Rule 10(1) entitles a party to serve notice seeking production of any document to which reference is made in the other party's pleadingor affidavits. The meaning of 'reference' was recently clarified in <u>Dubai Bank v. Galadari and Others (2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20WLR%20731" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 W.L.R. 731.</a> A distinction is to be drawn between a transaction and a document. At page 739, Slade L.J. giving the judgment of the Court said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In our judgment, a mere opinion that on the balance of probabilities, a transaction referred to in a pleading or affidavit must havebeen effected by a document, does not give the court jurisdiction to make an order under R.S.C., Ord. 24, r.10, unless the pleadingor affidavit makes direct allusion to the document or class of documents in question."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> At page 740, he continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Before examining those items individually, we would make one further comment. A number of words or phrases, such as "guarantee,""mandate" or "discretionary trust," will be capable of being read as a reference to a transaction in some contexts and as a referenceto a document in others. In applying R.S.C., Ord. 24, r. 10 in such cases, the task of the court must always be to extract the fairmeaning of the words used in their context."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The first issue is whether the documents or any of them are referred to in the CSOC or Further and Better <u>Particulars</u>. At first sight, the answer is "yes". In relation to the initial Sealock loan agreement made on 5th June 1981, the Plaintiff pleadsin paragraph 3.2 of CSOC that the principal security on which its parent relied was an agreement to assign certain deposits. TheDefendants sought Further and Better Particulars of every other item of security "<u>which was to be</u> provided" by WMI's subsidiary. In answer, the Plaintiff said "the other items of security <u>provided</u>" under the terms of the loan agreement were, inter alia, a counter guarantee from EKR. That, argued Mr. Heslop, is a clear referenceto a document.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> It must be noted, however, that that loan agreement was varied and never put into effect. Thus, as Mr. Cullen argued, it was a transaction.I agree. The loan agreement was plainly a document but it constituted only part of a larger transaction which might ultimately havebeen consummated by the preparation and provision of other documents such as the EKR counter guarantee.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> In any event, I am satisfied that these applications raise nothing more than a red herring. To accede to them would be to embarkon a wholly sterile line of enquiry. The combined justification offered by the Defendants is that the documents are relevant, first,to the question of reliance by the Plaintiff on the representations and, second, to quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> As to reliance, Mr. Heslop and Mr. Barma said that the two transactions cannot be looked at in isolation. They were part of a seriesof transactions going back to 1979. An examination of the conduct of the parties may show that because of the success of earliertransactions, the Plaintiff may have entered willy-nilly on these two transactions regardless of any difficulties being experiencedby WMI. Further, everyone involved was trying to find a way to solve the problem arising from WMI's difficulties in a deterioratingshipping market, where the value of the two vessels would be much less than the delivery price. Cancellation would be severe on everyoneparticularly the Danish shipyard at the time when European shipyards generally were being undercut by Asian competition. Therefore,it is not fanciful that the Plaintiff may have been influenced by such extraneous factors as well as the line of security which hadbeen and was being furnished.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> In my judgment, it is wholly idle to pretend that, whatever view the Plaintiff may have taken of earlier transactions and the securityavailable or to be made available to it, it would have been wholly uninfluenced by accurate knowledge of what is alleged to havebeen WMI's true financial position. As Mr. Cullen submitted, it is only necessary for the Plaintiff to show that the representationswere an inducing cause not <u>the</u> inducing cause. See Spencer Bower and Turner, <u>The Law of Actionable Misrepresentation</u>, 3rd edition page 139, paragraph 120. It is beside the point to argue at this stage that the representations, in the light of developmentsin the law, may or may not be actionable. If they are not, the Plaintiff will fail; if they are, the Plaintiff has a chance of success.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> As to quantum, it was argued that these documents will be relevant to the trial judge's discretion, in making an order under section275 of the Companies Ordinance, as to the amount the Defendants as directors of WMI should be made to pay. The provisions of section275 are punitive as well as compensatory. It is material to know, it was argued, what recovery if any has been made from other sources.Further, unless the Court has a complete view of the financing, the Plaintiff could affect double recovery. There may also be somerelevance as to mitigation of damage.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> I accept that the Plaintiff is not entitled to double recovery. Doubtless, the Plaintiff will clarify its position on this. I donot accept, however, that it is necessary to have discovery and production of documents for this purpose. Nor do I accept that theywill in any way assist the trial judge, if liability is established, in determining how much the directors should be ordered to payby way of compensation or possibly punishment.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Bearing in mind both the principles I set out earlier and where the burden lies, I am satisfied that discovery and production ofthese documents is not necessary. I dismiss these applications.</p>    <p><u>Further and Better Particulars</u></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> By separate summonses, the Plaintiff made 106 requests for Further and Better Particulars of the defence against D1, and 102 requestsof the other Defendants which are identical to D1's equivalent requests. Some have been satisfactorily answered or are not pursued.I will deal with each of the outstanding requests separately by reference to those made of D1. Where the numbering of the other Defendants'request does not correspond, I will include it in brackets.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> I do not need to add anything to what was said about Further and Better Particulars by the Court of Appeal, except to say that Irecognize the existence of the pregnant negative. A denial may be no more than a mere denial. It may, however, carry within it theassertion of a positive case so that particulars will be ordered. It may leave its nature in doubt so that the court must ascertainthe true position. See <u>Pinson v. Lloyds and National Provincial Foreign Bank Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281941%29%202%20KB%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1941) 2 K.B. 72.</a></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> I also note that Order 18 rule 7(2) provides that the effect of any document or purport of any conversation must <u>if material</u> be briefly stated. The provision is mandatory. That the party seeking Further and Better Particulars already has or has access toa document and does not indicate he cannot understand it, does not exempt the pleader from these provisions.</p>    <p><u>Request 5 (2) - (4)</u></p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Mr. Cullen accepted Mr. Heslop's confirmation that this relates to Clause 10 of D1's management contract and did not pursue thisrequest.</p>    <p><u>Request 6</u></p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> It is the fact that legal and financial advice was available and received that is material.

Mr. Kotewell said there is no plea that any informationwas supplied at the meetings, that is, the minutes themselves constituted the information. It may be that the Plaintiff will seekfurther particulars in the light of that explanation which I found not readily apparent. In the meantime, I make no order.</p>    <p><u>Request 88 (Request 84)</u></p>    <p><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> As in Request 38, a comparable vague phrase "effective agreement" is unsatisfactory.

They should, however, identify which part or parts of the minutes constitute that summary.I so order.</p>    <p><u>Request 98 (Request 94)</u></p>    <p><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> The admission that parent company's support would have facilitated rescheduling and the averment that such support was forthcomingare not susceptible of particulars other than those sought in paragraph (1) which the Defendants must answer.</p>    <p><u>Request 101 (5) (Request 97)</u></p>    <p><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> The averment, which is not admitted, contains two allegations.

Further and BetterParticulars having been provided, the Plaintiff asked the Defendants to particularize, to which the Defendants replied "not entitled".I do not think that answer either apt or helpful. The effect is, however, that there is a complete denial, not a conditional oneas suggested by the Plaintiff.
