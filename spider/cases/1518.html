Winland applies for summary judgment against Acro Pharm. WEX applies to set aside theleave granted by the Master to serve the Writ on WEX outside the jurisdiction. Acro Pharm is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEX.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In my view, this is not a case where summary judgment against Acro Pharm would be appropriate.  On the other hand, I think thatthe leave to serve out of the jurisdiction against WEX should be set aside.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Let me first deal with summary judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Winland claims that Acro Pharm breached an Agreement by failing to supply a drug known as âTetrodinâ and âTetrodoninâ (TTX)to Winland for sale in Peru.  TTX is manufactured in the Mainland.  Prior to October 2002 Nanning (a WEX subsidiary) held the patentfor TTX in the Mainland.  After October 2002 Nanning lost ownership of the patent to the Peopleâs Liberation Army Institute ofPharmaceutical Chemistry and Mr Qiu Fang Long (collectively, the Third Party).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Winlandâs case is essentially that Acro Pharm breached the Agreement because, not holding the intellectual property rights inTTX through WEX or any other associated company, Acro Pharm could never have supplied TTX to Winland for distribution in Peru.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Acro Pharm says (among other things) that the parties had agreed at the end of 2004 to delay commencement of the Agreement.  Inthe event, Winland (Acro Pharm notes) never placed any orders for TTX other than for free samples or placebos for carrying out tests. Acro Pharm accepts that it did not have TTX in stock.  But Acro Pharm argues that it was obliged to provide samples or placebosfor free as demanded by Winland.  It follows by cl. 5.25 of the Agreement (Acro Pharm reasons) that the Agreement never commencedat all.  The latter clause provides that âsubject to availability [of TTX]â Acro Pharm agrees âto supply to [Winland] in Peru[TTX] in accordance with orders received from [Winland]â.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Acro Pharm further alleges that Winlandâs Peruvian agents âinsistedâ that there be further testing of the effectiveness ofTTX as a drug capable of alleviating cocaine withdrawal symptoms among Peruvians.  It was for Winland (Acro Pharm contends) to arrangesuch trial as it deemed necessary.  For this reason, according to Acro Pharm, commencement of the Agreement was postponed.  But (AcroPharm complains) Winland did not carry out any trial.  Not surprisingly (Acro Pharm suggests) Winland could not place orders forTTX which it could not sell until a successful trial had taken place.  Winland then (Acro Pharm says) allowed the Peruvian SanitaryRegistration Authorisation which it had acquired for TTX to lapse.  Without that Authorisation, TTX could not be marketed in Peru.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It may possibly be that Winland has a valid argument to the effect that on a true construction of the Agreement, without the patentrights to TTX, Acro Pharm would never be in a position to perform its obligations under the Agreement.  In that case, it would beirrelevant (the argument might go) whether or not Winland carried out a particular trial or placed any order.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  But I am not persuaded that, in light of the events alleged by Acro Pharm, such argument on the part of Winland will ultimatelyprove correct.  I am unable to say now that Acro Pharmâs case would be untenable if the facts alleged by it are found to be true. I note in particular cl. 7.7 of the Agreement which arguably exempts Acro Pharm from liability in the event that it decides (asit appears to have decided) not to contest the Third Partyâs claim to the patent rights for TTX.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  For this reason, I grant Acro Pharm unconditional leave to defend.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Let me proceed to the setting aside application.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Leave was obtained to serve WEX in British Columbia under Order 11 Rules 1(1)(d) and (f).  The former concerns claims brought toenforce (or obtain relief for the breach of) a contract made in Hong Kong or governed by Hong Kong law.  The latter concerns claimsfounded on (among others) damages sustained in Hong Kong from a tort committed elsewhere. It appears that Winland is now only pursuinga case for service out under Order 11 Rule 1(1)(d).</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  I will assume (as appears to be the case) that the Agreement was made in Hong Kong.  WEX, however, was not a party to the Agreement. Instead, Winlandâs case is that the Court should lift the corporate veil and treat Acro Pharm as WEXâ alter ego.  Acro Pharm(Winland submits) was merely âa facade to cloak the fact that in truth, the Agreement and the business was carried on by WEX and... Acro Pharm was a corporate structure used by WEX to evade its legal obligation and liabilitiesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Winland is in effect alleging that WEX acted fraudulently.  The gist of the fraud (according to Winland) is that WEX never told(but rather concealed) the fact that Nanning had lost the ownership of the intellectual property rights to TTX.  This was despitecl. 5.2.10 of the Agreement whereby Acro Pharm was bound to âmake timely disclosure of all ... circumstances and everything knownto it concerning the ... transaction that would likely influence the conduct of [Winland]â.  WEX (it is said) so dominated AcroPharm that the latter had âno separate will of its ownâ.  Acro Pharm (it is suggested) was a mere shell with none of its ownstaff or offices.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Here I can see no arguable case of fraud on the materials adduced to this Court.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  To begin with, it is difficult to see how WEX can be accused of actively concealing the transfer of intellectual property rightsfrom Nanning in the Mainland.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Winlandâs own Statement of Claim pleads that WEXâ 2005 Annual Report observed that WEX had been notified in April 2005 thatâits appeal with the Chinese Patent Office concerning ownership of a patent relating to addiction withdrawal ... was not successfulâ. Winlandâs pleading quotes from a WEX press release to similar effect in June 2005.  That press release states that WEX âhasdecided to temporarily postpone development and testing of its opiate addiction withdrawal drug in Chinaâ.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  WEXâs 2006 Annual Report noted that WEX was negotiating with others in the Mainland for the transfer of ownership of the rightsin TTX to Nanning âon terms to be finalized that the Company believes will be satisfactoryâ.  The Report continued that â[t]heultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain at this time ... [and t]here can be no assurances this matter will be resolved on atimely manner or that the outcome will be resolved on a favorable basis for the Companyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  According to WEXâs 2007 Annual Report (as pleaded by Winland), WEX decided ânot to pursue the development of [TTX] ... in Canadaand China until intellectual property issues are resolved and additional financing is availableâ.  The Report further stated: âTheCompany has taken no action to counter this decision [that is, the adverse decision on WEXâs appeal to the Mainland authorities]and the Company does not currently expect to incur further costs in relation to this matterâ.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Winlandâs Statement of Claim pleads that by an Annual Information Form dated 12 February 2010 WEX noted that the Third Party hadbeen requesting transfers of the corresponding German, Belgian and French patents.  The Information Form stated: âThese developmentsaffect the patents related to use of TTX for drug withdrawal, which indication the Company has decided not to pursueâ.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In light of such publicly available material, I doubt that it can be plausibly argued that WEX actively concealed the transfer ofNanning patent rights in TTX.  The available evidence is to the contrary.  Acro Pharm may or may not have been in breach of its disclosureobligations under the Agreement.  But that is a wholly different question.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is further suggested by Mr Leo Remedios (appearing for Winland) that, at the time Acropharm and Winland entered into the Agreementin 2003, WEX ought to have (but did not disclose) to Winland that it had lost the patent rights to TTX.  That may possibly founda distinct cause of action (presently unpleaded) against WEX for misrepresentation in breach of some alleged contractual or commonlaw obligation owed by WEX to Winland.  But it seems to me that is a wholly separate matter and cannot be used as a ground for piercingthe corporate veil and treating Acropharm and WEX as identical.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  At the end of the day, Winlandâs case against WEX boils down to little more than that Acro Pharm is a wholly-owned subsidiaryof WEX.  That bare fact is insufficient to found a piercing of the corporate veil so as to treat Acro Pharm and WEX as one and thesame.  That Acro Pharm may not have had offices or staff of its own, or may have relied for its decision-making on persons who wereincidentally also officers of WEX, is neither here nor there.  Many subsidiaries of multi-national corporations operate on a similarbasis.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The bottom-line is that Winland entered, eyes wide open, into a contract with Acro Pharm, not WEX.  Winland would have been awarethat, as a subsidiary of WEX, Acro Pharm was a distinct personality from WEX.  Winland was prepared to do business with Acro Pharm,on the basis of Winlandâs perception of the creditworthiness of Acro Pharm, not WEX.  In those premises, in the absence of exceptionalcircumstances (such as cogent evidence of fraud), the Court will merely enforce the bargain struck between Acro Pharm and Winland. The Court cannot arbitrarily pierce the corporate veil to bring in WEX as a potentially liable party when that has not been contemplatedunder the relevant contract.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Consequently, there is no arguable case for holding WEX liable under the Agreement between Acro Pharm and Winland.  No other basisfor leave having been suggested, the leave to serve outside Hong Kong granted by the Master must be set aside.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I shall now hear the parties on costs and consequential orders.</p>    <p> </p>	<p> </p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(A T Reyes)<br />Judge of the Court of First Instance<br/>High Court</td>            </tr>        </table>	<!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mr Leo Remedios, instructed by Messrs Bernard Wong &amp; Co, for the Plaintiff</p>    <p>Mr Paul Carolan, instructed by Messrs Baker &amp; McKenzie, for the Defendants</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/489.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
