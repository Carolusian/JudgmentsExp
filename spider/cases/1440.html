It wasexpressly provided that no further affidavit to be filed without leave, which must be applied for at least 14 days before the dateof the hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>        No affirmation was filed by the Plaintiff in compliance with such directions and order by the middle of January 2009.  Instead,the Plaintiff filed such affirmation in opposition only on 9 May 2009, which is last Saturday, without making any application forleave to file such affirmation out of time beforehand in ample time.  No such application was even made before today until I raisedthe point at the outset of todayâs hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>        The Plaintiffsâ counsel then, upon taking instructions, applied to adjourn the matter so that they can take out a properlyconstituted application for leave to file such affirmation out of time and indicated to bear the costs of todayâs hearing.  Suchapplication for adjournment was opposed by the Defendantâs counsel, who wished to deal with the striking out application withoutfurther delay.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>        The Court is not supposed to receive evidence filed in breach of orders and directions given by the court beforehand.  Unlesswith leave of the Court, such evidence should not be admissible as evidence for the purpose of any interlocutory application either. The order of Master Lung was made back in December 2008.  If the Plaintiff seriously considered the necessity to file evidence outof time, they should make such application shortly after the expiry of the deadline or even before the expiry of the deadline, andgive grounds to justify the extension of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>        After the implementation of the Civil Justice Reform, parties should not expect the Court to exercise discretion or indulgencetoo  readily without giving good and reasonable grounds to justify an extension of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>        Of course, as a matter of fairness and justice, the Court should receive all relevant evidence for the purpose of an interlocutoryapplication if there was justification for delay.  Not a single word was put before this Court to explain the delay by the Plaintiff. So I can see no good reason why in this case the Court should exercise discretion in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>        I must also issue a warning and reminder to the parties that they are not supposed to file affirmations in support of or inopposition to the application knowing that they were filed in breach of the order given previously, knowing that they were late,and without first making an application to the court for leave to do so.  Such act was clearly in breach of the order when it wasintended that any application for leave to file and serve late affirmation should be made at least 14 days before the date of thehearing.  That was provided in the order, and should not be misunderstood by any party that they could sneak in late affirmationwithout first seeking leave from this Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>        In this case, I would consider appropriate making an order to expunge such late affirmation of the Plaintiff from the recordof the court since it was filed without leave at all and for reasons that would be apparent from the later part of this Judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>    In any event, while the adjournment was opposed by the Defendantâs counsel, it would be better for this Court to frame and identifyissues and to dispose of those issues promptly, and to decide what issues would require full investigation and trial and to disposeof other issues summarily.  These are my case management powers given to the Court under the new Order 1A of the Rules of High Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>    I see fit in this case that I should exercise such proactive case management power today instead of delaying the matter, draggingit on, and letting parties waste costs themselves and waste resources of the Court in dealing with a hopeless case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>    Why I say this is a hopeless case could be reflected from my observations made known to the parties during the course of submissionby the Plaintiffsâ counsel.  During the framing issues exercise, it was not in dispute that the two batches of money in question- that is, the âWithdrawal Moneyâ and the âSecurities Profitâ<a>[1]</a> - belonged at the material time to Sino Link Group Limited (âthe Companyâ).  Under the Statement of Claim filed at the presentmoment, both batches of money should be received by the Company, but, according to the Plaintiffs, they were misappropriated by theDefendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>    At the present moment, I do not need to decide one way or the other whether those allegations were correct or not, since, forthe purpose of a striking out, I assume that these assertions are correct for the time being.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>    I then raise the query how the Plaintiffs, being shareholders of the Company, could maintain a personal claim against the Defendant. It seems that any claim for those moneys in question should be brought by the Company itself.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>    The Plaintiffsâ counsel tried to rely upon the exceptions under <i>Foss v Harbott</i><i>le<a>[2]</a></i> and those principles as established under the English House of Lords case of <i>Johnson v</i> <i>Gore Wood &amp; Co.<a>[3]</a></i>Nevertheless, those principles are distinguished from the present case, whereby the Company in this case was dissolved already.  Nobinding authority was shown by the Plaintiffsâ counsel that the <i>Foss v</i><i> </i><i>Harbottle</i> exceptions would be applicable to a dissolved company.  All these established principles would apply only when the company stillexisted, but for one way or the other and for some reasons, the company was not able or lost right to sue the defaulting directors.In such circumstances, the court would give a remedy to the shareholders, in particular minority shareholders, to bring a derivativeaction against the defaulting directors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>    In this case, the Company was dissolved.  The Plaintiffs became ex-shareholders, and the Defendant was no longer a director ofthe Company since 1999.  So this is a cause of action accrued to the Company (if so existed at the time when the writ was commenced)against an alleged mere wrongdoer.  This may be an action on fraud.  This may be an action on tort of conversion.  But these possiblecauses of action (if any) would be accrued to the Company only. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>    I cannot see from the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs could maintain a personal claim against the Defendant at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>    Furthermore, while the moneys in question belong to the Company, how a shareholder could recover the moneys in question from athird party?  Being a shareholder, they could only obtain returns of capital investment on shares upon a declaration of dividend. So far, no admissible evidence was presented before this Court that there was such a declaration of dividend made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>    The Plaintiffsâ counsel, upon taking instructions, informed the Court that there was such a declaration, but no particularscould be given as to when such declaration of dividend was made.  Even if I assume for the time being that there was such a declarationof dividend, the Plaintiffs, being shareholders of the Company, could only obtain payment of such dividend from the Company, notfrom a third party.  In my view, there was no recognisable cause of action for shareholders to obtain payment of dividend from athird party instead of from the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>    So again, this demonstrates that the Plaintiffs could not have a viable cause of action, a personal cause of action and claim,directly against the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>    That is not the end of the matter.  One fatal point that the Plaintiffsâ counsel could find no submission to be made to arguethe otherwise: that was the application of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s292.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 292</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a><a>[4]</a> to the present case.  Again, it is not in dispute that pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s291.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 291(6)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, the Company was struck off from the register on 3 June 2005, and as a result, the Company was dissolved from the said date as providedunder the law.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>    <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s292.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 292(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> provides the consequences of such dissolution.  It states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWhen a company is dissolved, all property and rights whatsoever vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before itsdissolution, (including leasehold property but not including property held by the company on trust for any other person) shall bedeemed to be bona vacantia and shall accordingly belong to the Government, and shall vest and may be dealt with in the same manneras other bona vacantia accruing to the Government.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>    Thus, by virtue of the said provision of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, even if there was any right accrued to the Company to bring a claim against the Defendant for misappropriation of the Companyâsfunds, that right, if so existed before the dissolution of the Company, would, as a result of the dissolution, vest in the Government,and it no longer belongs to the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>    Before the Company could be restored to the register and before an order could be given by the court for such restoration, andhearing the Governmentâs submissions on those properties and rights held by them under the bona vacantia principle, the Companylost that right at the present moment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>    In such case, as at the date when the writ was commenced back in November last year, such right was not vested and accrued tothe Company.  I see no viable cause of action at all for the Plaintiffs, being ex-shareholders of the Company, to bring such an actionagainst the Defendant for money, which at one time, according to the Plaintiffs, belonged to the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>    In the premises, the Plaintiffsâ Statement of Claim is plainly and clearly bad, as the Plaintiffs had no right to sue the Defendantat all for those claims set out in the Statement of Claim when the writ was issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>    The Plaintiffsâ counsel raised the point that if that is the case, whether the Defendant, if their allegation was correct, wouldgo unclaimed by the Plaintiffs or the Company, and whether the Plaintiffs and the Company would have no remedy at all.  Firstly,I should not suspect at the present moment whether the Company could be restored to the register. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>    In any event, before the Company was dissolved back in June 2005 and after the Plaintiffs discovered the alleged misappropriationback in 2004, the Company and the Plaintiffs, who were the majority shareholders at the material time, could take appropriate actionagainst the Defendant. Knowing this particular problem, the Plaintiffs and the directors of the Company should not allow the Companyto go for dissolution despite the fact that they received proper notice from the Companies Registry of the intended action to strikeout the company under the relevant section of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>    So I must say that the Plaintiffs themselves were not in good and clean hands themselves when trying to seek equitable relieffrom this Court, and there is a maxim that the court would not assist persons who come before this Court without clean hands.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>    Whether they would still have any remedy against the wrongdoer, I could not say at the present moment. In any event, I can saythat the present action brought by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant lacked any viable cause of action at the time when it wasissued, and clearly, if there were any rights accrued to the shareholders for a derivative action against the Defendant, relyingupon the principles established under the English House of Lords case of <i>Johnson v</i> <i>Gore Wood</i>, such rights could not be exercised now.  The present action is clearly premature.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>    As a result of these observations, the Court should exercise active case management power to terminate the action brought by thePlaintiffs against the Defendant today instead of allowing it to drag on, wasting the partiesâ costs and wasting the courtâsresources.  In this connection, I am also in mind that those applications taken out by the Defendant against the Plaintiffs duringthe interim requesting for further and better particulars of the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>    While it is correct for the Defendantâs counsel to say that such kind of application is not mutually exclusive, but definitelythat is not an effective way to deal with the matter expeditiously and fairly.  If the Defendant focused his mind on the main issuesthat I brought up today for the purpose of framing the issues, these steps and applications could be avoided and costs could be saved.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>    I note in this case at least there were two to three substantive hearings for arguments before: firstly, the request for furtherand better particulars; secondly, the joinder of the Company as the Plaintiff; and lately, the enforcement of the unless order forfurther and better particulars.  These substantive hearings could be avoided if parties are willing to identify issues at an earlystage.  That is the reason why the Court nowadays takes the view that early identification of issues is imperative, so that partieswill not be misguided to other peripheral issues that could not dispose of the matter fairly and justly. Arguing such peripheralmatters would do no good at all to have an effective and fair resolution of the disputes between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>    In the circumstances, for this case, I would exercise my case management power and discretion to strike out the PlaintiffsâStatement of Claim, as it shows no reasonable cause of action. The Plaintiffsâ action against the Defendant be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>    I make the following orders.  The Plaintiffsâ Statement of Claim be struck out for disclosing no reasonable cause of actionat the time of the issue of the writ, and the action herein against the Defendant be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Submission on costs)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>    I am prepared in this case to exercise my power under paragraph 30 of the Practice Directions 5.4 for the consequences of non-complianceof directions.  The fact that this is the second time after the implementation of CJR that I need to consider exercising such power.Paragraph 30 states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThose not observing or complying with these directions may be called upon to explain such failure and in the absence of a satisfactoryexplanation may be penalised in costs irrespective of whether or not they are parties who succeed in the application.  Parties arewarned that to ensure observance of and compliance with these directions, a party who has breached any of such directions may, despitetheir success in the application or appeal, still be deprived of all or part of his costs of the application or appeal as penalty. Further, such costs penalty may be imposed irrespective of whether or not the breach had resulted in any adjournment of hearingor any other form of waste of time and costs.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(Submission on breach of directions)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>    I think in this case, costs should follow events.  Plaintiffsâ counsel made no other submission than the usual costs order,save I will say that both parties are at blame for incurring unnecessary costs in this particular matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>    When the Court considers granting costs order and eventually to assess quantum, conduct of the parties would be called into question.In this case, both Plaintiffs and Defendant failed to comply with Practice Direction 5.4.  The Plaintiffsâ counsel explained thattheir clients may be demanding on what they would say at the hearing.  Be there it may be, that provides no excuse for non-compliance. If, for one reason or another, the clients may be demanding, bearing in mind the time lines and the deadline for filing writtensubmissions, preparation should be started earlier so that the written submissions could be filed and served in good time in compliancewith the Practice Direction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>    I have already explained why the Court expects due compliance of such Practice Direction.  Without the full co-operation and theassistance of parties and their legal representatives, the Court will not be in a position to read all the papers in good time, tounderstand them and to digest the arguments on the issues in question so that appropriate case management power could be exercisedduring the hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>    In this case, it demonstrates quite clearly that if the Court did not exercise such case management power to identify issues today,the matter may have to drag on for another month, not to say another year, before it could go for trial or to have the matter resolved.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>    I hope in future both parties and their legal representatives should adhere to the deadline and the time line imposed by the Rulesand the Practice Directions.  Non-compliance of the same will expect no leniency from the Court without good and reasonable explanation. I must say the Court will be more ready to impose court sanctions for breach of Practice Directions and Rules.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>    In this case, while the Defendant will obtain costs, such costs will be assessed gross sum.  I will to some extent adjust anddisallow some of the costs incurred during the course of the action and for preparation for this hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>    Unfortunately, both counsel did not take up the main issue that would be determinative for this application in their written submissions,and rather to labour on other peripheral issues. I think that would be something that I would reflect in the costs order also.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>    Costs of this action, including costs of this application, be to the Defendant with certificate for counsel, such costs to beassessed gross sum unless the same can be agreed between parties within 14 days from today.  Failing an agreement, parties do restorea hearing before me within 21 days from today with half-hour reserved, and the Defendantâs solicitors do lodge and serve a costsstatement 7 days before the adjourned hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>    I will make a note and remark here both the solicitorsâ costs of the action and the counselâs brief for todayâs hearingwill be adjusted in light of my ruling today.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">46.</a>    Affirmations of the 1st Plaintiff filed without leave of the court on 9 May 2009 be expunged from the record of the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(S Kwang)<br />            Master of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Andrew C H Y Leung, instructed by Kenneth Poon &amp; Co, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Timon K L Shum, instructed by Hon &amp; Co, for the Defendant</p>        <hr style="text-align:left" width="33%" />        <p style="text-align:justify"><a>[1]</a> As defined in paras. 3 &amp; 4 of the Skeleton Submission of the Plaintiffâs Counsel dated 11/5/2009 and paras. 4 &amp; 5 of theStatement of Claim.</p>        <p><a>[2]</a> (1843)2 Hare 461</p>        <p><a>[3]</a>  [2002] 2 AC1</p>        <p><a>[4]</a> Chapter 32, Laws of Hong Kong</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/711.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
