By a gazette notice dated 26 July 2001 (G.N. 4520), a right of temporary occupation was createdfor 1,066.2 m<sup>2</sup> of Lot 414 in DD 399 and 1,163.4 m<sup>2</sup> of Lot 415 in DD 399 (the temporary occupation area is hereinafter referred to as âthe TOAâ whilst the said two lots are referredto as âthe Lotsâ), together with other pieces or parcels of land for carrying out any operations or installing, maintaining orremoving any structures or apparatus in relation to Castle Peak Road Improvement between Area 2 and Sham Tseng of Tsuen Wan (detailedin the PWP Item 6365TH) (âthe Road Projectâ) under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/370/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15(1)</a> of the Ordinance.  The said right of temporary occupation was created in favour of the Respondent upon expiry of 3 months from thedate upon which the said gazette notice was affixed on or near the TOA , i.e. commencing from 27 October 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> In the said gazette notice, it was stated that the said right of temporary occupation âshall be created in favour of the Governmentof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the purposes of or incidental to the works or use describedâ in the Scheme,which was defined to include the various schemes of works referred to in G.N. Nos. 3309, 2874, 3565 and 4746.  In particular, itwas stated in the G.N. 4520 that the first publication date of the first G.N. 3309 giving notice to the general public (includingthe Applicant and the owners of other affected land) describing the general nature of the proposed scheme of road works was 10 July1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> It was not disputed by the parties that the commencement date of the temporary occupation of the TOA was 27 October 2001.  Also,they agreed that upon completion of the works and use under the Road Project, the TOA was handed over to the Applicant by the Respondenton 6 July 2004.  Therefore, although the said G.N. 4520 allowed the Respondent to temporarily occupy the TOA for 48 months, the actualoccupation period was only for about 2.7 years.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Lots were under the same ownership of the Applicant.  The Respondent by a letter dated 16 October 2001 invited the Applicantto submit a claim under the Ordinance for the TOA.  A few months earlier, on 27 July 2001, a small portion of the Lots (Section Aof Lot 414 in DD399) having an area of 162.7 m<sup>2</sup> fronting Castle Peak Road was resumed for the same Road Project under the Resumption Notice of G.N. 2612 dated 26 April 2001 as amendedby Corrigendum G.N. 4300 dated 13 July 2001.  The compensation for that portion of the Lots was determined by the Lands Tribunalin <i>Di</i><i>s</i><i>creet Limited v Secretary for Transport</i> (unreported, judgment dated 25 July 2003, reference LDMR 14 of 2002).  The Tribunal awarded compensation to the Applicant in thesum of $1,530,000, equivalent to $9,404 per m<sup>2</sup> of land resumed.  The assessment was computed by the Tribunal on the basis of the difference of value of the Lots before and afterthe resumption (which methodology was also adopted by the experts representing both sides), as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Before Resumption                             $26,037,503<br />        After Resumption                               <u>$24,507,010<br /></u> Compensation                                      $1,530,493</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">There was no appeal from either side on the said determination by the Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Applicant, represented by Mr. Charles C P Lai of Surpass Property Strategy Consultant and the Respondent, represented by theLands Department, failed to reach agreement on the compensation payable to the Applicant for the creation of the rights of temporaryoccupation over the TOA.  The Applicant consequently made an application to the Lands Tribunal against the Respondent for the determinationof the amount of compensation payable to the Applicant.  This Judgment sets down the background, the Law, the issues, the disputesbetween the parties and the Tribunalâs findings and determination.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Particulars of the Lots, the TOA and the house formerly standing on the TOA</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Prior to the temporary occupation by the Respondent, the Lots comprised a piece of flat land at the middle with sloping land towardsthe northern and southern boundaries.  This was indicated in the site plan produced by the parties, the Plan No. TWM2933c preparedby District Survey Office for the said G.N. 4520. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Lots are held under New Grant No. 3413 for âbuilding and gardenâ purposes.  Any developments erected or to be erected thereonare governed by G.N. 364 of 1934 as amended by G.N. 50 of 1940.  Therefore, any development of the Lots is restricted to a maximumheight of 2 storeys and 25 feet with a maximum site coverage of 2/3, i.e. with a maximum plot ratio of about 1.33.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The parties agreed on the following land areas: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  areas of the Lots (excluding the resumed area of Lot 414 s.A of 162.7m<sup>2</sup>) = 2,624.36 m<sup>2</sup></p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  area of TOA = 2,229.6 m<sup>2</sup></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Other than the above agreed figures, the parties failed to have agreements on other areas to be used in their valuations.  Therefore,we will first determine these disputes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The house formerly standing on the TOA was demolished well before the 2 experts preparing the valuation reports and giving evidencein this case were instructed.  The 2 experts failed to reach agreement on the area of the house.  Mr. Lau Tak Francis, the expertsurveyor called by the Applicant (âAWâ) proposed to use an average of the following 3 figures in arriving at the area of thedemolished single storey villa house: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  area of the house as reported by Mr. Charles CP Lai, the previous consultant surveyor employed by the Applicant in his valuationreport, i.e. 186 m<sup>2</sup>;</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  area of the house from survey sheet measurement as quoted by Ms. Leung Miu-yin Karen (âRWâ), the expert surveyor called bythe Respondent in her valuation reports, i.e. 167.7 m<sup>2</sup>; and</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)  another area of the house, the roof-over area as measured by Land Surveyor / Tsuen Wan from a survey sheet and reported by RWin her report, i.e. 231.7 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Hence, AW arrived at a figure of 195.13 m<sup>2</sup> and used this in his estimation of the Open Market Rent (âOMRâ) for the house portion of the TOA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On the other hand, RW opined that in the absence of any accurate record, the area of the demolished house should be based on thearea as measured from the survey sheet.  RW contended that although Mr. Charles C P Lai reported an area of 186 m<sup>2</sup> and produced a sketch plan in his valuation report, she noted that the sketch plan was not to scale and there were only a few dimensionsin the plan.  On the other hand, the area as scaled off from the Respondentâs survey sheet should be relied upon in the absenceof better evidence.  Therefore, in assessing the OMR of the TOA in her primary valuation on the basis of house use for the structureand garden use for the land, she opined that the area of the house obtained from scaling off the survey sheet, i.e. 167.7 m<sup>2</sup> should be adopted.  Notwithstanding this, RW accepted to use the area of 195.13 m<sup>2</sup> as quoted by AW when assessing the OMR of the house in her alternative valuation, which was made on the basis of covered storageand workshop use for the house structure and open storage use for the land.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Since the Applicant failed to substantiate the figure of 186 m<sup>2</sup> as quoted by Mr. Charles C P Lai, which was challenged by the Respondent who sought to rely on scaled measurements of the surveysheet, we agree with RW to use the latter figure of 167.7 m<sup>2</sup>.  As to the difference between the roof-over area of 231.7 m<sup>2</sup> and the much smaller area of 167.7 m<sup>2</sup>, this is not unusual bearing in mind that the villa house had large canopies and flower beds and the like.  But as a general ruleand even in the standard method of measurement of properties adopted by the surveying and the real estate profession, in calculatingthe area of a house, the areas representing large canopies etc. would not be treated as the house area per se.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Also, in the alternative valuation assuming that the house structure was used for covered storage and workshop purpose, RWâs concessionto adopt AWâs suggested area of 195.13 m<sup>2</sup> is reasonable.  As said before, portion of the house structure extending to about 64 m<sup>2</sup> (difference between 231.7 m<sup>2</sup> and 167.7 m<sup>2</sup>) roofed over as canopy, etc., would attract a higher rental value than open land if the said portion was used for storage.  So, byaccepting a higher area of 195.13 m<sup>2</sup> (a difference of 27.43 m<sup>2</sup> from the RWâs estimated house area of 167.7 m<sup>2</sup>), this could compensate for the extra value of the roofed over but not enclosed area of 64 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> There were also disputes between AW and RW on the extent of flat land or sloping land.  So, in AWâs various valuation reports,the areas quoted differed from those adopted by RW.  However, in the Written Final Submission of counsel for the Respondent, revisedcomputation sheets show that AW agreed to change his earlier figures after he decided to adopt RWâs estimated area of the Lotsof 2,642.36 m<sup>2</sup>.  Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the OMR of the Lots, AW used 195.13 m<sup>2</sup> as the house structure area and 2,429.23 m<sup>2</sup> (i.e. 2,624.36 m<sup>2</sup> less 195.13 m<sup>2</sup>) as the land area.  AW further opined that in both his primary and alternative valuations (i.e. for open storage &amp; workshop use,and garden use respectively), the Applicant should be compensated for the loss of rent over this entire land area of 2,429.23 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> On the other hand, RW gave evidence that based on the advice given to her by Land Surveyor/Tsuen Wan of The District Survey Office/TsuenWan and Kwai Tsing of Lands Department, as at the date of creation of rights of temporary occupation, the various areas are as  follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="80%">            <tr>                <td width="100%" colspan="2" style="text-align:center"><u>Total of Lot 414 RP and Lot 415</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Sloping Land</td>                <td width="37%">852.9 m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Flat Land</td>                <td width="37%">1,209 m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">House</td>                <td width="37%"><u>167.7 m</u><sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%"> </td>                <td width="37%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Temporary Occupation Area (TOA)</td>                <td width="37%">2,229.6 m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Non-TOA Area </td>                <td width="37%"><u>394.76 m</u><sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Total area of the Lots</td>                <td width="37%">2,624.36 m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">(excluding resumed area of Lot 414 s.A)</td>                <td width="37%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%"> </td>                <td width="37%"> </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> RW confirmed that the various areas were obtained by the said Land Surveyor by means of survey sheet measurements.

They are re-stated below: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   The determination of the loss of rent of the TOA from the date of the creation of the rights of temporary occupation (i.e. 27October 2001) to the date of handover of the TOA back to the Applicant (i.e. 6 July 2004).  This includes the following sub-issues:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)   the assessment of the loss of rent for the different portions of the TOA (i.e. the house and the land); and</p>            <p>(b)   whether the loss of rent to the Applicant should also cover the non-TOA area of the lots;</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   Whether the Applicant is entitled to claim for the loss of rent of the TOA and the non-TOA area of the lots for the following2 additional periods:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   from the date of the first publications of G.N. 3309 affecting the lots (i.e. 10 July 1998) to the date before the creationof the rights of temporary occupation of the TOA (i.e. 26 October 2001); and</p>            <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   from the date after the handover of the TOA back to the Applicant (i.e. 7 July 2004) to the date when the house together withthe land of the lots were assumed to be reinstated and ready to let (estimated by AW to be 2 years from the date of handover, i.e.7 July 2006)</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)   Whether the Applicant is entitled to claim disturbance payments for the physical or structural damage to the Lots includingthe following:</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   the reinstatement cost of the house and its assessment;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   the additional costs for piling for building development to avoid loading on the bored pile retaining wall no. BPRW 37 builtby the Highway Departmentâs contractor and its assessment;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify">(c)   the additional cost of constructing the outstanding section of 16 metres of Road R3 and its assessment;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> During the hearing, the parties agreed on the assessments for the last 2 items of works set out in the last paragraph, so they dispensedwith calling their experts to give evidence on these estimations.  However, the parties still disagreed on the issue of entitlementfor these 2 items.  We will deal with these in a separate section below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Also, there were originally 3 more issues, namely the disturbance payment for the extra expenditures to be incurred by the Applicantfor âelevated deck and piling for reinstating the over-excavated portions of the platform and Slope No. 22â in the agreed sumof $5,013,000 as well for âconstruction of widened section of road R3â in the agreed sum of $574,275, and the issue raised bythe Respondent as to whether a set off in disturbance payment for the âcost saving for bulk excavation into Slope 22 carried outby Highways Departmentâ in the agreed sum of $712,500 should be credited.  However, since during the hearing the Respondent abandonedthese 2 claims and the Applicant also abandoned the said set off, there was no need to discuss these 3 issues any further. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Applicantâs claims and the Respondentâs assessments</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Applicant instructed an expert surveyor, Mr. Charles C P Lai to file claims to the Lands Department on 24 July 2002 and 18 November2002.  Since January 2005, the Applicant has instructed another expert surveyor, AW to prepare valuation reports and revise the claims. AW has altogether filed 3 valuation reports.  He also gave evidence at the hearing.  Similarly, the Respondent instructed an expertsurveyor, RW who has filed a total of 4 valuation reports and gave evidence at the hearing.  Although their methods of valuationwere basically the same, and their comparables for the assessment of house rentals were also the same, they failed to have consensusopinion on most issues.  Also, as already stated above, they did not have agreement on certain factual information such as the areaof the house, and differed a lot in their valuation opinion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> A summary of the Applicantâs claims and the Respondentâs assessments is set out in the Table 1 below.  All the revisions madeby the 2 experts and the concessions given by both parties have already been reflected in the said table.  These include some lastminute changes made by AW and reported in the Final Written Submission given by counsel for the Applicant.  These changes were neededto reflect the change in the valuation date by AW.  Based on the higher of the 2 different valuations on the rental value of theLots, the total claim of the Applicant was $22,576,673 whilst the total assessment made by the Respondent was $2,530,000.  The differencein valuations between AW and RW is about 9 times.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In summary, if we look at the broad picture of the higher of AWâs estimated claims under the 2 different scenarios, we find thathis total claim for loss of rent, in his primary valuation, is about $12.6 million.  Since he claimed for a total period of about8 years (actually 8 years less 4 days, from 10 July 1998 to 6 July 2006), including about 3.3 years before the actual period of occupation,about 2.7 years of actual period of occupation and 2 years post-actual occupation, the annual loss of rent he estimated is about$1.6 million.  On the other hand, RW estimated the loss of rent in the sum of about $0.2 million per year and applied that for theactual period of temporary occupation of about 2.7 years.  So, as far as the assessment of the OMR is concerned, the 2 expertsâopinion is about 8 times in difference.  We find this to be very unusual.</p>    <p><u>Table 1- Summary of the Applicantâs Claim and the Respondentâs assessment</u></p>    <table border="1" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="16%" colspan="3" align="left" valign="top"></td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><u><span><font size="2">The Applicantâs claims</font></span></u></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" colspan="4" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><u><span><font size="2">The Respondentâs assessments</font></span></u></p>            </td>            <td width="2">                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">                <p><font size="2">Heads of Claim</font></p>                <p><font size="2">(the periods are those put forward by the Applicantâs witness, AW)</font></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p><font size="2">Item under Part II of Schedule to the Ordinance</font></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">Scenario </font></span><font size="2">I</font></p>                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">(primary valuation)</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">Scenario</font></span> <span><font size="2">II</font></span></p>                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">(alternative valuation)</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">Scenario</font></span> <span><font size="2">I</font></span></p>                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">(primary valuation)</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">Scenario</font></span> <span><font size="2">II</font></span></p>                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">(alternative valuation)</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="2">                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">--</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span><font size="2">--</font></span></p>            </td>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top"><font size="2">âhouseâ use for structure and âopen storage and workshopâ use for land)</font></td>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top"><font size="2">âhouseâ use for structure and âgardenâ use for land)</font><br /></td>            <td width="16%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><font size="2">âhouseâ use for structure and âgardenâ use for land</font><br /></td>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top"><font size="2">âcovered storage and workshopâ use for structure and âopen storageâ use for land</font><br /></td>            <td width="15%" colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">                <p><font size="2">(1) Loss of rent from the date of the first publication of the G.N.

style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Another unusual feature in this case is that even the valuation date previously adopted by AW in his reports and his oral testimonydiffered from that adopted by RW.  And during the hearing when AW was cross-examined by counsel for the Respondent, AW still stoodby his opinion that the relevant valuation date for the assessment of âloss of rentâ compensation payable to the Applicant shouldbe 10 July 1998, instead of 27 October 2001 as contended by RW.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> However, AW advised counsel for the Applicant that he had reconsidered the matter and agreed to use the date of 27 October 2001,which was all along adopted by RW.  As a result, AW had to make changes for all his adjustments to the comparables.  In short, heabandoned all his time adjustments and agreed to use all the time adjustments suggested by RW.  Also, he made consequential changesto his assessments of the OMR for the TOA and the Lots and the compensation payable to the Applicant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> We do think that expert surveyors should pay more attention to this issue of the correct valuation date from the beginning to avoidthe need to make amendments both before and during a hearing for compensation claims.  As pointed out by counsel for the Respondent,the date of valuation is clearly set down under s.12 (Date of valuation and interest) of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Ordinance.If an expert surveyor has any problem in confirming the relevant date of valuation, he should be prepared, subject to taking instructionfrom his client, to consult his clientâs lawyer.  This would obviously simplify the differences in computations between the partiesand alleviate the tasks of the Tribunal in understanding their different figures in their series of valuation reports produced.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessment of OMR for the TOA or the Lots by AW and RW</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> We have summarized the various OMR valuations prepared by AW and RW in Table 2 below.  In AWâs Scenario I, he assumed the use ofthe house structure for house use whilst the entire land portion was put for open storage and workshop use.  We note that there wasno provision at all for any space for the parking of the tenantâs car.  Also, there was no allowance for the fact that a tenantof the subject house would be prepared to occupy the house at a rent comparable to other houses in a residential neighbourhood butthe house itself was entirely surrounded by open storage and workshop uses.  We are doubtful if in the market, any tenant would beprepared to pay a market rent (assessed by AW at the sum of $13,415 per month) under the circumstances.  We also note that in AWâscalculations, he did not comment about his estimated open market rent per month for the different portions of the Lots, i.e. thehouse and the land portions.  Instead, he just show his mathematics of arriving at his estimated loss of rent for different periodsof time.  He was too bogged down with his mathematical calculations in his valuation reports but seemed to have lost sight of, ascommented by counsel for the Respondent, any âbig pictureâ assessment of the case.

class="heading">Assumed uses for the TOA or the Lots for the purpose of assessing the loss of rent</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> It was AWâs case that since the Respondentâs road works contractor used the TOA for the purpose of resident site staffâs office,workshop for repair and maintenance of construction plant, and storage of construction materials, it must be the case that in undertakingthe valuation of the TOA for the temporary occupation period as well as for the periods prior to and subsequent to the temporaryoccupation, the Applicant could assume, as of right, that the TOA (including the structure and the land) could be put to such âactualâuses.  Hence, AW considered that comparables of open storage and workshop instead of garden comparables should be chosen.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> AW justified his above argument by giving evidence that during his site visit to the Lots, prior to their return to the Applicant,the Lots had actually been used by the road works contractor as its resident site staff office, workshop for repair and maintenanceconstruction plant, and storage of construction materials.  We do not agree with AW on this point.  The TOA was required specificallyfor the purpose in connection with the Road Project.  So, it must be the case that the TOA was actually put for such uses.  However,we do not agree that just because there was evidence that the TOA was actually used for the said purposes, the highest and best useof the TOA or the Lots for rent must be for the same purposes. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> It is trite law that in assessing compensation, we cannot simply assume that the land could be used for the specific purpose forwhich the land was compulsorily resumed.  Although the present case involves temporary occupation of land, the same general principleshould also apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In addition AW argued that since the Lots were held for the purpose of building and garden, subject to what was usually known asthe âG.N. 364 conditionsâ, the Lots should be valued on the basis that it could put to car repairing uses and fee paying carpark uses, and that we should assume that the Lots could be let out, not only with the benefit of the house structure then standingon the Lots but with the benefit of a much larger notional structure with the gross floor area extending to 1.33 times the area ofthe Lots.  It seems to us that AW lost sight of the need to ascertain the market situation surrounding the Lots.  In valuation ofa property, we should not assume that since there is no restriction under the lease, we should value the property for all the usesthat are permitted.  Certainly we have to consider the location of the property, the demand for the proposed uses, particularly ifit was not the actual use or a former use, as well as the market reality before deciding whether the property should be put to theproposed uses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The Lots are located between Area 2 and Sham Tseng of Tsuen Wan, on the hill ward side of Castle Peak Road with the neighbourhoodzoned for residential and green belt.  On basis of evidence adduced by the parties, we find on balance of probabilities that theLots were, at the relevant date of valuation, not suitable for use as a fee-paying car park or for car repairing use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Also, when valuing the TOA or the Lots for the purpose of open storage and workshop use, AW applied the same rate to all the slopingland as well as the flat land because the Respondentâs contractor was using the sloping land as well as the flat land.  For thesame reason as stated before, we should not assume that just because the Respondent requires or actually uses the resumed land fora certain use or in a certain manner, we should assess compensation on the basis of the same use or manner of use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Besides, as rightly pointed out by the Respondent, the Respondent required the temporary occupation of the TOA so that the levelof portion of the TOA could be lowered.  The Respondent definitely would need to enter into all portions of the TOA including usingpart of it for storage.  However, it does not follow that the Respondent could use the sloping land, including the natural slopeat the back for storage use. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessment of OMR of structure for house use</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Having considered all the evidenced adduce by the parties, we adjusted the commonly adopted house rental comparables for variousfactors of adjustments identified by the 2 expert surveyors.  As for any valuation, we held the same view for some factors and hadour own view for some other factors.  At the end, we arrived at an average adjusted unit rate of $49.13/m<sup>2</sup> p.m. or $589.44/m<sup>2</sup> p.a.

</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">We discuss in more details below our adopted adjustments: -</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Time</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Both AW and RW used the same rental index as the basis for adjustments.  Following the last minute amendment of AW in the relevantdate for the assessment of loss of rent to 27 October 2001, counsel for the Applicant confirmed in his Final Submission that therewas no longer any difference between Aw and RW on this factor of adjustment.  We accept the agreed adjustments of AW and RW for time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Building Condition</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Both AW and RW attributed substantial adjustments for this factor.  AW allowed for adjustments ranging from â30% to â70% whilstRW allowed for adjustments of between â50% and â70%.  This suggests that to both expert surveyors, the comparables were far muchbetter in condition than the house on the Lots, which had been demolished.  We appreciate the difficulties for the expert surveyorsof adopting a reasoned adjustment for this factor of adjustment, bearing in mind that neither of them had even the opportunity ofviewing the external of the house close to the relevant valuation date prior to its demolition.  For the same reason, we find itdifficult to attribute an adjustment percentage for this factor.  However, we do not agree with the contention of AW that as an alternativebasis, we should take into account the estimated cost of renovation given to the Applicant.  Firstly, we do not think that the contractorhas sufficient information to carry out his estimate.  Secondly and more importantly, in assessing the OMR of a house, it is morelikely than not that a prospective willing tenant in the market will not take all the trouble of seriously consider the estimatedcost of renovation (which amounts to about $0.75 million, based on AWâs evidence of the contractorâs estimate), the return orannual equivalent of such cost before deciding on the rent that the tenant is prepared to pay.  At the end, we decide to adopt theaverage of the adjustments proposed by AW and RW. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Sea view</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Both AW and RW agreed that no adjustment was warranted for Comparables H1, H3 and H5, and the same minor adjustment applied to ComparableH2.  We adopted their opinion for these 4 comparables.  They both agreed that an upward adjustment was warranted for Comparable H4but they did not agree on the degree of adjustment.  Having regard to the evidence of AW and RW, including the location plan andthe photographs showing the comparables, we are of the view that AWâs opinion was more likely to be correct than RW.  Therefore,we adopt AWâs adjustment of 5% for Comparable H4.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Location and accessibility</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">AW and RW first differed in opinion as to whether a separate item of adjustment was warranted for the factor of accessibility.  Theyalso differed in their adjustments for the factor of location.  In particular, RW attributed a total adjustment of 30% of both factorscombined for Comparable H5.  We agreed with the Applicant that this is far too much.  After detailed consideration of the evidence,we gave our opinion in the above table our adopted adjustments for these 2 factors combined.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Traffic Noise</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">AW and RW again differed much in their opinion on this factor of adjustment.  We basically agree with RW on most of the adjustmentsfor the comparables on this factor.  We agree that this site, with its location next to Castle Peak Road and not far away from manymajor highways suffered from traffic noise.  Therefore, we follow closer to AW in our choice of adjustment percentages for this factorof adjustment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Size</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Both AW and RW applied only minor adjustments to the comparables.  We agree to adopt RWâs adjustments or nil adjustment (where appropriate)to all the comparables with the exception of Comparable H5.  For Comparable 5, AW opined that an adjustment of â5% was appropriatewhilst RW suggested a smaller adjustment of â3%.  Having regard to the large size difference between the subject structure on theLots and Comparable H5, we prefer to adopt AWâs figure of â5%.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Privacy</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify">AW attributed a factor of 2% for Comparable H2 only.  For the other comparables, AW opined that no adjustment was required.  On theother hand, RW only agreed that no adjustment was warranted for Comparable H5 but suggested adjustments of 5%, 8 % and 5% for ComparablesH1, H3 and H4 respectively.

AW opined that no separate adjustment for this factor was warranted whilst RW suggested5% each for Comparables H1, H3 and H5.  We accept RWâs opinion in this regard.  However, as we assess the OMR of the Lots in alater section, we will take into account the fact that it was the RWâs case that there was car-parking provision on the Lots forthe tenant of the house standing thereon.  So, in assessing the OMR of the land portion of the Lots for open storage and workshopuse, we find that we have to make allowance for certain area of land that has to be reserved for parking and access.  Otherwise,it will amount to double counting. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessment of OMR of structure for covered storage and workshop use</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> AW produced no comparable for the covered storage and workshop use.

This isbecause the tenancy is permitted for use as workshop subject to 100% site coverage with gross floor area of not exceeding 270 m<sup>2</sup>.  The tenancy was tendered at a rent of $108,000 p.a.  After using an adjustment factor of 0.6 to the upper floor workshop or storagearea, RW estimated the effective area of the tenancy to be 216 m<sup>2</sup>.  The rent equated to $500/ m<sup>2</sup>.  RW allowed a total adjustment of -37% giving an adjusted unit rate of $315/m<sup>2</sup>.  We have considered the adjustments made by RW and decided to adopt the following adjustments: -</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="50%">            <tr>                <td width="63%">Structure</td>                <td width="37%">-10%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Time</td>                <td width="37%">1%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Location</td>                <td width="37%">-5%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Security of tenure</td>                <td width="37%"><u>-3%</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Total adjustment</td>                <td width="37%">-17%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="63%">Adjusted unit rate</td>                <td width="37%">$415/m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Therefore, relying on this comparable, we estimate the unit rate for the house structure of the TOA for covered storage and workshopuse to be $415/m<sup>2</sup> p.a..</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessment of OMR of land for garden use</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> AW suggested in his alternative valuation that the best evidence for land in the TOA or the Lots for garden use are (1) the StandardRates adopted by the Respondent for the existing and new short term tenancies (for conversion and regularization cases) of Governmentland in the New Territories.  He quoted a schedule of âstandard ratesâ that he said was applicable from 1 April 2002.  Therewas a range of rates, in this quoted list of standard rates, ranging from $214/m<sup>2</sup> for the âHigh Rate Zoneâ and $121/m<sup>2</sup> for the âLow Rate Zoneâ in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Chung Area.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In addition, he quoted a comparable of Short Term Tenancy (No. KX2033 located at Kai Tak, Kowloon) which was used for RecreationalPurpose (i.e. Golf Center and such ancillary facilities as may be approved in writing by the District Lands Officer).  The tenancyof land of 148,600 m<sup>2</sup>, awarded by way of tender on 23 November 1999, was let at a yearly rent of $19,200,000 (or a monthly rent of $1,600,000), or at aunit rate of $129/m<sup>2</sup> p.a.  Based on these comparables, AW adopted a unit rate of $130/m<sup>2</sup> p.a. for valuing the land for garden use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> On the other hand, RW produced in her valuation reports a schedule of comparable rents.  After making adjustments, she opined thatan appropriate unit rate was $100 /m<sup>2</sup> p.a.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> AW failed to produce other rental evidence in support of his conclusion of value.  He reiterated that his evidence is the best evidence. In addition, he attacked the relevance of RWâs comparables and the adjustments made by RW.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> On the contrary, we find that the comparables quoted by AW were irrelevant.  Firstly, the standard rates adopted by the Respondentfor the conversion and regularization of short-term tenancies were not comparables.  AW contended that most of the comparables usedby RW were rent review cases all with the Respondent as the landlord.  However, the tenants in those cases could have the choiceof whether agreeing or not agreeing the rents offered at reviews.  For the only tender comparable quoted by AW, it was obviouslya very different piece of land from that of the TOA or the Lots.  Therefore, after discarding Rental Comparable G1 and G4 that hadsloping land, we find that the remaining comparables of RW range from $77 to $100.  In particular, we find that the comparable atWah King Hill Road, Kwai Chung was only let at a rate of $77/m<sup>2</sup> p.a.  Having regard to all the evidence, we therefore agree with RW that it would be very reasonable to value the garden land atthe rate of $100 /m<sup>2</sup> p.a.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessment of OMR of land for open storage use</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Based on 3 comparables (referenced W1, W2 and W3) all of which were located in Kwai Tsing, an industrial area, AW estimated the unitrate for the land for open storage use in the unit rate of $586 /m<sup>2</sup> p.a.  However, as pointed out by RW, the actual uses of these 3 comparables were as a fee paying public car park, a vehicular repairingcentre and a workshop respectively.  Therefore, we agree with RW that the comparables W1 (i.e. STT 3458) and W2 (i.e. STT 3467) areclearly irrelevant for assessment of the land of the TOA or the Lots.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> We further agree with RW that Comparable W3 (i.e. STT 3462) is also not suitable as a comparable for open storage use because thetenancy is permitted for 100% site coverage with gross floor area of not exceeding 270 m<sup>2</sup>.  For this reason, we agree to adopt the 4<sup>th</sup> comparable. W4 (STT3520) identified by RW.  We note that the tendered rent for the tenancy at Tsing Yi Road, Area 20, Tsing Yi, is$277,296.  With a site area of 2,180 m<sup>2</sup> (comprising flat area of 1,770 m<sup>2</sup> and sloping area of 410 m<sup>2</sup> ), the rent breaks down to a unit rate of $156.66/ m<sup>2</sup> (based on the flat area alone).  RW made adjustments to this comparable bringing down the adjusted unit rate to $114 m<sup>2</sup>.  We have reviewed RWâs adjustments and considered to adopt the following adjustments instead: -</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="70%">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Size</td>                <td width="50%">0%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Time</td>                <td width="50%">8%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Location</td>                <td width="50%">-20%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Security of tenure</td>                <td width="50%"><u>10%</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Total adjustment</td>                <td width="50%">-2%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Adjusted unit rate</td>                <td width="50%">$153.53 rounded to $153/m<sup>2</sup></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Therefore, relying on this comparable, we estimate the unit rate for the land of the TOA or the Lots for open storage use to be $153/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Tribunalâs Determination of the OMR for the Lots for the period of temporary occupation by the Respondent</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> We have valued the <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Omr</span> of the TOA and the non-TOA (where appropriate) of the Lots in Table 4 below.

As we have explained before, we do not find AWâs ScenarioI, i.e. with structure portion or house use and open storage and workshop use to be a feasible scenario in the real world as no onewould like to pay for such rent for a house which is surrounded by some flat and sloping land that are being used, as suggested byAW, for open storage and workshop use.  Therefore, we only need to consider in details the 2 feasible scenarios of uses of the Lots. That is, since we are of the view that the Lots could either be used for (1) a mix of house use for the structure portion plus gardenuse for the land portion or (2) a mix of covered storage and workshop for the house portion plus open storage for the land portion,the higher of the two estimated values in Table 4 represents the OMR of the <span style="text-transform: uppercase">toa</span> or the Lots.

discussed before in the section on the area of the TOA and the Lots, we find that the TOA covers all the area of the Lots withthe exception of the back slope.  Therefore, as set out in Table 2 above, we find that AW has included the entire non-TOA (i.e. backslope) in both his Scenarios 1 and 2.  AW opined that even though the Respondent chose to omit the non-TOA of the Lots (i.e. theback slope) in G.N. 4520 for the temporary occupation period, it would not be possible for the Applicant to make use of the non-TOAslope as the Applicant was denied access during the said period of occupation.  On the other hand, RW contended that the Applicantwas only entitled to what was stated in the G.N. 4520, as stipulated by the provisions of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> RW opined that under AWâs Scenario I (in which the land portion was assumed to be put to open storage and workshop use), the slopingland, whether within the TOA (i.e. the front slope) or within the non-TOA (i.e. the back slope), could not be put to such uses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In AWâs Scenario II (which is the same as RWâs Scenario I) under which it was assumed that the structure was put to house useand the land was put to garden use, AW assessed the entire slope (both within and outside TOA) at the same unit rate as for gardenuse on flat land whilst RW only assessed the TOA portion at 1/4 of the unit rate for garden use on flat land.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>   Having regard to all these evidence and arguments, we find that the Applicant should be compensated for the non-TOA as damagesif the basis was for garden use.  However, we decide that we agree with RW that there is no market for open storage and workshopuse for all the sloping land in his Scenario I.  But we agree with RW that the non-TOA, by virtue of the topography could only atbest fetch 1/4 of the value as for flat land, even if the use is for garden use.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether the Applicant is entitled to claim the loss of rent for the period prior to the relevant G.N. 4520 for the temporary occupationof the TOA</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> The Applicant contended that the basis of the Applicantâs claim for the loss of rent prior to the creation of the right of temporaryoccupation of the TOA was Item 2(b) of column two under Part II of the Schedule to the Ordinance.  G.N. 4520 stated that the Respondentwould be allowed to temporarily occupy the TOA for the purposes of or incidental to the works or use described in the Scheme of RoadProject described thereof, which included the various schemes of works referred to in G.N. Nos. 3309, 2874, 3565 and 4746. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> However, it does not follow that the Applicant is entitled to claim for the loss of rent from the date of the first such G.N. (i.e.G.N. 3309).  Firstly, the provisions of the Ordinance and G.N. 4520, which authorized the temporary occupation, did not explicitlyallowed for such entitlement of claim.  Secondly, according to the evidence of Mr. Daniel Kwan, a director of the Applicant, theproperty had been let out at one stage for 2 or 3 years but this use had been abandoned not because of the Temporary Occupation ofthe TOA.  Thirdly, there was evidence, again from Mr. Kwan, that the Applicant had all along intended either to sell or to redevelopthe property.  Finally, although Mr. Kwan gave evidence claiming that after he knew of the Scheme dating back to the first noticeof G.N. 3309, it was not possible to rent out the property because the Respondent said that the original access linking the propertywith Castle Peak Road would be blocked.  However, we do not accept this piece of evidence since as an experienced architect Mr. Kwanshould have known that any road scheme published by the Respondent might take a long time to materialize or that any road schememight not be approved at all.  It does not make sense to us at all that Mr. Kwan felt compelled to stop renting out the propertyas soon as he first noticed G.N. 3309, which first notified the general public, the Scheme, or variations of the Scheme before thefinal Scheme as that shown in G.N. 4520.  For this reason, we decide not to accept AWâs contention to extend the period of claimfor loss of rent to the date of first gazetting of G.N. 3309 (i.e. 10 July 1998), about 3.3 years before the date of creation ofthe rights of temporary occupation (i.e. 27 October 2001).   </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The Applicant failed to discharge the onus of proof that the element of causation existed between the first date of notice of thefirst G.N.; G. N. 3309 and the cessations of use of the Lots for storage or other permitted uses.  Therefore, the Applicant did notsatisfy the test for the award of damage under Item 2(b) of Part II of the Schedule to the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether the Applicant is entitled to claim for the loss of rent for the period that is needed for the reinstatement of the house onthe lots</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> There was no dispute from the Applicant that the Applicant knew that the house would be demolished by the Highway Departmentâscontractors who temporarily occupied the TOA under the scheme permitted by G.N. 4520 dated 26 July 2001.  This was needed since thesite level of the TOA had to be lowered to 2 levels (i.e. +43.5m P.D. and +34.5 m P.D.). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> However, the Applicant contended that since the Respondent confirmed that there was no issue of any legal waiver of entitlement onthe part of the Applicant, the Applicant was entitled to compensation for (1) the cost of reinstatement of the house and (2) therent that could not be received by the Applicant during the construction period of reinstating the house on the Lots.  The basisof the Applicantâs claims for these 2 items of claims were respectively based on Item 6(a) and 2(b) of column two under Part IIof the Schedule to the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Also, the Applicant contended that they were entitled to compensation assessed under the general compensation principle of ânobetter and no worseâ, akin to the compensation for the resumption of land by the Respondent.  Counsel for the Applicant cited thewell-established principle enunciated by the Judgment of <i>Shun Fung</i> case in support of his contention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> We agree with the Respondent that it would be wrong to award compensation for loss of rent for this ânotionalâ period of time. Firstly, it was not in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance, in particular the items listed out in Schedule II to theOrdinance.  Secondly, if it was the Applicantâs case that compensation for loss of rent for this ânotionalâ period was neededbecause this formed part of the disturbance payment due to the Applicant, it should better be taken care of by the âfall-backâapproach of RW.  This will be discussed in the section below. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Tribunalâs assessment of the total compensation for the loss of rent</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> As set out in the computations in Table 4 above, we have estimated the OMR of the Lots at $262,000 p.a.  Also, after detailed consideration,we have also decided that the only relevant period for the assessment of compensation payable to the Applicant, for the loss of rentdue to the temporary occupation by the Respondent of the TOA considered, is the period between (1) the date of creation of the rightsof temporary occupation (i.e. 27 October 2001) and (2) the date of handover of the site to the Applicant (i.e. 6 July 2004).

Also, apart from the disputes on whether the Applicant is legally entitled to the compensation for the additionalcosts for piling for building development to avoid loading on the bored pile retaining wall No. BPRW 37 and the additional costsof constructing the outstanding section of Road R3, the parties consented on the quantum of these costs, at $5,536,046 and $199,680respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> We agree with RW that her âfall backâ approach, if properly done, should have taken care of all the disturbance to the ApplicantâsTOA as well as all the disturbance to the Applicantâs non-TOA of the Lots.  We agree with RW that, what the Respondent has suffered,as a result of the Respondent being allowed (by virtue of the G.N. 4520 giving the Respondent rights of temporary occupation of theTOA) to occupy the TOA for the period from 27 October 2001 to 6 July 2004, should best be calculated by reference to the differencein the Open Market Value (âOMVâ) of the Lots as at the date of handing over of the TOA to the Applicant on 2 bases, assuming(a) no rights of temporary occupation has been given to the Respondent and (i.e. âBeforeâ Value) (b) rights of temporary occupationhas been given and actually enjoyed by the Respondent (i.e. âAfterâ Value). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Both parties agreed that in the absence of suitable direct sale site comparables, the only method of valuing the OMV of the Lotsin the âBeforeâ and âAfterâ situation is the Residual Method which, as we understand, has also been commonly employed bythe valuation profession.  In the Residual Method of Valuation, the estimated OMV of the Lots, being a site ripe for development,at a certain point of time should have already reflected the delay in development, if any, that might have been caused by the temporaryoccupation of the TOA by the Respondent. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> AW argued that, regardless of the intention of the Applicant, the Applicant was still entitled to claim for the damage done to theApplicantâs property in the form of (a) reinstatement cost of the house structure, and (b) delay to the development envisaged bythe Applicant.  We do not agree with this contention and AWâs reasoning.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mr. Kwan gave evidence that since purchase in 1994, the Applicant never actually renovated the house for renting out as a house andgarden.  In 1998, the Applicant applied to redevelop the Lots into 2 blocks of 6 to 7 storey service apartments but was rejected. Notwithstanding this rejection, the Applicant was still contemplating redevelopment, including exploring the possibility of havinga land exchange with the Respondent.  The Applicant confirmed its continuing intention of redevelopment during the years when theRespondent consulted the general public and the owners of affected land (including the Applicant) on the Scheme, which were reviseda number of times.  From the agreed minutes of meetings held during this period and the evidence of Mr. Kwan, the Applicant indicatedvery clearly that one of the main reasons for agreeing the temporary occupation of the TOA was that they would not like a differentscheme which might trigger resumption of a much larger area of the Lots and which would also delay their development proposal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> During these years, the Town Planning Board was in the course of amending the zoning for the Lots and some other land in the vicinity,by relaxing the maximum permissible plot ratio from 0.4 (at the time of 27 October 2001 when G.N. 4520 was published) to 1.2.  Therewere much consultation and amendments relating to this relaxation of density control.  Eventually, the Town Planning Board agreedon 14 March 2003 that the proposed amendment of plot ratio should form part of the draft OZP No. S/TWW/13.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Therefore, based on the facts of this case including the evidence of Mr. Kwan, a director of the Applicant who was involved withthe planning for the redevelopment of the Lots from the beginning of their purchase by the Applicant in 1994 to the present day,as well as the valuations prepared by AW and RW, we have no doubt to conclude that the highest and best use of the Lots, both beforeand after the temporary occupation, was as a development site.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> So, in short, using the valuation professionâs jargon, a âBeforeâ and âAfterâ valuation of the Applicantâs property,including the TOA and adjoining non-TOA of the Lots at the relevant date, if properly done using the correct assumptions and parameters,would sum up all the disturbance that should be payable to the Applicant.  This disturbance payment would already reflect all theexpenditure in the nature of extra engineering and building costs due to the change in the physical level, soil and ground conditionof the TOA and the non-TOA of the Lots.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Using compensation for resumption of a portion of land as an analogy, it does not make sense that a claimant whose land was compulsorilyresumed by the Respondent should be compensated for both (a) the diminution in development value of his land due to resumption (i.e.valuation made on development site value basis) and (b) the diminution in existing use value of his land and existing structure thereon.(i.e. valuation made on existing use value basis).  Normally, the aggrieved claimant would be compensated for the higher of the twovaluations.  Hence, we do not agree with the approach of RW to compute the disturbance to the Applicantâs property by adding upall the items (e), (f), (g) and (h) as set out in his valuation report and summarized in Table 1 above.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Finally, since the purpose of assessment of the OMV of the Lots was to ascertain the disturbance effects, if any, that were due tothe temporary occupation of the TOA by the Respondent, it would be reasonable if we take the date of handing over of the TOA to theApplicant as the relevant valuation date. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Assessments of the effects on the OMV of the Lots by AW and RW</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> As discussed in the previous section, we do not agree with the approach of AW to claim for the disturbance payment in the natureof âloss due to the delay in developmentâ caused by the requirement to carry out additional engineering works in the actual (orâAfterâ situation) when the Respondent handed back the TOA to the Applicant.  AW set out his estimate and conclusion in his SecondFurther Supplementary Valuation Report dated 23 November 2005.  He revised 2 residual valuations previously prepared by his predecessorconsultant, Mr. Charles C P Lai who used to estimate the claim on behalf of the Applicant.  On this approach, AW estimated the âBeforeâand the âAfterâ Values of the Lots, as at 27 October 2001, in the sums of $41,217,373 and $39,391,369 respectively.  These showa difference of $1,826,004.  AW claimed this sum as the Applicantâs loss due to the delay in development of the Lots.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In both the âBeforeâ and âAfterâ valuations, AW assumed the optimum development of 25 NTEHs with a total GFA of 3,123 m<sup>2</sup>.  All the inputs in both valuations were the same, the only difference being the additional period of 2.5 years in the âAfterâsituation, as against the shorter period of 2.0 years in the âBeforeâ situation.  Also, we note that contrary to what Mr. Laidid in the âAfterâ situation (at which time Mr. Lai estimated an extra site formation cost due to slope cutting of $1,000,000)AW did not see fit to add the additional cost (i.e. extra foundation and site formation costs) even though AW already had the benefitof the agreed extra cost of $5,536,046.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> We understand AWâs rationale.  He thought that it would be more reasonable to claim the additional extra foundation and site formationcost as one of the separate items of claim under the general heading of âdisturbanceâ as a consequence of temporary occupationof the TOA by the Respondent.  Therefore, he did not include this additional cost in his âAfterâ valuation to avoid double counting.However, in RWâs computations, this item of delay in development of the Lots should have been taken into account by reference tothe difference between the OMV of the Lots assessed under the âBeforeâ and âAfterâ situation.  After considering both approaches,we have no doubt that AWâs approach was wrong because RWâs valuation approach was correct in principle.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> RWâs latest assessment of the âBeforeâ and âAfterâ Values are set out in her Further Supplementary Report dated 24 November2005.  She estimated the âBeforeâ Values to be $40,109,748 and $38,099,846 respectively, giving a difference of $2,009,902. She rounded off this figure to $2,010,000, which was accepted by her as the compensation payable to the Applicant for all the disturbancecaused to the Applicant, other than the compensation for the loss of rent in respect of the actual period of occupation of the TOA.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> There is much in common in the basic approach in

the following: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) We find that we should assume a development to a plot ratio of 1.2 since the Lots had already been re-zoned to R(C)2 on 8 July2003 before the valuation date of 6 July 2004.  It is noted that for this revised zoning, the Lots could be developed to a maximumplot ratio of 1.2.  Since we adopt RWâs date of valuation as well as the type of development, we obviously should use the assessedunit gross development value and unit cost of TW.  On the other hand, AWâs valuations assume BTEH (New Territories Exempted House). This assumption is not applicable in AWâs latest proposal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) For the development periods in both situations, we must take into account the larger scale of development than what RW assumed. Also, we find and agree with the Applicant that it would take more time to undergo the development in the âAfterâ situationwhen the Applicant has to carry out additional foundation and site formation works in the tune of over $5.5 million, or about anadditional 14% of construction costs in the âBeforeâ situation (based on our estimate).  In the circumstances, we consider itreasonable to assume a period of 2 years in the âBeforeâ situation and an additional period of 3 months in the âAfterâ situation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) In calculating the present values of the costs of development in the valuations, we have taken into account the figures used byAW as well as what the Tribunal adopted in the resumption case of LDMR14 of 2002.  We agree to take, on average, more than half ofthe overall period of development in arriving at the present value of the costs of development.  We decide to adopt figures of 1.25years and 1.5 years in the respective âBeforeâ and âAfterâ situations.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) For the site formation cost in the âBeforeâ situation, we agree to adopt RWâs estimate, which is based on 10% of RWâsestimated building cost.  However, in the âAfterâ situation, whilst we agree in principle with RW to add the agreed additionalpiling and site formation cost for building development on the lower platform, we do not agree with her that this agreed additionalcost already covers the site formation cost which is therefore deleted in RWâs valuation.  However, we have checked the cost estimateproduced by the Applicantâs consultant (at p.393 of Exhibit AR-2), we find that the agreed additional cost is the <u>extra</u> cost for the piling and foundation works.  No expert on construction or engineering was called to support of either partyâs contention. Also, we agree with the Applicant that by the time of our adopted date of valuation (6 July 2004, the date of hand over of the siteto the Applicant), the site had been rezoned to R(C), which permits a maximum plot ratio of 1.2.  Therefore, the agreed additionalcost, based on the Applicantâs latest development proposal obviously also assumes a plot ratio of 1.2.  Hence, we find that thefull amount of the agreed additional cost of piling and site formation works in the sum of $5,536,046, in addition to the RWâsadopted site formation cost (representing 10% of RWâs estimated building cost) should be adopted in the âAfterâ situation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) For the developerâs profit, we decide to adopt the 20% figure both used by the Tribunal in the Judgment of LDMR 14 of 2002 andthe AWâs valuations.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Based on the difference of our two residual valuations for the âBeforeâ and âAfterâ situations, we estimate the differencein the OMV of the Lots as at 6 July, 2004 (i.e. at the date of its hand over to the Applicant by the Respondent) in the sum of $6,305,310. As explained before, we are of the opinion that this represents the total amount of disturbance due to the temporary occupationof the TOA of the Lots, other than the loss of rent to the Applicant due to the said temporary occupation.  Hence, this also representsthe total amount of compensation payable by the Respondent to the Applicant in respect of the disturbance.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Therefore, we also dismiss all the claims by the Applicant for the various items of disturbance as set out in an earlier sectionof this Judgment, with the exception for the construction of outstanding section of road R3, which we will discuss below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Construction of outstanding section of road R3</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The Applicant submitted that before the temporary occupation of the Lots by the Respondent, there was an existing access road linkingthe Lots with Castle Peak Road and the Respondent had also agreed to re-provide Road 3 after the completion of improvement worksof Castle Peak Road.  However, the contractors of the Highways Department terminated the construction of the re-provisioned accessroad about 16 metres away from the site boundary of the Lots.  The additional costs of this stretch of road was estimated by theApplicantâs consultant Mr. Koo at $199,680 the quantum of which was also accepted by the Respondent subject to the Tribunalâsdetermination on the issue of entitlement.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The Respondent submitted that this item of roadwork was unconnected with the temporary occupation.  As such, there should be no basisfor the claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> However, we find that it is not disputed that before the temporary occupation of the TOA, there was the said access road linkingthe Lots with Castle Peak Road.  The re-provisioning of the access road was definitely part of the Road Project Scheme covered byG.N. 4520, which provided the Respondent the basis for the temporary occupation of the TOA.  In the last section, we have consideredthe damage done to the Lots, apart from the issue of loss of rent by reference to the difference in the OMV of the Lots in the âBeforeâand âAfterâ situations.  However, since the assessment of the OMV of the Lots in both situations must assume the existence ofan access road leading to the Lots.  In the âBeforeâ situation, there was no dispute that an access road existed whilst in theâAfterâ situation, there was also no dispute that the re-provisioned access road was some 15 m away from the boundary of theLots.  Since we have not made allowance for the absence of 15 m of re-provisioned road in our âAfterâ situation, we think itis appropriate that the Applicant should be compensated for this item on the basis of the agreed estimated cost of $199,680.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Summary of compensation for the Applicant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> In summary, the compensation payable to the Applicant are estimated to be the sum of the following:</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">Loss of rent</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="54%">(estimated as at the date of 27 October 2001) </td>            <td width="46%">$686,100</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">Disturbance payment-</td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">(i) Based on the difference of âBeforeâ and âAfterâ</td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">   Value of the Lots after the hand over on 6 July 2004</td>            <td width="46%">$6,305,310</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">(ii) Construction of outstanding section of road R3</td>            <td width="46%">$199,680</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">                <p align="left">Total</p>            </td>            <td width="46%"><u>$7,191,090</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%"> </td>            <td width="46%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="54%">Rounded to</td>            <td width="46%">$7,191,100</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Orders</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Accordingly, we order that the Respondent do pay the Applicant compensation for the temporary occupation of TOA over the Lots, includingcompensation for the loss of rent and disturbance payment, in the sum of $7,191,100.
