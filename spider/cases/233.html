It did so on two grounds. The first was that an exclusive jurisdictionclause required the dispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendant to be determined in the courts of the mainland. The second wasthat the Guangzhou Maritime Court in the Province of Guangdong was the more appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute thanthe High Court of Hong Kong. Stone J declined to stay the proceedings, and the Defendant now appeals. There is no appeal from thejudge's conclusion relating to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. It is only his ruling on the issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em> which is challenged.</p>    <p class="heading">The dispute</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff's case is that it contracted to purchase a cargo of yellow phosphorus from Hunan Leadar International Trade Corporation("the sellers"). The sellers are based in the Province of Hunan. The cargo was to be shipped to Bombay in India. Payment under thecontract was to be made by irrevocable letters of credit, and the Plaintiff opened a letter of credit with the Bombay branch of theStandard Chartered Bank ("the issuing bank") in favour of the sellers for that purpose.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The letter of credit was a negotiation credit. It was negotiated by the Changsha branch of the Agricultural Bank of China ("the negotiatingbank") by discounting two bills of exchange drawn on the issuing bank. Changsha is in the Province of Hunan. The negotiating bankin turn sought reimbursement from the issuing bank's branch in New York pursuant to the inter-bank engagement contained in the letterof credit, and the Plaintiff's account with the issuing bank's branch in Bombay was debited with that amount.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Among the documents tendered by the sellers in order to obtain payment under the letter of credit were what purported to be two billsof lading. They purported to have been issued by the Defendant in Huangpu. Huangpu is a port in the Province of Guangdong, and the"bills of lading" purported to record that the cargo had been shipped from there. In fact, the cargo had not been shipped from Huangpuat all.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> None of these facts are disputed by the Defendant. Its case is that it did not issue the "bills of lading" at all. It claims thatan employee of its agent in Changsha, without his employers' or the Defendant's authority, provided the sellers with blank bill oflading forms, both of which were stamped with the Defendant's chop, and one of which bore a signature. It was the sellers who completedthe details on the bill of lading forms, and then used the forms to obtain payment under the letter of credit.</p>    <p class="heading">The applicable principles</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The applicable principles for determining an application for a stay on the ground of forum non conveniens are well-known, but inview of the particular submissions which have been developed on this appeal, it is useful to remind ourselves of what they are. Themodern law is contained in the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in <strong>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460.</a> At p. 476B-C, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that thereis some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. inwhich the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">But this basic principle, concluded Lord Goff, had to be modified to reflect the plaintiff's right to sue in a particular jurisdiction.He posed this question at p. 476F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The question being whether there is some other forum which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, it is pertinentto ask whether the fact that the plaintiff has, ex hypothesi, founded jurisdiction as of right in accordance with the law of thiscountry, of itself gives the plaintiff an advantage in the sense that the English court will not likely disturb jurisdiction so established."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Having considered authorities in various jurisdictions, including federal ones, Lord Goff concluded at p. 477D-E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"In my opinion, the burden resting on the defendant is not just to show that England is not the natural or appropriate forum for thetrial, but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Lord Goff then considered the factors to be taken into account in determining that question. At pp. 477F-478B, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Since the question is whether there exists some other forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the courtwill look first to see what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum .... I respectfully consider that itmay be more desirable .... [to refer] to the 'natural forum' as being 'that with which the action had the most real and substantialconnection.' So it is for connecting factors in this sense that the court must first look; and these will include not only factorsaffecting convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses), but also other factors such as the law governing the relevanttransaction .... and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Lord Goff concluded by addressing the question of what the consequences of that inquiry should be. At p. 478B-D, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"If the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of theaction, it will ordinarily refuse a stay .... It is difficult to imagine circumstances where, in such a case, a stay may be granted.... If however the court concludes at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriatefor the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires thata stay should nevertheless not be granted. In this inquiry, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, includingcircumstances which go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions. One such factorcan be the fact, if established objectively by cogent evidence, that the plaintiff will not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction... [O]n this inquiry, the burden of proof shifts to the plaintiff."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Lord Goff's speech in <strong>Spiliada</strong> was considered by the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong in <strong>"The Adhiguna Meranti"</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904.</a> In giving the judgment of the court, Hunter JA said at pp. 907E-908A that as a result of Lord Goff's speech in <strong>Spiliada</strong>,</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">".... [t]he court has now to answer a single question namely: 'Is there some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction,which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests ofall the parties and the ends of justice' (p. 476B). Although this may no longer be necessary, .... we still think it convenient forthe purposes of analysis to view the problem at three separate stages namely:</p>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(I)</td>                    <td width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">Is it shown that Hong Kong is not only not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but that there is another available forumwhich is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong (p. 477I).

The court must try tobe objective (p. 482D). Proof of this, which can fairly be called the ultimate burden of persuasion, rests upon the applicant forthe stay. By these means he establishes that on balance the other forum is more suitable 'for the interests of all the parties andthe ends of justice'. This may be another way of saying that the plaintiffs' choice of forum has been shown to be so inappropriateas to deserve the pejorative description of 'forum-shopping' and to be restrained accordingly ...."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </div>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">(The page nos. of the citations from <strong>Spiliada</strong> which Hunter JA gave were from the page nos. of the report of the case in the Weekly Law Reports.

It is said that his conclusion was that the Defendant had failed to discharge the burden imposed on it at stage I of the analysis.That conclusion is said to be wrong.

Mr Sussex contended that such juridical disadvantagesas the Plaintiff would be subject to if the case proceeded in the Guangzhou Maritime Court were minimal, and it could not be saidthat substantial justice would not be done there.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> With one crucial exception, Mr Clifford Smith for the Plaintiff agreed with that analysis. He agreed that the judge's conclusionhad been that the Defendant had failed to discharge the burden imposed on it at stage I of the analysis. Accordingly, the judge didnot go on to consider stages II and III. Mr Smith also agreed that such juridical disadvantages as the Plaintiff would encounterif its claim proceeded in the Guangzhou Maritime Court were not such as to justify denying the Defendant the right to have the caseheard there which, ex hypothesi, would clearly or distinctly be the more appropriate available forum. The critical point at issue,therefore, was the judge's conclusion at stage I of the analysis. Was the judge right to conclude that the Defendant had failed todischarge the burden on it to show that the Guangzhou Maritime Court was clearly or distinctly more appropriate for the trial ofthe action than the courts of Hong Kong?</p>    <p class="heading">The substance of the judge's decision</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Before addressing that question, I wish to comment on whether the judge had indeed decided the issue of a stay against the Defendantat stage I of the analysis. The judge concluded his judgment in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">".... on the evidence before me I decline, in the exercise of my discretion, to hold that the Guangzhou Maritime Court is 'clearlyor distinctly more appropriate' than the Hong Kong forum for the trial of the action, or that in the circumstances it would be justfor such a stay to be ordered."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">That is the language of a decision at stage I of the analysis and is the basis on which I go along with what is common ground betweencounsel. What made me initially hesitate before I did so were two things:</p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top">(i)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top">The words which the judge added at the end of the passage - that the judge declined to hold that "in the circumstances it would bejust for such a stay to be ordered" - suggested that the judge had been engaged in an exercise other than simply the analysis atstage I. On balance, though, I think that the judge must have had in mind that a failure by a defendant to discharge the burden atstage I of the analysis will "ordinarily" result in the refusal of the stay, and will "normally" be fatal to its application. Thejudge was therefore saying that there were no exceptional circumstances which might justify a decision adverse to the Defendant atstage I not being fatal to the application.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="95%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top">(ii)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top">The judge introduced his conclusion with the words "in the exercise of my discretion". I shall address in a moment whether the analysisat stage I involves the exercise of a discretion. But even if it does not, I think that the judge used the expression because hethought that the analysis at stage I involved the exercise of a discretion, rather than because he was at stage III of the analysiswhich undoubtedly would have involved the exercise of a discretion.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p class="heading">The attack on the judge's conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> <em>Exercise of discretion.</em> Mr Sussex contended that the analysis at stage I did not involve the exercise of a discretion. It was a question of mixed fact andlaw on which there could only be one correct answer. If the Court of Appeal concludes that the answer which the judge arrived atwas not the correct answer, it has to substitute what it considers the correct answer to be for the answer given by the judge.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I cannot go along with this argument in its entirety. Even if stage I of the analysis does not involve the exercise of a discretion,it involves the making of a value judgment based on its assessment of all the factors which connected the action to one forum andthose factors which connected it to another. The process by which that value judgment is formed is akin to the exercise of a discretion.It follows that, if the Court of Appeal is to interfere with the judge's conclusion, it would not be sufficient if the court wouldhave reached a different view from that of the judge. It would be necessary for the court to conclude that the judge's conclusionwas outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> <em>As of right.</em> However, the Court of Appeal would be entitled to interfere with the judge's conclusion, and to decide the issue for itself, if thejudge had reached his conclusion in disregard of principle. Mr Sussex was contending, I think, that in one respect the judge disregardedprinciple, namely by attaching too much weight to the fact that the Plaintiff had a right to bring the proceedings in Hong Kong.No, or at any rate little, weight should be attached to that factor, argued Mr Sussex, because that factor has already been builtinto the test to be applied: see the passage in Lord Goff's speech in which the basic principle was modified to reflect the plaintiff'sright to sue in a particular jurisdiction (pp. 476F-477F).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Although I see the force of that argument, it must not be taken too far. Lord Goff himself recognised that distinctions can be drawneven between plaintiffs who have the right to sue in a particular jurisdiction. Lord Goff gave the example at p. 477F of the casewhere "the connection of the defendant with the English forum is a fragile one (for example, if he is served with proceedings duringa short visit to this country)." That is to be contrasted with corporate defendants, such as the defendant in the present case, whoare incorporated in Hong Kong and who hold themselves out as doing business in Hong Kong. In such cases, it is not inconsistent withLord Goff's statement of principle for the court to give modest weighting to the plaintiff's right to sue in Hong Kong. To applywhat Lord Goff said to the Hong Kong context, the more fragile the defendant's connection with Hong Kong, the easier it should befor the defendant to prove that there is another clearly more appropriate forum for the trial than Hong Kong.

[p]roceedings begun in Hong Kong as of right are not lightly disturbed, a principle epitomised by the burden imposed upon aparty making an application for a stay purely on the forum non conveniens basis ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">he should not be treated, I think, as giving impermissible weight to the Plaintiff's right to sue in Hong Kong. Rather, he shouldbe regarded as simply giving legitimate effect to the particular circumstances in which the Plaintiff's right to sue in Hong Konghad arisen.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> <em>The critical question.</em> With these considerations in mind, I turn to the critical question: was the judge's conclusion that the Defendant had failed to establishthat the Guangzhou Maritime Court was clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action than the courtsof Hong Kong a conclusion which was outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible? I bear in mind thatthe case is one with transnational ingredients. As Mr Smith said, the case should not be treated as if it was a road traffic accidentin Guangzhou. It is a case in which documents which purported to be bills of lading bearing the address in Hong Kong of the companyincorporated in Hong Kong which purportedly issued them on the mainland were presented to a bank on the mainland with the ultimateintention of obtaining payment on a letter of credit which had been opened in India by a company incorporated in India in connectionwith a shipment of cargo from the mainland to India. With that in mind, I turn to the various connecting factors.</p>    <p align="justify">(i) <em>The place of the tort</em>. In <strong>"The Albaforth"</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 91</a>, Robert Goff LJ (as he then was) said at p. 96:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"If the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts coulddisplace the conclusion that the Courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In the present case, many of the material events, including the issue and presentation of the "bills of lading", took place in Changsha(a place for which, on the evidence, the Guangzhou Maritime Court had jurisdiction in maritime cases). But the torts which the Plaintiffalleges were committed were the torts of fraudulent misrepresentation (deceit), negligent misstatement and conspiracy to defraud.An essential ingredient of the first two is that the plaintiff has to have relied on the misrepresentation or the misstatement tohis detriment. To the extent that these causes of action are based on the <em>Plaintiff's</em> reliance on the statements contained in the documents which purported to be the bills of lading, that reliance took place in India.Thus, the acts which constituted two of the Plaintiff's causes of action occurred in more than one jurisdiction (neither of which,admittedly, is Hong Kong).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I have not overlooked Mr Sussex's point that it was the negotiating bank which acted in reliance on the statements contained in the"bills of lading". The issuing bank in turn paid the negotiating bank pursuant to the inter-bank engagement contained in the letterof credit. The Plaintiff paid the issuing bank pursuant to an independent engagement undertaken when it applied for the issue ofthe letter of credit. Thus, the reliance on the statements contained in the documents which purported to be the bills of lading wasthat of the negotiating bank on the mainland. On the other hand, the letter of credit had been opened on the Plaintiff's instructions,and payment under the letter of credit would not have been made (despite the independent engagement undertaken by it) if the Plaintiffhad known that the documents which purported to be the bills of lading (which they must have known had been tendered to the negotiatingbank) had contained false statements. It is therefore strongly arguable that the reliance on the statements contained in the documentswhich purported to be the bills of lading was that of the Plaintiff, and that therefore that reliance took place in India.</p>    <p align="justify">(ii) <em>The governing law.</em> Two assumptions can be made in favour of the Defendant: first, that the acts which constituted the torts occurred for the most parton the mainland; secondly, that the double actionability rule applies, i.e. that the acts complained of are actionable in Hong Kongonly if the acts complained of would be actionable (a) as a tort in Hong Kong and (b) according to the law of the mainland. The burdenbeing on the Defendant at this stage, it is noteworthy that there is no evidence that the acts complained of would not be actionableaccording to the laws of the mainland.</p>    <p align="justify">(iii) <em>The parties and the witnesses.</em> Neither of the parties carry on business on the mainland, although the Defendant has agents on the mainland. Indeed, as I have said,the Defendant is incorporated and carries on business in Hong Kong. I accept that the principal witnesses in the case are likelyto be the employee of the Defendant's agent in Changsha and the employees of the sellers and their agents, all of whom are presumablybased in Changsha. But there is still at least a possibility that one or more of the Plaintiff's employees in Bombay may have togive evidence as well as a representative of the Defendant, who is presumably based in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="justify">(iv) <em>The existing proceedings.</em> If a stay was to be granted, the judge plainly regarded the fact that proceedings had already been issued in the Guangzhou MaritimeCourt as the most significant factor in favour of a stay. Those proceedings had been commenced by the Defendant against the sellersand their agents in respect of the documents which purported to be the bills of lading, and the Guangzhou Maritime Court had acceptedjurisdiction to hear the case. Thus, it was argued before the judge that, if the current proceedings were stayed, the rights andliabilities of all the parties (not just the Plaintiff and the Defendant) could be decided by a court at the same time, thereby savingtime and expense and obviating the risk of inconsistent findings. On this issue, the judge was alive to "the presumption in favourof one-stop adjudication", but said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... in my view the Court reasonably could have expected substantially more information from the Defendant as to the existing Guangzhoulitigation, in particular as to the manner in which the present litigation between the Plaintiff and Defendant could be related toor assimilated with the current Guangzhou action, whether as part of those proceedings or as an action collateral thereto; and, ifthe latter, what provision could be made, for example, as to contemporaneous trial before the same judge (and assuming, for thispurpose, the absence of any jurisdictional difficulties). This seems to me to be important in the context of the present debate;inconsistency of judicial findings is not a problem arising solely in litigation in parallel jurisdictions, nor for that matter doesit seem entirely accurate to assert that the same issues arise for decision before the Hong Kong and Guangzhou courts, broad commonalityof background facts notwithstanding. In my view information of this nature is important in a situation in which, as here, the existenceand subject matter of related litigation is prayed in aid as an integral element in support of a <em>forum non conveniens</em> application, and I resist the notion that, absent appropriate evidence, the Court should accept an argument bearing within it theassumption that some appropriate form of 'consolidation' (if I may use the term loosely) can be effected within or in the contextof the current Guangzhou proceedings."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In short, one-stop adjudication would be a dead letter if the two sets of proceedings could not be consolidated and tried togetherby the same judge.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> At the end of the day, the judge was, as I have said, exercising a value judgment, weighing up a whole variety of different factors.I have spelt out those factors so that I could more easily assess whether the value judgment which the judge made was one which couldfairly be characterised as outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. I recognise that on the samematerial another judge may have come to a different conclusion. But not without some hesitation, I have concluded that the conclusionwhich Stone J reached was one which did not fall outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. I wouldtherefore dismiss the appeal. At present, I see no reason why costs should not follow the event, and the order nisi which I wouldmake is that the Defendant should pay to the Plaintiff its costs of the appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Godfrey VP :</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Unless a judge is satisfied, in this sort of case (a) that Hong Kong is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial and (b)that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong, he should, normally, exercisethe discretion he has to order or to refuse a stay of the proceedings in favour of refusing a stay.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> As I read his judgment in the present case, this was the principle on which Stone J acted here.
