In this sale and purchase, the vendors were Wong Kam MingSimon (çéæ) (âWongâ) and Leung Shui Hoi Sally (æ¢çé) (âLeungâ).  I shall refer to them collectively as âtheVendorsâ.  The sale was completed in April 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> In July 2001, the Plaintiff wanted to sell the Property.  She entered into a sale and purchase agreement with a prospective purchaserto sell the Property at $1,200,000.  The purchaser raised a number of requisitions on title, and the Plaintiff failed to answer oneof them satisfactorily.  The sale was aborted.  The Plaintiff took steps to rectify the blot on title, and managed to sell the Propertyin December 2001, but only at a diminished market price of $1,000,000. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> It is the Plaintiffâs contention that her failure to answer the requisition raised by the purchaser satisfactorily in 2001, resultingin the aborted sale and the consequential losses, was caused by the Defendants who had breached their contractual and/or tortuousduties owed towards her to exercise reasonable skill and care in completing the 1997 purchase.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Defendants</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> It is admitted by the Defendants that they were at the material times partners in a firm of solicitors practising in Hong Kong. Their partnership ceased in December 1997. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In the title of this action, the Plaintiff says that the Defendants were formerly trading in the name of âDaniel Wong <u>&amp; Co.</u>â, but the Defendants say that their former trade name was âDaniel Wong <u>&amp; Partners</u>â.  I am satisfied from the documents made contemporaneously with the relevant events and the statement of Mr. Wong Kwok Tung (âMr.Wongâ) that the Defendants were in fact trading under the name of âDaniel Wong &amp; Partnersâ at the material times.  Afterthe partnership had dissolved in December 1997, Mr. Wong continued his practice as a solicitor under the same firm name âDanielWong &amp; Partnersâ until September 2001 when the firm changed its name to âFan Wong &amp; Tsoâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Despite the inaccuracy in the description of the former trade name of the Defendantsâ firm, the 3 partners at the material timeshave been individually identified and collectively named as the Defendants in this action.  The description of their former tradename is otiose.  I find that the Defendantsâ liability, if any, will not be affected by this inaccurate description of their formertrade name.  In fact, no issue has been taken in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In this judgment, I shall refer to the Defendantsâ firm at the material times as Daniel Wong &amp; Partners (âDW&amp;Pâ).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Undisputed Facts</u></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff and Mr. Wong are the only witnesses who have testified in Court.  They adopt their respective written witness statementsas their evidence.  They elaborate their evidence by oral testimony.  Each of them is subject to cross-examination.  It is apparentthat there is little dispute over the facts of this case.  In addition, Mrs. Dora Chan, Counsel for the Plaintiff, and Mr. AlexanderStock, Counsel for the Defendants, have not taken any issue on the authenticity or admissibility of any document disclosed in thetrial bundles, and agree that the documents in the trial bundles can be used as evidence in this trial.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The following facts are either common ground in the evidence or are apparent from the documents admitted by the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>10. In or about February 1997, the Plaintiff through an estate agent Pricerite Realty Limited (âPriceriteâ) viewed the Property. Before viewing the Property, the Plaintiff had never met the Vendors.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> By a provisional sale and purchase agreement dated 12<sup>th</sup> February 1997, the Plaintiff agreed to buy and the Vendors agreed to sell the Property for a consideration of $2,520,000.  It wasstipulated in the agreement that the sale was to be completed on 16<sup>th</sup> April 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Plaintiff then retained DW&amp;P to act on her behalf to carry out all necessary work to complete the purchase, and to arrangefor the mortgage of the Property with HSBC.  The handling solicitor was Mr. Wong.  The Plaintiff left to DW&amp;P to handle everythingon her behalf relating to the purchase and the mortgage of the Property. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Meanwhile, another firm of solicitors, Messrs. John Ku, Tam &amp; Ho (âJKTHâ) represented the Vendors to complete the sale.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On or about 13<sup>th</sup> February 1997, Pricerite faxed to DW&amp;P a copy of the said provisional agreement and a copy of the Hong Kong Identity Cards ofthe Vendors.  The copy Identity Cards of the Vendors bore their respective names and identity card numbers.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> On 19<sup>th</sup> February 1997, JKTH sent to DW&amp;P a draft formal Agreement for Sale and Purchase of the Property for the Plaintiff to sign andfor DW&amp;P to attest to the execution.  On or about 1<sup>st</sup> March 1997, the Plaintiff signed the Agreement after she had been explained its contents by a staff of DW&amp;P.  Under the coverof a letter dated 1<sup>st</sup> March 1997, DW&amp;P returned the formal Agreement for Sale and Purchase to JKTH for the Vendors to sign and for JKTH to attest toits execution.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> On 4<sup>th</sup> March 1997, JKTH returned to DW&amp;P the formal Agreement for Sale and Purchase dated the same date after it had been signed bythe Vendors and attested by JKTH (âthe 1997 Agreementâ). </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In the 1997 Agreement, the names of the Vendors, both in English and Chinese, were stated.  Wong was identified by production ofhis Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [xxx] and Leung by production of her Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy]. Leung executed the Agreement by signing her name in Chinese.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Clause 5(a) of the 1997 Agreement stipulated <i>inter alia</i> that the Vendors should âprove a good title to the Propertyâ at their expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Under the cover of a letter dated 3<sup>rd</sup> April 1997, JKTH sent to DW&amp;P what they described as âthe title deeds and documents as per the Schedule annexed heretoâ forDW&amp;Pâs approval.   There were 20 items of deeds and documents listed in the Schedule, including a General Power of AttorneyMemorial No. 4562927 (âthe PAâ), and an Assignment Memorial No. 4562928 (âthe 1990 Assignmentâ).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The PA was dated 29<sup>th</sup> August 1990.  It was executed by Leung in favour of Wong, appointing Wong to be her attorney âin accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/31/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/31" class="autolink_findacts">Powers of Attorney Ordinance</a>, Chapter 21, Laws of Hong Kongâ.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Apparently, the reference to âChapter 21, Laws of Hong Kongâ in the PA was a mistake because Chapter 21 is the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>, and the proper chapter number for the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/31" class="autolink_findacts">Powers of Attorney Ordinance</a> is Chapter 31.  However, nothing turns on this mistake.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In the PA, the respective English and Chinese names of Leung and Wong were stated.  Leung was described as a âmarried womanâwith an address in Australia.  She described Wong as her husband whose address was a certain flat inside an industrial building inKwai Chung, Hong Kong.  Wong was described as the holder of a Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [xxx], whereas Leung wasidentified by the production of an Australian passport bearing the number [zzz].  Leung executed the PA by signing her English name. John Frederick Henry, a notary public in Melbourne, Australia, attested to the execution of the PA by Leung.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The 1990 Assignment was dated 7<sup>th</sup> September 1990 by which Wong and Leung purchased and acquired as joint tenants the legal estate of the Property that they eventuallysold or sought to sell to the Plaintiff in 1997.  Their predecessors-in-title were Lau Kam Kau and Lee Shui Chi.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As purchasers of the Property, Wong and Leung were identified by their respective names, in both English and Chinese, and their addresswas stated to be that of the Property.  Wong was the only person who had executed the 1990 Assignment.  He had signed twice, oncefor himself and the other as the lawful attorney of Leung, in the presence of Lam Alex Wai Kuen, solicitor.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Both the PA and the 1990 Assignment were registered in the Land Office on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 1990 under successive memorial numbers.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In response to the letter dated 3<sup>rd</sup> April 1997 from JKTH, DW&amp;P by a letter dated 11<sup>th</sup> April 1997 raised certain requisitions.  None of the requisitions related to the PA or the 1990 Assignment.  The requisitions wereanswered by JKTH in a letter dated 14<sup>th</sup> April 1997.  The documents requested by DW&amp;P were also supplied.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> On 16<sup>th</sup> April 1997, DW&amp;P sent to JKTH a draft assignment of the Property to be executed by the Vendors.  The draft assignment was approvedby JKTH and was executed by the Vendors (âthe 1997 Assignmentâ) whereby they assigned or sought to assign the legal estate ofthe Property to the Plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> In the 1997 Assignment, the respective English and Chinese names of the Vendors were stated.  The Vendors were said to have the sameaddress in a certain flat in Mei Foo Sun Chuen, whereas the address of the Property was stated to be the Plaintiffâs address. Wong was identified by production of his Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the same number [xxx] as that stated in the PA.  Leung wasidentified by production of her Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy].  It appeared from the 1997 Assignment that Wongsigned in a way similar to that in the 1990 Assignment, while Leung signed her Chinese name.  A legal executive Flora S.W. Li attestedto their execution of the assignment.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> On 16<sup>th</sup> April 1997, the Plaintiff attended the office of DW&amp;P as she had been so requested.  A female staff of DW&amp;P explained thecontents of the 1997 Assignment to her, and told her that all matters and papers were in order and that there was no problem withthe purchase of the Property.  The Plaintiff then signed on various documents including the 1997 Assignment and those for mortgagingthe Property.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The DW&amp;P had not informed the Plaintiff of, or drawn her attention to, the existence of the PA, or to any potential problem orquestion with the title of the Property before or after her execution of the 1997 Assignment.  Purchase of the Property was completed. The Plaintiff duly paid to DW&amp;P for their professional services.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> After completion of the purchase, the Plaintiff did not occupy the Property herself, but let it out to successive tenants to earnrentals.  The last tenant paid to her a monthly rent of $8,000 inclusive of Government rates and management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Under the cover of a letter dated 23<sup>rd</sup> May 1998 to HSBC that provided the mortgage loan to the Plaintiff to purchase the Property, DW&amp;P sent to HSBC âthe relevanttitle deeds and documentsâ relating to the Property for the latterâs safe custody.  The PA, the 1990 Assignment, the 1997 Agreementand the 1997 Assignment were included.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In 2001, the Plaintiff intended to sell the Property.  By a provisional sale and purchase agreement dated 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2001, she agreed to sell and one Miss Chan Yuet Ying (âChanâ) agreed to buy the Property at a price of $1,200,000 (âthe2001 Saleâ).</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The Plaintiff then instructed Messrs. Tsang &amp; Co. (âT&amp;Câ) whereas Chan instructed Messrs. Shea &amp; Co. (âS&amp;Câ)as their respective solicitors to carry out all necessary conveyancing work to complete the sale and purchase of the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> On or about 14<sup>th</sup> July 2001, the Plaintiff entered into a formal sale and purchase agreement with Chan for sale and purchase of the Property at $1,200,000with the completion date on or before 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2001 (âthe 2001 Agreementâ).  Chan paid a deposit of $120,000.  As the vendor, the Plaintiff was obliged by the agreementto prove good title and deliver vacant possession to Chan.  In anticipation of completing the sale, the Plaintiff vacated her tenantfrom the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>36. By a letter dated 28<sup>th</sup> July 2001, T&amp;C sent to S&amp;C âthe title deeds and documentsâ in respect of the Property, including the PA, the 1990 Assignment,the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> By a letter dated 30<sup>th</sup> July 2001, S&amp;C raised a number of requisitions.  Item 5 of the requisitions (âThe Requisitionâ) was relevant to the presentproceedings.  After referring to the PA, the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment in its caption, the Requisition read as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âLeung Shui Hoi Sally executed the captioned Power of Attorney by signing her name in English and she was at the time of executionof the said Deed identified by production of Australian Passport No. [zzz].  By the said Deed, she empowered her husband, Wong KamMing Simon to act as her Attorney to execute [the 1990 Assignment] by which they acquired the said property as joint tenants.  Inthe sale of the said property, she executed the captioned Agreement and Assignment by signing her name in both occasions in Chineseand she was then identified herself by production of Hong Kong Identity Card No. [yyy].  Please clarified and let us have the documentaryevidence to prove that the one âLeung Shui Hoi Sallyâ who executed the said Power of Attorney and holder of the said AustralianPassport and another âLeung Shui Hoi Sallyâ who executed the said Agreement and Assignment and holder of Hong Kong Identity CardNo. [yyy] was the one and the same person.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> S&amp;C had therefore identified the discrepancies between (1) the identification document, and (2) the signature of the donor ofthe PA and those of the 2<sup>nd</sup>-named vendor (i.e. Leung) in the 1997 Agreement and in the 1997 Assignment (âthe Discrepanciesâ).  S&amp;C alleged in effectthat these were material discrepancies that might affect the title of the Plaintiff to the Property because there were doubts asto the true identity of the Leung Shui Hoi Sally who executed the 1997 Assignment.  S&amp;C demanded the Plaintiff, through T&amp;C,to show that the two Leungs who executed the PA on the one hand and the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment on the other werein fact the one and the same person.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> On or about 30<sup>th</sup> July 2001, Mr. Andy Au, a solicitor of T&amp;C, informed the Plaintiff that there was a problem with the title of the Property byreason of the Requisition.  Prior to this point of time, the Plaintiff had never been informed of the Discrepancies by DW&amp;P.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> By a letter dated 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C asked DW&amp;P for a reply to the Requisition.  On 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C and S&amp;C agreed to postpone the completion to a date on or before 10<sup>th</sup> August 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> By a letter dated 6<sup>th</sup> August 2001, DW&amp;P replied as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe refer to your letter of 2/8/01.</p>        <p class="quote">While we consider that it is the duty of the vendorâs solicitors to deal with those requisitions, in particular, they relate togeneral principle of law, as a matter of courtesy, we comment as follows.</p>        <p class="quote">We consider that there is no doubt existed as to the identity of Leung Shui Hoi Sally in the [PA], [1997 Agreement] and [the 1997Assignment] based on the reasons below: -</p>        <p class="quote">a. Both the Chinese name and the English name of Leung Shui Hoi Sally (æ¢çé) in all three documents are the same;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">b.

It is clear from the Power of Attorney, the said Madam Leung signed her name âLeung Shui Hoiâ in English and the said MadamLeung signed her name âLeung Shui Hoiâ in Chinese in both Assignment and Agreement.

By a letter dated 9<sup>th</sup> August 2001, S&amp;C refused to accept that the Requisition had been satisfactorily answered, and demanded proof from the Plaintiffthat the two Leungs were the same person so as to prove good title to the Property.  Under the cover of a letter dated 9<sup>th</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C forwarded the reply from S&amp;C to DW&amp;P for further clarification.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Before DW&amp;P replied, T&amp;C had taken other actions in an attempt to confirm that the donor of the PA and the 2<sup>nd</sup> named vendor of the 1997 Assignment were in fact the same person.  By a letter dated 15<sup>th</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C asked Messrs. Y. L. Yeung &amp; Co. (âYLYâ) who acted for Wong and Leung when they purchased the Propertyin 1990, to seek clarification and assistance on the Requisition.  By another letter also dated 15<sup>th</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C wrote to the Australian Consulate General in Hong Kong seeking clarification as to whether the person identifiedby Australian Passport bearing the number [zzz] was the same person identified under Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy].</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> On or about 17<sup>th</sup> August 2001, S&amp;C served notice on T&amp;C that unless the Plaintiff could prove good title to the Property and answer the requisitionssatisfactorily and sufficiently on or before 31<sup>st</sup> August 2001, Chan would annul the purchase of the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> By a letter dated 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2001, YLY informed T&amp;C that they were not in a position to answer the Requisition because they had never met Leung andthe 1990 Assignment was signed by Leungâs lawful attorney.  YLY agreed that they had prepared the PA, but Leung had not executedthe PA before any of their solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> On or about 29<sup>th</sup> August 2001, T&amp;C was able to locate Leung who was then living in Australia.  Leung agreed to execute a statutory declarationto confirm that she was the same person who had executed the PA, the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The Plaintiff and Chan, through their respective solicitors, then agreed to postpone the completion further, firstly to 15<sup>th</sup> September 2001, and then to 17<sup>th</sup> September 2001, upon the condition that the Plaintiff could produce the requisite statutory declaration from Leung and prove goodtitle to the Property, failing which Chan would annul the sale.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> However, due to Leungâs delay in making the requisite statutory declaration, Chan through S&amp;C by a letter dated 18<sup>th</sup> September 2001 annulled the 2001 Sale and demanded for the return of deposits and payment of wasted expenses. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> By a letter dated 21<sup>st</sup> September 2001, Mr. Wong, who was then practising under the trade name of Fan Wong &amp; Tso, replied to the letter dated 9<sup>th</sup> August 2001 from S&amp;C.  He stated inter alia as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWithout prejudice to our position, which we reiterate, that it is the duty of the vendorâs solicitors to deal with any requisitionon title from his clientâs purchaser, particularly where the requisitions can satisfactorily be resolved by their own enquiriesand/or submissions on law, we would comment further (out of courtesy and goodwill only) as follows:</p>        <p class="quote">1. [The 1990 Assignment] was executed on behalf of the said Ms Leung Shui Hoi Sally, who was only the purchaser and assignee therein. It is trite law that execution of an assignment by the assignee is in fact not necessary.  Hence, it is not even necessary to provedue execution by the assignee in any circumstances.  As such, [the PA] is in fact <u>not</u> necessary for the purpose of proving title to the Property.  A fortiori, the said Power should not be taken into consideration atall when investigating title to the Property.  The manner of execution of the said Power by Ms Leung is therefore totally irrelevant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. Without prejudice to the foregoing observation and in any event, we respectfully maintain that there is no reasonable doubt onthe identity of Ms Leung as shown in the document in question.  No doubt can arise for the following reasons:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) The mere fact that a person is identified by different identification documents is not sufficient to give rise to a reasonabledoubt as to her identity.  It is not unusual for a person to be identified by her Australian passport and HK Identity Card respectively. This fact cannot be equated with doubt on her identity.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) Ms Leung signed in English as well as Chinese.  This is not a case of discrepancy in her signature.  She has merely used 2 differentsignatures.  Further, it can clearly be seen from both the English and Chinese signatures that she has in fact signed her name, i.e.âLeung Shui Hoiâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) On the other hand, there is ample evidence to show that the person signing the documents in question is indeed the same Ms Leung.</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) In all documents, Ms Leung has been referred to and identified by exactly the same name in both English and Chinese.  There existsno discrepancy whatsoever throughout.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) Her signatures in all the said documents have been properly attested.  There is no reason to doubt or question that the attestingwitnesses, including an Australian Notary Public, did not properly identify and satisfy themselves that the person signing was indeedMs Leung herself.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) Last but not the least, Ms Leung was a co-owner, holding the Property with her husband Mr. Wong.  There is less ground to suspectthat different persons signed the Power, the subsequent Agreement and Assignment, and that one of them was not Ms Leung.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">3. In the circumstances, no reasonable doubt on the identity of Ms Leung can arise.  If the purchaser insists that doubt does exist,we have to say that any such doubt without reason or justification, and is no more than a fanciful doubt that cannot have any realeffect on title to the Property.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> On or about 5<sup>th</sup> October 2001, the Plaintiff returned the deposit of $120,000 to Chan who duly executed a cancellation agreement dated 6<sup>th</sup> October 2001 for the sale and purchase of the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> About two months after the sale under the 2001 Agreement had been aborted, on or about 5<sup>th</sup> December 2001, T&amp;C obtained from Leung a statutory declaration confirming that she was the same person who executed the PA andthe 1997 Assignment, and that she was the holder of the Australian Passport bearing the numbers [zzz] referred to in the PA as wellas the holder of the Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the numbers [yyy] referred to in the 1997 Assignment. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Plaintiff paid $1,000 to Messrs.

He stated that the Requisitionwas not a proper, necessary and/or justified requisition on title, and that he therefore did not accept the Plaintiff had failedto answer to the requisition or she had failed to show good title to the Property.  He denied breach of any duty towards the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The vendor's obligation</u></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> With the benefit of hindsight, particularly after 5<sup>th</sup> December 2001 when Leung had confirmed in her statutory declaration that she was the holder of both Australian Passport bearing thenumber [zzz] and Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy] and that she was the same Leung who had executed both the PA andthe 1997 Assignment, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt the Vendors had given good title to the Property to the Plaintiffunder the 1997 Assignment.  It follows that the Plaintiff would have been in a position to give good title to the Property to Chanif the 2001 Sale had not been annulled.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> However, the fact that the Plaintiff had in fact a good title to convey was neither here nor there.  It is trite law that a vendorof a property must comply both with his duty to give title and to show title: <i>Active Keen Ltd. v Fok Chi Keong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20HKLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 HKLR 396</a>; <i>Kok Chong Ho v Double Value Developments Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20HKLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 HKLR 423.</a>  Le Pichon J. said in <i>Lord Energy Limited v Chen &amp; Another</i>, HCA A7124 of 1991, that: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt has to be borne in mind that at the requisitions stage, the obligation is upon the Vendors to show good title by satisfactorilyanswering requisitions irrespective of the Vendors' ability to pass good title on the date for completion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> It is not disputed that the Plaintiff was obliged by the 2001 Agreement to show good title at her expenses pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a>, Chapter 219.  The crucial point was therefore whether the Plaintiff had shown to Chan that she had a good title to the Propertythat could be conveyed to Chan before the 2001 Sale was annulled on 18<sup>th</sup> September 2001. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> A good title is one that is âwithout any blot, or possibility of litigation to the purchaserâ: <i>In re Stirrupâs Contract</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%201%20WLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 1 WLR 449</a>, that there is no âpatent cloud which could affect the title which was sought to be passedâ upon examination of the title documents:<i>Ma Chun-man v Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20HKLR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] HKLR 26</a>, and that it is a title that can âat all times and in all circumstances be forced upon an unwilling purchaser in an action forspecific performanceâ: <i>Kan Wing-yau &amp; Another v Hong Kong Housing Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 187.</a></p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> It is also trite law that the standard of proof that a vendor has to discharge when showing he has a good title to the Property isbeyond reasonable doubt: <strong><i>MEPC Ltd v.

Hence, it was incumbent upon the Plaintiffto prove beyond reasonable doubt to Chan, during the requisition stage, that the two Leungs were the one and the same person.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Propriety of the Requisition</u></p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> S&amp;C raised the Requisition and contended that the Plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient proof that the two Leungs were thesame person in light of the Discrepancies.  Apparently, T&amp;C agreed with S&amp;C.  Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P of course took a differentview.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> It is common ground in the evidence that the Defendants had never asked the Vendors to clarify or rectify the Discrepancies beforeor after the completion of the Plaintiffâs purchase under the 1997 Assignment.  According to the evidence given by Mr. Wong, itwas not because he had failed to notice the Discrepancies but because he found it wholly unnecessary and âstupidâ for him toraise such requisition with the Vendors since he considered that there was no reasonable doubt on the identity of Leung.  It is thereforethe defence case that the Requisition raised by S&amp;C in 2001 was not a proper, necessary or justified requisition on title thatshould never have been raised, and that when it was so raised, T&amp;C should have properly answered it and should not have advisedthe Plaintiff to cancel the 2001 Sale.  Mr. Stock submits that the wrong set of solicitors has been criticized in court.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> It is on the basis of the following two arguments that Mr. Stock submits that there was nothing in the Discrepancies, and that theydid not create even the remotest doubt as to the title that the Plaintiff had received under the 1997 Assignment: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The PA was simply not a document of title so that any alleged discrepancies between the PA and the 1997 Assignment were irrelevantto title.  On this basis, the Plaintiffâs claim is a complete non-starter (âthe primary defence argumentâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Even if the first argument were rejected, there was simply nothing inconsistent between the PA and the 1997 Assignment in thesense of a positive inconsistency that gave rise to any reasonable doubt that the Leung in the PA and the Leung in the 1997 Assignmentwere not the same person (âthe secondary defence argumentâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The primary defence argument</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Mr. Stock submits that the Plaintiffâs case is fundamentally flawed because it is trite law that in proving title, a power of attorneyunder which a purchaser has executed an assignment does not need to be produced because the assignment is effective without the signatureof the purchaser: <i>Lee Kim-ha v Yip Moon-chiu &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20HKDCLR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] HKDCLR 29</a>, <i>Choi Hung Investment Co. Ltd. v Chinco Investment Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20HKC%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 HKC 203</a>, <i>Lau Kwok Cheong Dinnes &amp; Another v Tse Ming Chiu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKC%20200" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKC 200</a>, and <i>Sihombing and Wilkinson</i>, <i>Hong Kong Conveyancing Law and Practice</i>, Issue 35, at paragraph VI [63].  Applying these authorities to the present case, Mr. Stock argues that since Wong had executed the1990 Assignment only as assignees for himself and on behalf of Leung pursuant to the power given by the PA, the title to the Propertypassed to Wong and Leung jointly irrespective of their execution of the 1990 Assignment, and the PA was therefore simply not partof the chain of title. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> On this basis, Mr. Stock submits that the PA was a document that was irrelevant to proving title, that it needed not be producedto prove title, and that it should justifiably be ignored by a solicitor examining title.  It is Mr. Stockâs contention that thePlaintiffs claim is fundamentally misconceived because it is based on alleged potential defects in title arising from matters containedin the PA which was irrelevant and needed not be produced and examined, and that for this reason, the Plaintiffâs claim fails <i>in limine</i>.  Mr. Stock regards his primary argument so strong that he terms it as his knock out point.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mrs. Chan does not argue that <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> and its line of authorities were wrongly decided, but submits that the principle enunciated in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> simply does not apply to the present case.  She distinguishes the present case from <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> on two bases.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> First, Mrs. Chan submits that the issue in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> was whether it was required to produce the power of attorney granted by the vendorsâ predecessor-in-title (Madam Lau) to her attorneyto complete the purchase when Madam Lau acquired the property herself for proof of title.  The issue in the present case howeveris on identity, i.e. whether the Leung who acquired the title of the Property jointly with Wong under the 1990 Assignment was thesame Leung who purported to assign the same title to the Plaintiff under the 1997 Assignment.  She stresses that in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>, the power of attorney executed by Madam Lau was not available and hence no similar discrepancies were found, but in the presentcase, the PA had in fact been sent to DW&amp;P and perused by Mr. Wong, and the Discrepancies cried out for clarification.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Mr. Stock argues that Mrs. Chan has not drawn a logical ground for distinction.  He submits that since it was not necessary for theVendors to produce the PA as a document of title and it was not necessary for the Plaintiff as the purchaser to examine the PA, itmust follow as a matter of logic that any issue of identity arising from the PA did not fall within the purview of DW&amp;Pâs dutiesof care in relation to title.  He stresses that the duty of the purchaserâs solicitor is simply to examine âthe documents oftitleâ in order to check for potential blots on title, and that the purchaserâs solicitor does not properly start looking atâextraneous materialsâ to try to investigate whether there might be any potential blots on title.  Mr. Stock relies particularlyupon <i>Choi Hung Investment Co. Ltd.</i> and stresses that while the issue of identity did arise in that case, the principle in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> was still held to be applicable.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Second, Mrs. Chan points out that in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>, the power of attorney had not been registered in the Land Registry, but the PA in the present case had.  Mrs. Chan submits thatonce the PA had been registered, it prima facie formed part of the title deeds and documents.  Mrs. Chan relies upon the decisionof the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Chen &amp; Another v Lord Energy Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 205.</a></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Mr. Stock submits that according to <i>Chen</i>, the fact that a document has been registered in the Land Registry merely gives rise to a presumption that it is a document of title,but this presumption is rebuttable.  He submits that the briefest glance at the 1990 Assignment will rebut the presumption becausethe PA was used for execution by the <i>assignees</i>.  He stresses that registration of a document in the Land Registry simply goes to priority but does not guarantee title, and doesnot affect the nature of the interest.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> In my view, in order to determine the validity or otherwise of the primary defence argument, two issues have to be considered. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> First, was the PA required for proving title to the Property had been properly vested in the Vendors (i.e. Wong and Leung) from whomthe Plaintiff derived her title under the 1997 Assignment? </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Second, even if the PA was not so required, was it justified for Mr. Wong to ignore and take no action in respect of the Discrepanciesthat were apparent when the PA, the 1990 Assignment and the 1997 Assignment were compared?</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In respect of the first issue, the primary document, or what Mr. Wong contends to be the only document, for proving that title tothe Property had been transferred to and vested in Wong and Leung was the 1990 Assignment.  To enable Wong and Leung to acquire thetitle, the 1990 Assignment had to perform two functions.  First, it had to identify the parties to the Assignment, i.e. Wong andLeung as the purchasers and their predecessors-in-title as the vendors (âthe identification functionâ).  If the 1990 Assignmentwas the <i>only</i> document to be used for proving transfer of title to the Property, the descriptions of Wong and Leung as stated within the four cornersof the Assignment had to be so sufficient and clear that they established beyond reasonable doubt the respective identities of Wongand Leung.  Second, the 1990 Assignment had to transfer the title to the Property from the predecessors-in-title to Wong and Leungby its due and proper execution (âthe transfer functionâ).</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> In so far as the identification of the parties was concerned, there were three parts in the 1990 Assignment that identified or soughtto identify the parties.  First, in the very first paragraph of the Assignment, the two predecessors-in-title of the one part, andWong and Leung of the other part were identified by their respective names, both in English and Chinese.  Leung was described asâLEUNG SHUI HOI SALLY (æ¢çé)â.  Second, immediately after the partiesâ names on the Assignment, they were identified bytheir respective addresses.  The address of the Property was put down as the address of both Wong and Leung.  Third, in the attestationclause at the end of the Assignment, the two predecessors-in-title and Wong were each identified by production of their respectiveHong Kong Identity Cards which carried their unique identity card numbers, and their identity card numbers were duly recorded inthe Assignment.  However, Leung was not identified by any identification document, be it her Hong Kong Identity Card or foreign passport. What was stated in the attestation clause concerning Leung was simply that: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED by the Purchasers the said Leung Shui Ho Sally by her lawful Attorney the said Wong Kam Ming Simon[Holder of Hong Kong Identity Card No. [xxx] in the presence of Lam Alex Wai Kuen, solicitor, Hong Kong.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> On the face of the 1990 Assignment, the purchasers to whom the title to the Property had been transferred were Wong and Leung. Withinthe Assignment itself, Wong had been identified not only by his name but also by his unique Hong Kong Identity Card number [xxx]. Hence, the 1990 Assignment had established beyond reasonable doubt the identity of Wong and performed its identification functionin so far as Wong was concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> In the case of Leung, the indicia of identity relating to Leung in the 1990 Assignment were that she was called âæ¢çéâ inChinese and âLeung Shui Hoi Sallyâ in English, that her address was that of the Property, and that her lawful attorney was Wongwhose identity had been established.  Having so described Leung, had the 1990 Assignment performed its identification function inso far as Leung was concerned?</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> In my view, these indicia of identity were just insufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt the identity of Leung.  It wasnot a rare occurrence for two or more Chinese persons to have identical names, not only in Chinese but also in English as well asin their Christian names.  Her address as stated in the Assignment was not helpful because it was the address of the Property thatwas due to be acquired by her with Wong under the Assignment but was not her address at that time.  The reference in the attestationclause that Leung executed the Assignment by her lawful Attorney Wong gave no further clues to identify Leung.  In my view, the factthat the two predecessors-in-title and Wong had to be identified by their respective Hong Kong Identity Card numbers in the assignmentspoke strongly that without using a unique identification document to identify Leung, the 1990 Assignment by itself was unable toperform its identification function in so far as Leung was concerned.  In my view, a difficulty of identification arose under the1990 Assignment.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> It is trite law that where a difficulty of identification arises under a deed, extrinsic evidence is admissible to identify the personmentioned in the instrument: <i>Sunluck International Development Ltd. v Hing King Development Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%204%20HKC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 4 HKC 134.</a>  In my view, the PA provided just the kind of evidence that was needed to prove the identity of Leung beyond reasonable doubt.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> From the fact that the PA and the 1990 Assignment were both prepared by YLY, that the PA was dated a mere 10 days earlier than the1990 Assignment equipping Wong with the power to execute the assignment on behalf of Leung, and that the PA and the 1990 Assignmentwere registered in the Land Registry on the same date under successive memorial numbers with the PA being registered first, the irresistibleand only inference was that Wong was relying upon the power given to him by Leung under the PA to sign the 1990 Assignment. </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> When the 1990 Assignment and the PA were read together, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the Leung who had acquiredthe title to the Property jointly with Wong was the Leung whose name was âæ¢çéâ in Chinese and âLeung Shui Hoi Sallyâin English, who was holding an Australian passport bearing the number [zzz], and whose husband was Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> From the above analysis, I am satisfied that the PA was relevant to and required for proof of the chain of title to the Propertybecause without the PA, the identity of Leung as one of the purchasers named in the 1990 Assignment could not be established beyondreasonable doubt.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am not questioning the correctness of the decision of <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> and its line of authorities.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> In <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>, the court was called upon to decide whether the failure to produce the power of attorney under which the purchaser (Madam Lau) usedto execute the assignment amounted to a failure to show good title.  His Honour Judge Patrick Chan (as he then was) held that sinceMadam Lau or her attorney was not required to execute the assignment for passing of title to Madam Lau, the power of attorney wasirrelevant and unnecessary for proof of title.  The focus was solely on the transfer function of the assignment.  Insofar as theidentification function of the assignment to Madam Lau was concerned, the learned judge had not been asked to rule upon it.  A closerexamination of the facts revealed that the identity of Madam Lau had never been called into question.  Although Madam Lau did notherself execute the assignment, she signed personally on the sale and purchase agreement that led to the assignment when she purchasedthe property, and she also executed the assignment by which she sold the property to the defendant vendors. </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> In light of the particular facts of the case in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>, it cannot be regarded as an authority for the sweeping proposition that a power of attorney under which a purchaser has executedan assignment for transfer of title to the property to him is irrelevant for any purpose, needs not be produced for proof of title,and should be completely ignored.  In my view, each case depends on its own facts.  If the power of attorney contains evidence necessaryto complete the title to the property, for instance, providing evidence for the identification of the purchaser, it will be relevantto and required for proof of title even though it is not required for completing the transfer of title unto the purchaser.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Mr. Stock has also referred me to other authorities.  He relies particularly upon <i>Choi Hung Investment Co. Ltd.</i> where he says the issue of identity had arisen, but the principle in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> was still held to be applicable.  In this case, three assignments of the property were involved in the chain of title.  The centralissue was whether the person who took the assignment under the first assignment was the same person who assigned the property underthe second assignment.  One of the objections was that since the original of the first assignment was missing and the copy that wasregistered in the Land Office did not bear the signature of the first assignee, it was not possible to compare the signature of thefirst assignee with the signature of the assignor in the second assignment so that it could not be verified if they were the sameperson.  Rogers J. (as he then was) followed <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> and held that this objection was invalid because the absence of a valid execution by the first assignee did not affect the titleto the property.  The learned judge however had never ruled that since it was not necessary to produce the original of the firstassignment to prove title, the issue of identity was also resolved.  Instead, his lordship analyzed the evidence carefully and heldthat it had been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the first assignee and the assignor in the second assignment were the same person. The evidence used for determining the identity issue included a copy of the first assignment (albeit without the first assigneeâssignature) and the two statutory declarations made by the second assignee under the second assignment.  One matter of significancerelied upon by the learned judge was that the assignee under the first assignment and the assignor under the second assignment hadthe same address at â98 Creffield Road London W3â.  In my view, it is clear that the learned judge had considered that executionof an assignment for assigning title to the property to the assignee and the identity of the assignee were two separate and distinctissues, and held that the principle in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> applied to the former but not to the latter.  Hence, the fact that the principle in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> was held applicable in <i>Choi Hung Investment Co. Ltd.</i> was not an authority to say that the PA in the present case was not relevant to or was not required for proof of the identity ofLeung.  On the contrary, the learned judgeâs reference to the first assigneeâs address in the first assignment, which was notrequired to prove execution of the assignment, clearly showed that the very same document was held to be relevant and admissiblefor proof of identity.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Mr. Stock also refers to <i>Lau Kwok-cheong Dinnes</i>.  In this case, the plaintiff raised a requisition on the execution of a memorandum of agreement and condition of exchange wherebythe government granted to the defendant the property in question in exchange for the defendant surrendering other lots of land. The defendant executed the conditions of exchange by his attorney.  The plaintiff asked for a certified copy of the power of attorneyto show due execution of the conditions of exchange.  While maintaining that it was not necessary to do so, the defendant neverthelesssupplied the power of attorney, and the plaintiff sought to raise further requisitions but they were not answered.  Mr. Stock stressesthat<i>Lau Kwok-cheong Dinnes</i> was similar to the present case in that the power of attorney had been produced, but Deputy Judge Jeremy Poon still held that thepower of attorney was not required for proof of title.  In my view, this case was different from the present case.  In that case,the learned judge held that title to the property had passed to the defendant, not by due execution of the conditions of exchange,but by operation of law upon compliance of the conditions, and hence it was not necessary to produce the power of attorney, followingthe principle in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>.  The issue of identity was never before the learned judge, and it cannot be regarded as an authority to say that the power of attorneywas irrelevant to proof of identity.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Mr. Stock has also argued that the PA in the present case was not a document of title and hence it was not required to be producedand could be ignored. This submission overlaps with the second ground of distinction drawn by Mrs. Chan between the present caseand <i>Lee Kim-ha</i>, i.e. the PA in the present case had been registered in the Land Office while the one in <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> had not.  I shall deal with them together.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> In <i>Wong Pik-ching v Yu Hon Chung &amp; Another</i>, unreported, HCMP No. 2969 of 1996, Mr. Recorder Edward Chan QC stated that: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI am of the view that prima facie when an instrument was registered against the property and it was not apparent from the landsearch that the document had ceased to affect the property, the document ought to be treated as part of the title deeds which thevendor should make available to the purchaser.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> This statement was approved in <i>Chen</i> by the Court of Final Appeal.  Li, C.J. agreed that this approach was sound provided it was understood that the registered instrumentshad to be properly registrable under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a>, Chapter 128 (âLROâ).  The learned Chief Justice however stressed that on this approach, the matter was only prima facie andit might therefore be displaced on examination.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2</a> of LRO provides that only instruments that may affect interests in land may be registered in the Land Office.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Since the PA had been registered in the Land Office, Mrs. Chan must be right in her submission that the PA was presumed to be a documentof title by virtue of these authorities.  Mr. Stock does not argue otherwise but contends that the briefest glance at the 1990 Assignmentwould reveal that this presumption had been rebutted since the PA was used only for execution by the assignees.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> I do not agree with this submission.  The 1990 Assignment should not be glanced at briefly.  Had it been read carefully, it wouldhave revealed that the identification of Leung in the 1990 Assignment was deficient and reference had to be made to the PA for thenecessary particulars to put the identity of Leung beyond reasonable doubt.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In <i>Tang Wing Lam David &amp; Another v Chung Chi Keung Frederick</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20HKC%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 HKC 533</a>, Barnett J. stated as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt seems to me, therefore, that in Hong Kong, by convention, the phrase âtitle deedsâ embraces not only documents by whichtitle or interest is actually transferred but also documents which contain evidence necessary to complete the title.â</p>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ I consider that in Hong Kong any other document which affects a title falls within the definition of title deeds.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> In my view, while the PA in the present case did not actually transfer or was required for acknowledging receipt of the title tothe Property, it did contain evidence necessary to complete the title in that it provided the information to prove beyond reasonabledoubt the identity of one of the assignees Leung.  I find that the PA was a title deed within the meaning of the term as definedby Barnett J.  Alternatively, since the PA had been properly registered in the Land Office, it was presumed to be a document of title,and that presumption had not been rebutted.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Having considered the submissions made by Mrs. Chan and Mr. Stock, I accept that the present case is distinguished from <i>Lee Kim-ha</i> on the two grounds submitted by Mrs. Chan.  I reject the defence contention and find that the PA was a document relevant to and requiredfor proof of title, and that Mr. Wong was not entitled to ignore it once it had been supplied by JKTH to DW&amp;P.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> If I am wrong in this finding, there is still the second issue whether it was justified for Mr. Wong to ignore the PA.  In this respect,it depends on the extent of his duties, both contractual and tortuous owed towards the Plaintiff, as a solicitor instructed by apurchaser to carry out all conveyancing work for completing the purchase of a property.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> It is beyond doubt that, in the realm of conveyancing, a purchaserâs solicitor is under a heavy duty to protect his client againstpossible future hazard, and hence he is obliged to make reasonable enquires and searches into title to the property due to be acquiredby his client to ensure that the vendor can show a good legal title free from adverse interests: <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence,</i> 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, paragraphs 10-193.  He should take care with searches and enquiries and the replies received should be properly considered:paragraph 10-195.  If there are suspicious circumstances that set alarm bells ringing about whether there is an underlying problemand prompt further actions, he must take the further actions: paragraph 10-195.  He is under a duty to advise his client about importantmatter that comes to his notice, such as the existence of a right of way or a defect of title, and must warn his client about risksthat the client may not appreciate since a person who goes to a lawyer with respect to a land transaction is entitled to expect thatlawyer to investigate the state of any title that is germane to the matter and to explain to the client exactly what it is that isportrayed by the state of the title: paragraph 10-199. </p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Mr. Stock does not argue against the existence of such duties upon Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P.  What he stresses is that they were onlyunder a duty to examine âthe documents of titleâ in order to check for potential blots on title, and they were not required tolook at âextraneous materialsâ to try to investigate whether there might be any potential blots on title.  It is of course Mr.Stockâs contention that the PA was not a document of title but extraneous matters.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> I do not agree with Mr. Stockâs submission.  It is clear from the general propositions relating to the duties of a solicitor actingfor a purchaser in a conveyancing transaction, as extracted from <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence,</i> 5<sup>th</sup> Edition and referred to above, that he has to alert himself to any suspicious circumstances that may indicate the existence of anyproblem relating to the title to the property, and that he has to make enquiries and searches to ensure that the title to the propertythat his client is going to acquire is not doubtful.  To protect his client from possible future hazard, the solicitor of coursehas to ensure that the client will get not only a good title, but also a title that will bring no risk of litigation if his clientchooses to sell the property in the future.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Mr. Stock has not cited any authority to me to show that a solicitor acting for a purchaser client is not required to investigatesuspicious circumstances that are not apparent from an examination of documents of title but from other extraneous circumstances. On the contrary, Clough J.A. observed in <i>Kan Wingâyau and Another v Hong Kong Housing Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 187</a> as follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe purchaser is always entitled to proof of all matters of fact which are part of or affect the title: <i>Williams on Vendor and Purchaser</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed., Vol. 1, p. 190.  In <i>Fry on Specific Performance</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> ed., 1921, at para. 889 (which was approved by the House of Lords in <i>M.E.P.C. Ltd. v Christian-Edwards</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 205</a> at p. 220 A-B), there appears the following statement:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â889. The doubt which may prevent the court from compelling the purchaser to accept a title may be a doubt either of law or of factâ¦ and, as to fact, <i>it may be in reference to facts appearing on the title, or to facts extrinsic to it</i>.  Again, it may be about a matter of fact which admits of proof, but has not been satisfactorily proved, or about such a matter asfrom its nature admits of no satisfactory proof, as the negative proposition that there was no creditor of the vendor capable oftaking advantage of an act of bankruptcy.â (My italics)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> In my view, when a court is entitled to declare that a purchaser is not bound to accept a title that is found to be doubtful becauseof facts appearing on the title as well as facts extrinsic to it, I can see no reason why a solicitor acting for a purchaser is onlyrequired to examine the title deeds and documents but is not required to investigate facts extrinsic to the deeds and documents,even if those extrinsic facts do set the alarm bells ringing.  A doubt is a doubt, no matter how it comes to the notice of the investigatingsolicitor.  I accept the submission by Mrs. Chan that in conveyancing, the solicitor owed a very onerous duty to make sure that hechecks everything, that he advises the client of any possible hazard, and that if there is any possible hazard, he should not acceptthe title.  Bearing in mind these onerous duties, I reject Mr. Stockâs submission that Mr. Wong or DW&amp;P was not required toexamine the PA even if the PA (contrary to my earlier ruling) was not a title deed or a part of the documents of title.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> For reasons above, I am of the view that the PA was a title deed or document, and even if it is not, it was still relevant to andrequired for proof of title.  Even if this finding were incorrect, Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P were still required, in discharge of theircontractual and tortuous duties towards the Plaintiff to exercise reasonable skill and care, to examine the PA, identify discrepanciesif any between the PA and other documents of title as well as all other facts that came to the notice of Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P, andraised the necessary requisitions. </p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Accordingly, I am unable to agree with the defence primary argument and I reject it.</p>    <p class="heading">The defence secondary argument</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>106. Mr. Stock submits that there is simply nothing discrepant in the sense of a positive inconsistency that would give rise to doubtsas to title as between the identification of Leung in the PA and the 1997 Assignment.  It is both Mr. Wongâs evidence and Mr. Stockâssubmission that the Discrepancies were not discrepancies at all for two reasons. </p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> First, Mr. Stock submits that there was nothing inconsistent between Leungâs use of an English signature in the PA and a Chinesesignature in the 1997 Assignment because it was perfectly normal for a Hong Kong person to have a Chinese signature as well as anEnglish signature.  He submits that since the two signatures were not signed in the same language, there was no inconsistency inthe positive sense. </p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Second, Mr. Stock submits that there was nothing inconsistent between the reference to Leungâs passport in the PA and the referenceto her Hong Kong Identity Card in the 1997 Assignment because it was perfectly normal for a Hong Kong person to have a foreign passportas well as a Hong Kong Identity Card.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Mr. Stock has referred me to a number of authorities where the court held that there was no problem with the title to the propertyeven though there were minor in the signatures and identification documents.  Such authorities include <i>Lee Yeung-chun and another v Ng Choi-chun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20468" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 468</a>; <i>Buildon Investment Co. Ltd. v Leung Sai-yum</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%202%20HKC%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 2 HKC 499</a><i>; Many Wise Investments Ltd. v Tech Profit Development Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20HKC%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 HKC 517</a>; <i>Leung Yam-tim v Ho Tak Man</i>, unreported, HCMP3752/1990; <i>Sunluck International Development Ltd. v Hing King Development Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%204%20HKC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 4 HKC 134.</a></p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> I do not find any of these authorities helpful.  It is obvious to me that each of these cases was decided on the basis of its ownfacts.  For instance, in <i>Buildon Investment Co. Ltd.</i>, one factor of significance relied upon was that the signature of the beneficiary in the deed of renunciation compared well withthat in the assent and the deed of assignment.  In <i>Many Wise Investments Ltd.</i>, Woo J. (as he then was) considered that the discrepancies between the two signatures which were affixed 34 years apart were notso significant as to cause any concern.  In <i>Leung Yam-tim</i>, the signatures in the two assignments were affixed eleven years apart and the identity cards with the same number were producedand recorded.  In <i>Sunluck International Development Ltd.</i>, the discrepancies in the identity of the assignee in an assignment, which was a company limited, was resolved by the unique businessregistration number on the deed. </p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> None of these cases bear close resemblance to the present case.  In my view, it is important to bear in mind that in the presentcase, the Discrepancies had two limbs: Leungâs signatures on the PA and the 1997 Assignment were different, <u>and</u> Leungâs identification documents in the PA and the 1997 Assignment were different and they were issued by two different issuingauthorities.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> As far as the signature discrepancy is concerned, I do not accept Mr. Stockâs submission that since Leung merely used differentlanguages to sign her name on the PA and in the 1997 Assignment, there was ânothing discrepant in the sense of a positive inconsistencyâwhich would give rise to doubts as to title.  In my view, if there is an inconsistency between two signatures, they are inconsistent,and there is no such thing called positive or negative inconsistency.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> In this regard, it is important to bear in mind what McMullin J. had said in <i>Ma Chun-man v Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20HKLR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] HKLR 26</a> about the significance of a signature.   The learned judge said: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt may well be, as Mr. Chang says, that signatures may vary with the passage of time and moreover that, especially in Hong Kong,different forms may be employed to render in English the romanized version of a Chinese name.  For all that, <i>a personal signature bearing as it does the special impress of its userâs identity, retains, under all variations of custom or usage,its essential significance as the pre-eminent authenticating mark.</i>  The failure to note the plain dissimilarity in the signatures and the possible danger it might pose to good title can be said toamount to that âcrassa negligentiaâ referred to by Lord Ellenborough in the passage quoted in paragraph 1006 of Charlesworthto which counsel has referred.â (My italics)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> I cannot agree more with the learned judge.  A personal signature must be a unique authenticating mark that can be used to verifyor identify the true identity of the maker of the signature.  It is through the use of signatures as identical as possible (givingdue allowance for the failing hands) that the signor can identify himself and represent to the outside world that it is the sameperson making these signatures even though he does not sign on every occasion under the watchful eyes of others.  Likewise, anyoneby comparing the similarities or otherwise of the two signatures can decide whether the same person has signed them and identifythe signor.  In my view, two signatures cannot be more different when they are made in two different languages, because the differencebetween them will not be just a question of degree but there is in fact no resemblance between the two at all.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> In addition, I am of the view that it is wrong to resolve the issue of similarities or dissimilarities of a signature by referenceto the language in which it was used to make the signature.  A signature is a personal identification mark that should have no bearingto the language used.  A Chinese person may use an English signature as her one and only signature, and has no signature in Chinese. In fact, many people do not sign in any particular language but just make a mark or scribble in whatever way they like, and thatwas in fact what Wong had done when he executed the 1990 and the 1997 Assignments.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> In <i>Kan Wing-yau</i>, one of the objections raised was that the identity of the donor of the 1964 power of attorney had not been shown to be that of theprevious purchaser since the Chinese signatures appeared to be different.  It was held that this was a ground for concern, and thatgood title to the property had not been shown.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> As far as discrepancy in the identification documents is concerned, Leung was identified in the PA by production of her AustralianPassport bearing the number [zzz] and in the 1997 Assignment by her Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy].  There cannotbe any argument that the identification documents were different.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> From Mr. Wongâs evidence and Mr. Stockâs submissions, it appears that they are not really saying that there were no discrepanciesbetween the respective signatures and identity documents in the PA and in the 1997 Assignment.  What they are putting forward isin fact an explanation by Wong to justify why these discrepancies did not cause him concern about the identity of the Leung in thetwo documents.  They say that this was just a case of two signatures being used by Leung, and it was normal for Chinese people tohave one signature in Chinese and the other in English.  They also say this was not a case of discrepancy in identity documents becauseit is normal for a Hong Kong resident to hold both a Hong Kong Identity Card and a foreign passport, and Mr. Wong describes himselfto be one of this group of people.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> With the greatest respect, whether or not it is usual for a Chinese people to sign in two different languages and for a Hong Konga resident having a Hong Kong Identity Card to hold a foreign passport is beside the point.  In discharging his duties as the Plaintiffâssolicitor to complete the purchase in 1997, Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P had to ensure that the Vendors had shown good title, and it isimportant to bear in mind that the burden of proof is not just on balance of probabilities, but beyond reasonable doubt: <strong><i>MEPC Ltd</i></strong>; and <i>Chi Kit Company Limited</i>. </p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> In my view, before Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P advised the Plaintiff to accept title from the Vendors, what he should have asked were:while it was likely or even probable that Leung had signed the PA in English and the 1997 Assignment in Chinese, had it been provedbeyond reasonable doubt that the Leung who signed her name in English in the PA was the same Leung who signed her name in Chinesein the 1997 Assignment? And while it was likely or even probable that Leung was holding both a Hong Kong Identity Card and an Australianpassport, had it been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Leung who was holding the Australian Passport bearing number [zzz]was in fact the same Leung who was holding the Hong Kong Identity Card bearing the number [yyy], and if so, had it been further provedbeyond reasonable doubt that this particular Leung would sign her names in the 1997 Assignment in Chinese when she had previouslysigned the PA in English? </p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> As apparent from the letters dated 6<sup>th</sup> August 2001 (see paragraph 41) and dated 21<sup>st</sup> September 2001(see paragraph 49), these were not the questions that ran through the mind of Mr. Wong at the material times.  By sayingin the letters that it was âusualâ or ânot unusualâ for a holder of Hong Kong Identity Card to also hold and be identifiedby an Australian passport, and taking the view that Leung had just signed in two different languages, he had fallen into the errorof asking the wrong question.  What he should have asked was not what was usual or probable, but on the evidence before him, whetherit had been proved beyond reasonable doubt, despite the Discrepancies, that the Leung in the PA was the same Leung in the 1997 Assignment. An examination of Mr. Wongâs witness statement, his oral testimony in court, as well as all letters he had previously writtento T&amp;C and S&amp;C in relation to the Requisition clearly reveals that Mr. Wong had no other evidence to establish that the twoLeungs were the same person other than the various aspects in the deeds and documents that he referred to.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> It is Mr. Wongâs evidence and Mr. Stockâs submissions that there were a number of aspects of the documentation that, when takentogether, made it beyond a shadow of doubt, even in 1997, that short of an elaborate fraud, the Leung referred to in the PA was thesame Leung referred to in the 1997 provisional sale and purchase agreement, the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment.  They reliedupon four matters.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Firstly, it was pointed out that Leung was identified in all documents by her Chinese and English names with no discrepancies.  Thatis correct but the issue was whether the two Leungs apparently having the same English name and Chinese name were the same personsince they signed differently and had different identity documents.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> Secondly, it was said that in the 1997 provisional sale and purchase agreement, the 1997 Agreement and the 1997 Assignment, Leunghad been identified by her Hong Kong Identity Card, and she signed her names in Chinese, that her signatures in the 1997 Agreementand 1997 Assignment were attested by solicitors, and that her Hong Kong Identity Card must have been viewed in the attestation process. In my view, what are stated is correct as a matter of fact, but it does not answer the question whether the two Leungs were thesame person.  In particular, I noted that different persons were in charge of the different attestation processes of various documents. Leungâs execution of the PA was attested to by John Frederick Henry in Melbourne, the execution of the 1990 Assignment was attestedto by Lam Wai Kuen Alex of YLY when Wong signed and Leung was not present, and the execution of the 1997 Assignment was attestedby Flora S. W. Li of JKTH.  It is therefore clear that none of these persons who took part in the various attestation processes couldconfirm the Leung before him or her was also the same Leung who executed the other documents.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> Thirdly, it was said that Wong was the donor of the PA, the only other co-owner of the Property and had been identified by his HongKong Identity Card number in all relevant sale and purchase agreements and assignments with proper attestation.  It was thereforesubmitted that since there could not be any dispute that the two Wongâs in the PA and the 1997 Assignment were the same person,there could not be any realistic suggestion that the two Leungâs were different persons because Leung had described Wong as herhusband in the PA and they were described to be cohabiting in the same address at all material times, firstly in the Property whenthe 1990 Assignment was executed, and then in another address when the 1997 Assignment was executed.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> Mrs. Chan has taken issue on whether it had been shown that Wong and Leung had cohabited in the same address.  In my view, Mrs. Chanâscontention has substantial forces.  The PA was dated 29<sup>th</sup> August 1990.  Wongâs address was described to be in an industrial building in Kwai Chung while Leung was described as living inAustralia.  About 10 days later when the 1990 Assignment dated 7<sup>th</sup> September 1990 was executed, Wong and Leung were described in the deed to be cohabiting in the Property.  That was plainly incorrectas a matter of fact.  Wong and Leung could not have by 7<sup>th</sup> September 1990 taken possession of the Property, and Leung could not have resided there at that time when she was in Australia, andher absence in Hong Kong was clearly the reason why the PA had to be executed.  In other words, Leung could not be identified byusing the indicia that she was the Leung who resided at the Property on 7<sup>th</sup> September 1990.  Furthermore, the evidence shows that solicitors preparing the assignments would just put down the addresses in accordancewith clientâs instructions without verification.  It was clear from the letter dated 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2001 from YLY that they had never met Leung, and Leungâs address in the 1990 Assignment could only be put down accordingto their instructions from Wong and not from Leung.  The present case was different from <i>Choi Hung Investment Co. Ltd.</i> where the evidence proved that the first assignee in the 1973 assignment and the assignor in the immediate subsequent assignmentin 1991 were having the same address in London which provided an important indicia of identity.  In my view, the address of Leungas stated in various documents might well provide some evidential proof of identity, but it was not sufficient proof, and certainlydid not have the substantial force to answer queries that had been raised by the discrepancies in the signatures and identity documents.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Fourth, it is submitted that short of an elaborate fraud, there could be no doubt that the two Leungs were the same person in thePA and the 1997 Assignment.  It is submitted that the court does not require a purchaserâs solicitor to raise requisitions in respectof some fanciful risk.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> In my view, this point is defeated by the submission itself.  A purchaserâs solicitor has of course a duty to detect and eliminatethe possibility of fraud, including the possibility of an elaborate fraud.  Mr. Stock submits that if the court requires a purchaserâssolicitor to check every written document against the possibility of fraud then the entire system of conveyancing would collapse. I do not agree.  What a purchaserâs solicitor is required to do is simply to make all customary and reasonable searches and enquiriesin light of the particular circumstances of the case handled by him.  I agree with Mrs. Chan who submits that the law is not thata solicitor is required to make enquiries only when there are some sort of unusual irregularities or some evidence of positive fraud,but the law is that whenever a purchaserâs solicitor is put on notice of something irregular, he should make enquiry.  In the presentcase, the two Leungs signed differently and with different identity documents, was it not sufficient to ring an alarm bell that theremight be an issue relating to the identity of the two Leungs?</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> Mrs. Chan submits that it was significant to note that Mr. Wong had admitted in his evidence that if Leung had been identified firstof all by an Australian passport and then by a USA passport, that would have created a doubt as to the identity of that person. Mrs. Chan submits that there was no material difference with the present case when Leung was identified firstly by a particular Australianpassport and then by her Hong Kong Identity Card.  I accept Mrs. Chanâs submission. </p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Mr. Stock places considerable reliance upon the case of <i>Lee Yeung-chun v Ng Choi-chun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20468" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 468.</a>  In this case, it was held that good title to the property had been shown although the vendorâs predecessor-in-title were describedwith different passport numbers and had signed his middle name differently at the time of his purchase and his sale.  In my view,this case differed from the present case in material respects.  First, in that case, the difference in the signature was that thepredecessor-in-title signed his full name in the assignment at the time of purchase but he signed only with his initials in the assignmentwhen he sold the property. Godfrey J. (as he then was) was satisfied that there was nothing in this discrepancy, and he also foundthat the signatures were under the same hands.  In the present case, the two signatures of Leung were in my view completely differentas they were signed in different languages.  Second, in that case, the difference was only in respect of the number of the passport,and this was clearly understandable since there had been a lapse of eleven years between the two assignments.  On both occasion,the predecessor-in-title was holding an American passport.  In the present case however, Leung was identified by two different identitydocuments issued by two different issuing authorities, one by the Australian Government and the other by the Hong Kong Government.Not every Hong Kong resident has an Australian passport.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Mr. Stock also relies upon the presumption of due execution in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a></i>, which provides that an instrument appearing to be duly executed shall be presumed until the contrary is proved to have been dulyexecuted.  I do not consider the presumption assists the defence. </p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> Mrs. Chan submits that the challenge here was not that the assignments or documents were not properly executed, but that the 1997Assignment could have been validly executed by someone known as Leung Shui Hoi Sally but that someone was not the Leung Shui HoiSally who executed the PA.  Furthermore, even if the presumption were found to have arisen, it was rebutted because of the differencein the signatures and the identity documents in the PA and the 1997 Assignment.  In <i>Kan Wing-yau</i>, it was held that the difference in signatures in itself was sufficient to show that there was no appearance of due execution.  Iaccept the submissions of Mrs. Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> I have considered the evidence of Mr. Wong and the submissions of Mr. Stock very carefully.  I am not persuaded that the variousaspects in the documentation referred to by the defence amount to sufficient proof beyond reasonable doubt that it was the same Leungwho executed the PA and the 1997 Assignment.  In <i>Lam Kin-i v Tsui Ming-yee</i>, unreported, HCMP361/1989, the vendor was under a duty to prove that the same person had signed in 1960 on the first assignment aspurchaser and then in 1977 in the subsequent assignment as vendor so as to show good title.  This person was described by the samename (John Tin On Wong) in the two assignments but the two signatures were materially different from one another.  Godfrey J. (ashe then was) held that because of the discrepancies in signature, âproper conveyancing evidenceâ was required to prove that thetwo Wongs were the same person.  The vendor contended that Wong took the property jointly with another person in 1960 and soughtto convey the property jointly in 1977 was strong circumstantial evidence to prove that the two signatories were of the same person,despite the discrepancies in the signatures.  The learned judge held that: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI have no doubt that the circumstantial evidence is a pointer to the conclusion that the two signatories are in fact that of thesame person.  But I am not satisfied that this is enough.  A pointer is not evidence.  Circumstantial evidence is not sufficient. Proper conveyancing evidence demands more than this.  It demands something on the lines of the statutory declaration to which Ihave referred, or some other evidence which will satisfy the purchaser, and any purchaser from him, that the title is good one. While this circumstantial evidence may be enough to convince me, I cannot, objectively speaking, take the view that it would be unreasonablefor this or a subsequent purchase to suggest that it is simply not enough.  I am not entitled to force a doubtful title upon thepurchaser.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> In my view, the observation by the learned judge is equally applicable in the present case.  Even if it were right for Mr. Wong tocontend that the matters he referred to in the documentation as pointers for identifying the Leung in the 1997 Assignment was thesame Leung in the PA, these were no more than circumstantial evidence that was simply not enough for proving good title.  I rejectthe defence secondary argument.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> It is also very important to bear in mind that Godfrey J. had pointed out specifically that the vendor has to provide evidence thatwill satisfy not only the purchaser but also âany purchaser from himâ that good title has been shown.  In other words, Mr. Wonghad to bear in mind not only that he had no doubt that the two Leungs referred to in the PA and the 1997 Assignment were the sameperson, but also that he had to satisfy that any prospective purchaser who might buy the Property from the Plaintiff should she decideto sell would share his view and take no issue with the Discrepancies, or else the Plaintiff would run into difficulties in her subsequentsale.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> In the present case, it is beyond argument that good title could not be shown by either the Plaintiff to Chan, or by the Vendorsto the Plaintiff, unless it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Leung who obtained title to the Property jointly with Wongunder the 1990 Assignment was the same Leung who executed the 1997 Assignment in favour of the Plaintiff.  The 1990 Assignment showedthat the Property was vested in Wong and the Leung who signed her name in English and who was identified by an Australian Passportbearing the number [zzz].  The Leung who executed the 1997 Assignment was a person who identified herself by a signature in Chineseand by production of her Hong Kong Identity Card.  Since only the person who had been vested with the title to the Property in 1990could have the title to assign in 1997, it was imperative for Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P to look for evidence that would establish beyondreasonable doubt that the two Leungs were the same person.  The Discrepancies identified by S&amp;C in fact stood out conspicuouslyand cried out for explanation.  I cannot accept the defence secondary argument that there was nothing in the Discrepancy, or thatthere were no discrepancies.  Mr. Wong had clearly fallen into the error by assuming that the PA was only relevant insofar as thetransfer of title was concerned, but ignored the fact that there was deficiency in the 1990 Assignment in the identification of Leung,and the PA provided the necessary particulars of Leung to put her identity beyond reasonable doubt.  I also found that Mr. Wong hadfailed to realize that when the Plaintiff sought to sell the Property in the future, it was likely that the prospective purchaserwould point to the Discrepancies and demand for proof that the two Leungs were the same person, and by then, the Plaintiff wouldhave to answer the requisition from the position of a vendor and not that of a purchaser.   </p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> I find that the Requisition had been validly and properly raised by S&amp;C, and that it should have been raised in 1997 by Mr. Wongand DW&amp;P when they acted for the Plaintiff in completing the purchase.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Breach of duty</u></p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> It is settled law that a solicitor owes to his client not only his contractual duty under his retainer but also a duty in tort toexercise reasonable skill and care: <i>Feerni Development Ltd. v Daniel Wong &amp; Partners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 13.</a></p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> A solicitorsâ duty is defined by the terms and limits of his retainer and any duty of care to be imposed must be related to whathe is instructed to do.  The duties arising from the retainer are to be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances ofthe case.  The test is what a reasonably competent solicitor would do having regard to the standards normally adopted in his profession:  See <i>Midland Bank v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Ch 384</a>; but he will not be liable for a mere error of judgment: <i>Feerni Development Ltd.</i></p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> In <i>Sihombing and Wilkinson</i>, <i>Hong Kong Conveyancing Law and Practice</i>, Issue 35, at paragraph VI [256], the importance of checking names, signatures and identity numbers for consistency has been statesas follows: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is part and parcel of proving title the due execution of title documents and this involves checking the names, signatures andidentity numbers of the present and previous parties for consistency.  For example, if your client is now executing as vendor, youshould check that his signature and identity number is the same as when he executed as purchaser.  If there is material discrepancy,it is the duty of the vendor to supply adequate conveyancing evidence to resolve any doubt, since such discrepancy, if unresolved,might amount to a defect in title.  Problems encountered in this area are becoming more common and can often be easily remedies byan appropriate statutory declaration, but failure to identify the problem in advance may prove costly to the vendor and his solicitor.</p>        <p class="quote">There is also a duty upon the solicitor acting for the purchaser to check for discrepancies in signatures to ensure that the titlepurchased by oneâs client may not be called into question on a subsequent sale.  Such was the case in <i>Ma Chun-man v Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20HKLR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] HKLR 26</a> where the solicitors acting for a client on the purchase of property were held liable in negligence for failing to notice a discrepancyin signatures, as a result of which a subsequent sale was delayed for over a year.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> In my view, Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P were clearly under a duty to check the names, signatures and identity numbers of the Vendors forconsistency.  Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P had at least two opportunities to discover the Discrepancies.  First, Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P hadbeen provided with photocopy of Leungâs Hong Kong Identity Card before the 1997 Agreement was signed.  By that time, they musthave known that Leung was identified by her Hong Kong Identity Card and when they received the title deeds and documents from JKTHincluding the PA, they should have noticed that Leung had never been identified previously by a Hong Kong identity card, and thatshe had never signed her name in Chinese.  The second opportunity came of course at the time when the 1997 Assignment was sent toDW&amp;P for the execution of the Plaintiff.  However, on none of these occasions had the Plaintiff been advised of the Discrepanciesand had never been told of the possible implication.  At no time had Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P raised any requisitions in this regard. I find that at the time when the 1997 Assignment was executed, the Vendors had not shown good title because of the Discrepancies,but nothing had been done by Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> What Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P had failed to do, in my view, was what a reasonably competent solicitor would not have failed to do. S&amp;C had done it, and T&amp;C accepted that the Requisition was proper.  It is important to bear in mind that Mr. Wong and DW&amp;Phad a duty to protect the Plaintiff from possible future hazard, and to ensure that the title she had acquired from the Vendors wasfree from any patent cloud, and free from any risk or possibility of litigation.  In considering whether good title had been shown,I appreciate that the court has to use reasonably robust common sense, and I might come to the conclusion that a good title had beenshown if Leung had used the same identity documents but signed her name in a different language, or if she used different identitydocuments but signed her name in identical ways (that of course presupposed it to be in the name language).  However, this was notthe situation here.  Using my common sense as robustly as I can, in light of the Discrepancies, I can never come to the conclusionthat the Requisition raised by S&amp;C could be classified as a fanciful risk, or a claim that could be laughed out of court.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> I have also considered whether Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P could be exonerated from liability on the ground that they had just fallen intoan error of judgment.  However, bearing in mind that it was so fundamental and obvious for a solicitor to check names, signaturesand identity numbers to ensure consistency, I am of this view that this is a clear case of negligence.  In saying so, I have bornein mind what was said by McMullin J. in <i>Ma Chun-man</i> cited in paragraph 113 above.  What Mr. Wong has said in evidence was that it was not that he did not notice the Discrepancies, buthe found it not necessary and even it was stupid to raise the requisition.  However, with the greatest respect, he was acting onthe basis that it was usual for a Hong Kong resident to have two different signatures, one in Chinese and one in English, and thatit was also usual for her to hold a foreign passport, and from that basis he assumed Leung to be in this group of Hong Kong residents. However, in a conveyancing exercise, there is no place for assumption but proof beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the titledeeds and documents and proper conveyancing evidence.  In fact, what needed to be done was extremely minimal. The Vendors could beasked to make a statutory declaration to confirm Leungâs identity, or Leung could have been asked to sign the Assignment againin English, or produce her Australian Passport bearing the number [zzz] to verify her identity.  Bearing in mind that it was theduty of the Vendors to show good title, it was just a great failing of duty on the part of Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P when they had failedto raise similar requisition as what S&amp;C had done, and when they failed to ask for clarification or rectification of the Discrepancies.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> I find that Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P had failed to raise requisition with the Vendors despite the presence of the Discrepancies.  Ifind that they had failed to advice the Plaintiff of the Discrepancies and failed to warn her of the risk that might flow from there. I find that they had advised the Plaintiff to accept the 1997 Assignment without the Discrepancies being clarified or rectified. In short, I find that Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P had breached their contractual and tortuous duties towards the Plaintiff to exercisereasonable skill and care in acting for her in completing the 1997 purchase.  I find them liable to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> As a result of Mr. Wong and DW&amp;Pâs breach of duties, the Plaintiff was forced to annul the 2001 Sale, and she could only sellthe Property again after the Discrepancies had been rectified by a statutory declaration from Leung.  The delay in sale clearly costthe Plaintiff to lose the purchase price of $200,000.  There was no argument from the defence saying that the damage was too remoteand not recoverable, or that the Plaintiff had failed in her duty to mitigate.  There was also no challenge to the quantum on theground that the price at which the Plaintiff had subsequently sold the Property was below the then market price.  I find that thePlaintiff is entitled to recover from the Plaintiff this sum of $200,000 as damages being the diminution in the sale prices causedby delay in sale.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> The Plaintiff has also spent $1000 legal costs so that Leung could provide the statutory declaration to clarify or rectify the Discrepancies. Without this statutory declaration, the Plaintiff would not have been able to sell the Property.  I am of the view that the losswas flowing directly from the breach of duties on the part of Mr. Wong and DW&amp;P or that it was within their reasonable contemplationand was therefore recoverable.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> The Plaintiff is also claiming the sum of $16,825.00 being the amount of costs and expenses for the abortive 2001 Sale.  The amountclaimed is properly documented.  I find that they had been actually spent in the abortive sale.  Mr. Stock submits that this sumof money had to be spent by the Plaintiff in any event even if the 2001 Sale had gone through.  What the Plaintiff had lost was thecosts and expenses she had spent in the ultimate sale but she has not made any claim of that in the Statement of Claim and thereis no evidence relating to those costs and expenses in this trial.  I agree with the submission by Mr. Stock.  I reject this claim.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> There is originally a claim for loss of rent, but that claim has been abandoned during Mrs. Chanâs opening for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> There is a claim for interest.  It is apparent that there is no argument that the Plaintiff is entitled to interest on her loss,and the only argument relates to the rate of interest.  Mrs. Chan refers to <i>Feerni Development Ltd.</i> and <i>Tai Kong Enterprises v Li Hok So</i>, unreported, HCA 2251/1995 where interest were awarded at the rate of prime plus 2%.  On the other hand, Mr. Sock submits that theappropriate rate should be 1% above prime and refers to <i>Poon Mee-kuen v Chau Hor-tong</i> <i>&amp; Another,</i> unreported, HCMP1431-3/2004; <i>Ma Chi-wing Wendy v The Personal Representative of the Estate of Ma Vincent, Deceased</i>, unreported, HCA 3913/2001.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Other than the fact that the award of interest is always within the discretion of the court, I find no substantial principle forthe determination of the rate of interest.  Under these circumstances, I am inclined to adopt a lower interest rate in favour ofthe paying party.  I shall use the rate of 1% above the prime rate.  Mrs. Chan asks for interest to run from 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2001, but I find the appropriate date should be 18<sup>th</sup> September 2001 when the 2001 Sale was annulled, and hence the loss and damage had occurred.</p>    <p><u>Order</u></p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> For reasons aforesaid, I make the following orders: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    Judgment be entered for the Plaintiff against DW&amp;P in the sum of $201,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 1% abovethe prime rate from 18<sup>th</sup> September 2001 to the date of judgment and thereafter at the judgment rate until the date of payment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)    Costs of this action are to be paid by DW&amp;P to the Plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.This is an Order nisi that shall become absolute after 14 days from the date of handing down of this judgment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"> </td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">W.
