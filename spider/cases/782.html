Applications</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The defendants applied to strike out the plaintiffsâ statement of claim (âSOCâ) and to stay the proceedings on the principalgrounds that it does not disclose any reasonable cause of action and that it is an abuse of process<a>[1]</a>.  In order to meet the defendantsâ objections and to fortify the pleas, the plaintiffs applied to amend the SOC by a proposed amendedstatement of claim<a>[2]</a> (âASOCâ).  The parties agreed that I should first deal with the striking out and amendment applications and then depending onthe outcome, give directions for the disposal of the stay application.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The background is summarized as follows.</p>    <p class="heading">B.  Background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiffs are companies within the French based Total Oil group.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is a Hong Kong subsidiary distributing marine lubricants in Hong Kong for international customers of the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff who call at the Hong Kong harbour from overseas.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff is a Singapore subsidiary carrying on the same kind of business as the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff does in Singapore.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff is a French subsidiary.  It is the parent company of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, selling and distributing marine lubricants to international customers not based in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants were ex-employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  Their employments were terminated on 25 June 2008.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was then Asia-Pacific Marketing and Business Development Senior Manager and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, SAP Sales Administration and Information Systems Manager.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was employed by Total Raffinage (then known as Elf Antar France), another French subsidiary of the Total Oil group.  Theplaintiffs pleaded that on 18 July 2002, she agreed to be assigned to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff for an initial period of two years which was subsequently extended.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff entered into an implied employment contract with her at the same time as she continued to be employed by Total Raffinage. She was Managing Director between 18 July 2002 and 16 May 2008.  Thereafter, she continued to be employed the Total Raffinage andthe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff until 16 June 2008 when her employment was terminated.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant accepted that she was seconded to work in Hong Kong but denied that she was the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs employee.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant was formerly SEA Business Support Senior Manager and Asia Credit Manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff until she resigned on 2 July 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants are companies within a group entitled to use the name Gulf Oil.  The 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, a Hong Kong company, was dormant since incorporated on 4 May 1993 until 10 June 2008.  It is the current employer of the1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant is a UK company, trading in oil and greases.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 9 September 2008, the plaintiffs commenced the present action.</p>    <p class="heading">C.  An overview of the SOC</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The plaintiffsâ case is summarized in Â§1 of the SOC : they âseek damages and injunctions against their former officers andemployees (the first four defendants) in relation to breaches of contract, fiduciary and/or equitable duties and conspiracy betweenthe defendants to commit breaches of their duties owed to the plaintiffs (in contract, in tort and in equity), to remove confidentialinformation belonging to the plaintiffs and to defect and attempt to persuade other employees in a concerted move to launch the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, which was dormant until 10 June 2008, as a competitor.â</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The SOC pleaded the partiesâ background and relationship (Â§Â§2 to 10).  It then set out in relation to each of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants the contractual duties and fiduciary duties owed to their employer and equitable duties owed to all the plaintiffs (Â§Â§11to 30).  The duties are couched in similar terms.  The contractual duties include a duty to act in good faith and in the best interestof the employer.  The fiduciary duties include a duty to have no conflicts between his/her personal interests and contractual dutiesto the employer and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs case, a duty not to assist or participate in the launch of a competing business.  The equitable duty to the plaintiffsis to keep the plaintiffsâ confidential information, which they had access to or were provided with during the course of employment,confidential.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The SOC next pleaded the involvement of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in the development of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant as a competing business, how they breached the duties owed to the plaintiffs and the conspiracy (Â§Â§31 to 59); how theyinduced the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffsâ staff to breach their contracts of employment (Â§Â§60 to 62); how they wrongfully used confidential information ofthe plaintiffs (Â§Â§63 to 65); how the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant destroyed the evidence of the conspiracy by disposing of six laptop computers (Â§66).  It then pleaded the launch of the5<sup>th</sup> defendant and its Singapore branch resulting in pecuniary benefits to the defendants (Â§Â§67 to 68).  These paragraphs provided thefactual matrix from which various causes of action are raised :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) As against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, they were in breach of their employment contract and fiduciary obligation towards their employer, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, as the case may be (Â§Â§69 to 75).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) As against all the defendants except the 4<sup>th</sup>, they were in breach of equitable obligations and confidentiality towards the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs (Â§Â§63 to 65).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) As against all the defendants, they committed inducement of breach of contract as against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs (Â§Â§76 to 77), as the case may be.  They had infringed the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs copyright (Â§Â§78 to 82) and are also guilty of unlawful means conspiracy against all the plaintiffs (Â§Â§83 to 87).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In the next section headed âRemediesâ (Â§Â§88 to 97), the plaintiffs pleaded, among other things, that the whole of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendantâs business belongs in equity to them (Â§88); that they are entitled to account of profits as set out in the paragraphsbelow, alternatively damages (Â§89).  Finally, various relief are prayed for, including injunctions and declarations, account forprofits and damages.</p>    <p class="heading">D.  Applicable principles</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The applicable principles are well established.  A useful summary can be found in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009,</i> <i>Vol.1</i>, Â§18/19/4 at pp.350-351 (for striking out) and Â§20/8/6 at pp.382-383 and Â§20/8/24 at p.393 (for amendment).  I do not proposeto repeat them here except to mention two points.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  First, if a pleading is capable of being cured by amendments, it should not be struck out.  An opportunity to amend should be giveninstead.  However, if the pleading is so defective that no amendment can cure it or if the proposed amendment is incapable of improvingthe defects, the pleading is liable to be struck out and the proposed amendment should be refused.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Second, when a party seeking to amend his pleadings in order to save it from being struck out, the proposed amendment should beproperly and exactly formulated, includes all necessary averments or mandatory particulars and constitutes a full and complete pleaof a reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  With these principles in mind, I now turn to examine the SOC and ASOC in greater detail.</p>    <p class="heading">E.  The pleas of inference</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It is useful to dispose of a general point at the outset, which is this.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The SOC and ASOC are littered with pleas of inferences : Â§35 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> and last sentence); Â§40 (the last sentence); Â§49A (the entire paragraph); Â§51(the 2<sup>nd</sup> sentence); Â§59 (the 1<sup>st</sup> sentence); Â§60 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> sentence); Â§64 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> sentence); Â§65A (the entire paragraph); Â§65B (the 2<sup>nd</sup> sentence); Â§65D (the entire paragraph); and Â§72 (the 3<sup>rd</sup> sentence).  Ms Ismail submitted that these pleas of inferences provided the sources of the material facts, that is, how the plaintiffsare going to prove their case.  She readily conceded that they are evidence.  As such, they offend the elementary rule that everypleading must contain only a statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies, and not the evidence by which theyare to be proved : see Order 18, rule 7(1) of the Rules of the High Court, <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009,</i> <i>Vol.1</i>, Â§18/7/5 at p.321.  On this ground alone, they are all liable to be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In any event, the bases upon which those inferences were drawn are speculative.  Such conjectures are impermissible in a properpleading.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Accordingly, for those pleas of inferences identified above which are contained in the SOC, they are all struck out.  For thosewhich are sought to be introduced by way of the ASOC, the application for amendment is refused.  I will disregard all those pleasof inferences in the discussion below.</p>    <p class="heading">F.   Employment relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I next turn to the dispute between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant on her employee status.  If that dispute is resolved in her favour at this stage by striking out, most of the plaintiffsâcomplaints against her will fall away.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff pleaded that after she had been assigned to work in Hong Kong, the parties entered into an implied employment contractat the same time as she continued to be employed also by Total Raffinage; that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff completed an Inland Revenue Department Employerâs Return of Remuneration and Pensions for the year 1 April 2006 and 31March 2007 in which she was described as employed as a director; and that her employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was terminated on 16 June 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, in her affidavit filed for the present applications, maintained that she was only an employee of Total Raffinage undera written employment contract dated 16 January 1995.  Her monthly salary was paid by Total Raffinage into a French bank account andwas at all material times subject to tax equalization treatment so that her own salary would be the same net of tax as an equal levelseniority employee based on France.  Her performance assessments and annual reviews were conducted through senior management in France.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Coleman, SC, for the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, submitted that as a matter of law, there could be no implied contract of employment as such.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I disagree.  As a matter of law, a contract of employment can be implied : see the definition of âcontract of employmentâ in<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap.57</a>), which expressly provides for an implied contract.  And it is trite that when considering if a person was employed by another,the court will examine all the features of the partiesâ relationship against the background of the indicia of employment with aview to deciding whether, as a matter of overall impression, the relationship was one of employment : see <i>Poon Chau Nam v Yim Siu Cheung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%2010%20HKCFAR%20156" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2007) 10 HKCFAR 156.</a></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The matters relied on the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant are capable of showing that she was at the material times an employee of Total Raffinage.  But it does not necessarilyexclude the possibility that she was simultaneously employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as well.  This is a matter for trial.  The application to strike out Â§Â§19 to 27 of the SOC is refused.  The amendmentby way of Â§28A of the ASOC and the opening words âFurther or alternatively,â in Â§29 of the SOC is allowed.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I will now proceed to deal with each of the causes of action more specifically.  Although the main thrust of the plaintiffsâ caseis one of conspiracy, it is more convenient to first deal with the individual causes of action upon which the claim of conspiracyis based.</p>    <p class="heading">G.  Breach of confidence</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I will begin with breach of confidence.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  A right of action will lie where the defendant is proved to have used confidential information, directly or indirectly obtainedfrom the plaintiff, without the latterâs consent, express or implied.  Four requirements are essential :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) the plaintiff must identify clearly the information which is alleged to be confidential;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) the information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4) there must have been an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment to the party communicating it.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See <i>Bullen &amp; Leake Jacobâs Precedents of Pleadings</i>, (2008 Edn), Â§66-01 at p.1051.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The statement of claim must define with some precision the information or communication which is alleged to be confidential.  Particularsmust also be given to show that the information is confidential in character.  The relevant circumstance giving rise to the obligationof confidence and the unauthorized use must be pleaded as well.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffsâ case on breach of confidence is set out in various parts of the SOC and arranged in a rather confusing manner.  Doingthe best that I can, I first look at the case against the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants in Â§Â§63 to 65 of SOC.  The ASOC proposed to expand the claim by Â§Â§65C and 65E.

It is <i>per se</i> not objectionable but is of little significance because the case on breach of confidence is not based on the email at all.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Â§64, in its original form (without the pleas based on inferences which have been struck out), referred to a computer forensic analysison the computer equipment operated by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and, Ms Miranda Lo and Ms Ivy Chan (âMs Loâ and âMs Chanâ), two of the Departing Staff<a>[3]</a>, established that a total of 20 data storage devices were attached to their computers in the days leading up to the time they eachleft the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  Each of those 20 devices is currently missing from the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs office.  Â§65 then pleaded that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦it is likely that some or all of these persons used the missing storage devices to store and remove confidential informationbelonging to [the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs] from [the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs] possession and/or control and currently retain such confidential information on the storage devices.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There are considerable difficulties with Â§Â§64 and 65.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The alleged confidential information has not been identified.  No particulars have been provided to show that the information wasconfidential in character.  Ms Ismail relied on the contractual provisions in the employment contract that any information the employeeobtained from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs shall be maintained in confidence.  For my part, I do not think that clause detracts from the obligation on the part ofthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs to plead their case on breach of confidence sufficiently and properly.  The plea in Â§65 quoted above is no more thanspeculation.  It cannot found a case of wrongful use of the alleged confidential information.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Â§Â§64 and 65 are struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Â§65C of the ASOC pleaded :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â65C.

But in Â§52, the only information said to have been sent by the1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant on 17 June 2008 was the first available date on which that contract could be terminated.  It is incapable of supportingthe much wider plea in Â§65C(b) that the alleged confidential information included the contract as a whole.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The identification of the name and role of the staff in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs in Â§65C(c) is said to be confidential.

The plea is insufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Â§65C(d) related to the user guides to the BOS system referred to in Â§35 of the SOC.

That, however, does not necessarily follow that the amendment by Â§65C as trimmed down is permissible.  The problem lies with theplea for breach of confidence.  The plea for breach is first found in Â§65, which has already been struck out.  The plea for breachis next contained in Â§65B of the ASOC.  It is a plea based on inference.  The application to add it to the SOC has been refused. Absent any proper plea for breach, no reasonable cause of action based on breach of confidence can be raised against the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants by Â§65C (even if trimmed down) and Â§65E.  The proposed amendment by the two paragraphs is refused.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffsâ case on breach of confidence against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants are couched in similar terms : see Â§69(5), Â§70(5) and Â§71(7).  With respect to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants, the information alleged to be confidential is (a) the USB storage devices, (b) the Vietnam contract and (c) the identificationof the staff for recruitment by the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants.  The proposed amendment by the ASOC sought to include in item (c) the name and role of the staff of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs for the recruitment.  With respect to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the information did not include item (b) but included by way of the ASOC the BOS user guides.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I have already dealt with the sufficiency of the pleas on the above items as confidential information in Â§Â§40 to 43 above.  Forthose reasons, the case based on the USB storage devices, the Vietnam contract and the identification of the name and role of thestaff for recruitment by the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants cannot stand.  In any event, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs have been unable to properly plead breach of confidence.  They relied on the pleas of inferences in Â§64 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> sentences), which has been struck out, and Â§Â§65A and 65B, which application for amendment has been refused.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In the circumstances, no reasonable cause of action for breach of confidence has been pleaded against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.

The proposed amendments by way of the ASOC on thoseparagraphs are refused.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffsâ claims for breach of confidence against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>, the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants are dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">H.

They were allegedto have breached the duty of confidence by storing the alleged confidential information by the USB devices : see Â§64 (as amendedby the ASOC) and Â§65 of the SOC.  I have already struck out Â§64 in its original form and Â§65 and disallowed the proposed amendmentto Â§64.  There can be no proper plea for breach of confidence by Ms Lo and Ms Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  That leaves us with the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants.  The SOC or ASOC have failed to identify precisely who was the inducer and who was being induced in respect of a particularbreach of contract.  The only way to proceed is to look at the breaches complained of to see if there is any clue.  The breachesare three-fold : (a) recruiting the Departing Staff to join the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant and its Singapore branch; (b) breach of confidence; and (c) assisting in the launch of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On recruitment, Â§60 of the SOC pleaded that the defendants and in particular the 3<sup>rd</sup> and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had identified the Departing Staff that they wanted to recruit.  There is no plea as to who induced the breach by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Â§61 of the SOC (with some slight amendment by the ASOC) pleaded that on 23 June 2008 (that is, after she left the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff) the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant received the employment contracts of some of the Departing Staff from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant <i>via</i> email.  Â§62 of the SOC pleaded that the defendants in particular the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant were responsible for attracting the Departing Staff to join the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant and its branch in Singapore.  However, none of the Departing Staff including the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants was subject to any restraint of trade clauses preventing them from joining the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant or its Singapore branch.  What then is the breach complained of in Â§Â§61 and 62?  And who made the inducement?  One simplydoes not know.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On breach of confidence, Â§52 of the SOC dealt with an email that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant sent to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant on 17 June 2008, giving the first available date on which the Vietnam contract could terminate.  Assuming that it constituteda breach of his employment contract by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiffs have not pleaded who induced him to do so.  The next batch of pleas on breach of confidence relating tothe 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants is in Â§63, Â§64 (as amended by the ASOC) and Â§65 of the SOC and Â§Â§65A and 65B of the ASOC.  I have already disposedof them by either striking out or disallowing the amendment and dismissed the claim for breach of confidence based on them.  Thatbeing the case, no plea of breach of contract based on breach of confidence with respect to each of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants can be properly raised.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Â§66 of the SOC pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had disposed of six laptops thereby destroying the evidence of conspiracy.  That is hardly a breach of his contract.  Anyway,there is no plea as to who induced him to dispose of the laptops.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  On assisting the launch of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant and its Singapore branch, Â§Â§67 and 68 dealt with the monetary advantage that the defendants obtained by the launch. Assuming that it is a breach of their employment on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in assisting in the launch, there is no plea as to who induced each of them in committing the breach.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Finally, Ms Ismail submitted that the breaches the plaintiffs relied on are not confined to Â§77(a) of the SOC (as amended).  Theyincluded all the matters raised in Â§31 of the SOC onwards.  This I reject because it offends the elementary rule that one can neverplead a case by way of submission.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In my view, Â§Â§76 and 77 of the SOC are a classic case of roll-up pleas.  It is defective, confusing and cannot be allowed.  Theyare struck out and the proposed amendment by way of ASOC is refused.  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffsâ claim for inducement of breach of contract based on the two paragraphs is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  That is, however, not the end of the matter.  In Â§Â§ 73 and 74 of the SOC, the plaintiffs pleaded that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had induced breaches of contract and obligations by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  Although there is room for improvement, the pleas are sufficient enough to survive a striking out application.</p>    <p class="heading">I.   Breach of contract and obligations by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The thrust of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffsâ case is that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, while still employed, actively participated in the launch of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, a business rival.  That constituted a breach of their employment contract and obligations, fiduciary and equitable.  Thepleas concerned are Â§69(1) to (4) of the SOC and Â§69(6) of the ASOC for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant; Â§70(1) to (4) of the SOC and Â§71(7) of the ASOC for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant; Â§71(1) to (6) of the SOC, Â§71(8) of the ASOC, Â§72 (without the 3<sup>rd</sup> sentence which has been struck out of the SOC) for the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant; and Â§75(1) to (3) of the SOC for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.  They are all proper pleas and cannot be struck out.  The proposed amendments to these paragraphs are also allowed.</p>    <p class="heading">J.

Briefly, the requirements in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 177</a> are two fold :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the author satisfies the qualifications requirements in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s178.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 178</a>, that is, if the author is an individual author, he was at the material time an individual domiciled or resident or having a rightof abode in Hong Kong or elsewhere; or if the author was a body corporate, it was incorporated under the law of any country, territoryor area; and</p>        <p class="quote">(b) the work was published in Hong Kong or elsewhere.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  As to ownership of copyright, the author of a work is generally the first owner : <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13.</a>  However, where a work is made by an employee in the ordinary course of his employment, his employer is the first owner subject toany agreement to the contrary : <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(1).</a></p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Copyright in a work is infringed by a person who without the licence of the copyright owner does, or authorizes another to do, anyof the acts restricted by the copyright as defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)</a> : <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(2).</a>  They are usually referred to as primary infringements.

The Defendants have infringed Total Lubricants HKâs copyright.</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">  <b><u>PARTICULARS</u></b></p>            <p class="quote">(1)   By copying or removing information which is the property of Total Lubricants HK and Total Lubrifiants to the USB devices identifiedin Appendix 3 without licence from Total Lubricants HK.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)   By copying the copyright works identified in Appendix 4 without licence from Total Lubricants HK by sending copies to theirpersonal email address on various dates between 12 and 19 June 2008.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)   <u>By copying or removing the copyright works identified in Appendix 1 without licence from Total Lubricants HK.</u></p>            <p class="quote">Total Lubricants HK is unable to give further particulars of the full extent of the Defendantsâ infringement of copyright untilafter disclosure.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">79. The Defendants have in their possession, power, custody or control infringing copies of the Total Lubricants HKâs copyrightworks <u>and the Defendants know or have reason to believe that they are infringing copies of Total Lubricants HKâs copyright works</u>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The copyright works are identified in Appendixes 3, 4 and 1.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Appendix 3 is a table of USB devices connected to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs computers.  But it is not clear what exactly the devices contained.  Ms Ismail frankly conceded that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff does not know.  Given the concession, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff cannot possibly plead and prove the type of work contained in Appendix 3, whether it was original work and who the authorwas.  In short, they cannot plead and prove subsistence of copyright.  On this point alone, any copyright claim based on Appendix3 simply cannot get off the ground.  Â§78(1) is struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Contained in Appendix 4 is a list of emails with attachments.  Ms Ismail said they are literal works.  But there is no plea as towho the author was and whether they were original works.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff has therefore failed to plead and prove subsistence of copyright.  Further, absent any plea of who the author was, theallegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff owned the copyright cannot stand.  Â§78(2) is struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  An additional difficulty relates to infringement arose in Â§78(2).  It is alleged that all the defendants had infringed the copyrightby copying the works without licence by sending copies to their personal email address.  This contradicts Appendix 4 in which onlythe 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants were alleged to have committed the acts complained of.  Further, as rightly pointed out by Mr Barlow, the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants, as corporate entities, did not have any personal email accounts.  So even if the copyright claim can be maintained againstthe 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, no possible claim can be pleaded against the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants.  Â§78(2) must be struck out against the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants in any event.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Appendix 1 contains a list of user guides to the BOS system.  They are literary works.  Â§35 of the ASOC alleged that âduringthe course of his employment by [the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff], [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] and/or various other employees of [the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff] wrote the original literary works identified in Appendix 1â.  The reference to other employees is objectionable.  Theyhave to be identified.  Further, the proposed amendment in Â§78(3) of the ASOC has failed to plead the qualification requirementfor the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the other employees in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s178.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 178</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>.  In other words, it has failed to plead sufficiently for the subsistence of copyright in the literary works identified in Appendix1.  Lastly, removal of copyright works <i>per se</i> did not constitute an infringement.  Because of these deficiencies, the proposed amendment is not properly and exactly formulatedand does not constitute a full and complete plea of a reasonable cause of action for copyright infringement.  The proposed amendmentin terms of Â§78(3) is refused.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Â§79 of the SOC dealt with secondary infringement.  That paragraph in its original form stopped short of pleading knowledge, anessential element of secondary infringement.  It also failed to include another essential element, which is the plea that the defendantspossess the infringing copies for the purpose of and in the course of trade or business.  As such, it is liable to be struck out. Knowledge is now supplied by the proposed amendment.  But the second essential element is still lacking.  The proposed amendmentdoes not cure the defect.  Â§79 in its amended form remains to be objectionable.  The proposed amendment cannot be allowed.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  For these reasons, Â§Â§78 and 79 of the SOC fail to disclose any reasonable cause of action for copyright infringement.

The claimfor copyright infringement is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">K.  Conspiracy</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Finally, I come to conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.  There are two kindsof conspiracy :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) an âunlawful meansâ conspiracy in which the participants combine together to perform acts which are themselves unlawful; and</p>        <p class="quote">(2) a combination to perform acts which, although not themselves <i>per se</i> unlawful, are done with the sole or predominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See <i>Bullen &amp; Leake</i>, Â§51-01 at p.855.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Here the plaintiffs only relied on the unlawful means conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The plaintiffs must plead and prove the following necessary elements :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) a combination or agreement between two or more individuals;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) an intent to injure;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) pursuant to which combination or agreement and with that intention certain acts were carried out; and</p>        <p class="quote">(4) resulting loss and damage.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See <i>Bullen &amp; Leake</i>, Â§51-02, <i>supra</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  The plaintiffs pleaded in Â§Â§83 to 87 (as amended by the ASOC) thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â83.  In the premises, from early 2008, Ms Huot conspired with Mr Dujean, Ms Nehme, Dr Rao and Mr Ramesh on behalf of Gulf Oil Internationalto set up GOML to compete with the Plaintiffs, and take their customers, staff and confidential information, and keep these actionssecret from the Plaintiffs.</p>        <p class="quote">84.    The conspiracy involved the use of unlawful means, <u>including but not limited to</u> <s>namely the</s> breaches of contractual, fiduciary and equitable duties <u>as owed to Total Lubricants HK and/or Total Singapore</u> set out above <u>(at paragraphs 69 to 82 above) and/or the solicitation, inducement and procurement of the Departing Staff to breach such contractualfiduciary and equitable duties</u>.</p>        <p class="quote">85.    From March 2008, Mr de Chanterac joined the conspiracy.</p>        <p class="quote">86.    <b><s>The Plaintiffs f</s><u>F</u></b>urther <b><s>believe that</s>:</b></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) from <b><u>in or about</u></b> April 2008 Mr Lambert joined the conspiracy;</p>            <p class="quote">(2) from <b><u>in or about</u></b> June 2008 Ms Joniaux joined the conspiracy; and</p>            <p class="quote">(3) From the time it ceased to be dormant, namely 10 June 2008, GOML joined the conspiracy.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">87. As the Defendants appreciated that it would do, the conspiracy has harmed the Plaintiffs and caused them loss and damage.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  In Â§84, the unlawful means included some other matters not particularized.  That is objectionable.  For the breaches of dutiesidentified, no reliance can now be placed on those which have been dismissed above.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  More importantly, whether it is in the SOC or in the ASOC, the plaintiffs have failed to plead the intent to injure and that theacts complained of were carried out with that intent.  On this ground alone, no reasonable cause of action is disclosed. </p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Â§Â§83 to 87 of the SOC are struck out.  The proposed amendment by way of the ASOC is refused.  The claim for conspiracy is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">L.  Abuse of process</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  This ground can be disposed of very briefly.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  On the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs claims against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, which survive the striking our application, are an abuse of process.  The claims cannot be struck out on this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  As against the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> defendants, all the claims against them have been struck out.  It is not strictly necessary to deal with their complaints on abuseof process.  Just for completeness, I will say that the evidence before the court is not sufficient.</p>    <p class="heading">M. Orders and further directions</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  In light of my rulings on the striking out and amendment applications, the only causes of action that remain are breach of employmentcontract and fiduciary obligations as against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants (Â§62 above) and inducement of breach of contract as against the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant (Â§61 above).  The paragraphs on remedies and relief in the SOC that concern them should be re-visited.  Those parts whichare not related to the above causes of action are struck out.  All the claims against the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> defendants having been dismissed, all the paragraphs on remedies and relief in the SOC which concern them are struck out.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff ceased to be a proper party to these proceedings.  I order the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff to cease to be a party pursuant to Order 15, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2(a)</a> of the Rules of the High Court and all its references in the SOC be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The order on the striking out and amendment applications needs to be carefully drafted to fully and accurately incorporate all myrulings.  I will direct the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants, in consultation with the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, to prepare a draft order and serve it on the plaintiffs for their comment within 21 days from the date of this Decision,the plaintiffs to give their comment within 14 days thereafter, and the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants to submit the draft order to court (together with the plaintiffsâ comment, if any) for approval within 14 days thereafter.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The defendants have substantially succeeded in the striking out and amendment applications.  I will make an order <i>nisi</i> that they shall have the costs of those applications, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Finally, I will direct the parties to submit to court within 21 days from today a set of proposed directions as agreed, or failingwhich their respective proposal, for the future conduct of the stay application.  The costs of the stay application are reservedfor the time being.</p>    <p>  </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">  (J.
