In summary the Plaintiff says that until discovery and/or interrogatories, they rely on the procurementof Hwa Yang Printing Company Limited and/or an other or others unknown to print the packaging which was provided to the Plaintiff'sinvestigator on 4th February 1991 and exhibited as "SMV2" to the affidavit of Steven McVeigh and the packaging for the Miss Americadolls referred to in paragraph 10 which I have set out above.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The packaging relied on is a box for the Miss America dolls. The printing thereon made plain that it is a product of Kenner, a divisionof the Tonka Corporation, the Defendant. It contains the statement on the side of the box: "Clothes also fit BARBIE and other 11Â½"fashion dolls". The back of the box referred to the following:</p>    <ul>        <li>    1991 The Miss America Organization with the C sign (indicating that that organization had the copyright in Miss America).</li>    </ul>    <ul>        <li>    BARBIE is a registered trade mark of Mattel Inc. (the Plaintiff).</li>    </ul>    <ul>        <li>   Kenner, a division of Tonka Corporation (the Defendant).</li>    </ul>    <ul>        <li>   Made in China.</li>    </ul>    <p>On opening the box, one of the inside flaps set out the telephone number and the address of Kenner Products Consumer Affairs Departmentto whom consumer complaints could be addressed. The doll itself bears the marking (C) Kenner 1991.</p>    <p><u>Service of writ</u></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Pursuant to the ex parte order, the Plaintiff served the writ in the United States on the Defendant. As deposed to in the affidavitof Nancy Dassoff sworn on 21st March 1991, service was effected on 21st March 1991 by serving Robin Moore at CT Corporation Systemin Los Angeles, said to be the designated agent for service of process in California on the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> CT Corporation System in California then transmitted on 21st March 1991 the documents via Federal Express, a courier service, toJoseph Joyce, General Counsel of the Defendant at 300 South Highway 169 STE 500 St. Louis Park, Minnesota 55426. The documents wereduly received there. This was the address specified in the ex parte order. This is evident from the Service of Process TransmittalForm exhibited to the affidavit of Michael Davis sworn on 26th April 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> On 30th May 1991, there was a further attempt at service on the Defendant at the address specified in the ex parte order.</p>    <p><u>The Defendant's Challenge</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> By its summons filed on 29th April 1991, the Defendant sought to challenge the jurisdiction. The orders sought are:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>1.    An Order that the Writ or its service be set aside.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>2.    Further or in the alternative, a declaration that the Writ has not been duly served upon the Defendant.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>3.    Further or in the alternative that the ex parte order be discharged.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>4.    Further or in the alternative, a declaration that in the circumstances the Court had no jurisdiction over the Defendant in respectof the subject matter of the claim or the relief or remedy sought.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>The grounds relied on are:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(A)    No or no good arguable cause of action against the Defendant has been put forward.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(B)    Further or alternatively, the Defendant has done nothing unlawful within the jurisdiction.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The Defendant sought to amend the summons by adding two further grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(C)    That the purported service upon the Defendant of the writ was irregular in that it failed to comply with the ex parte order.(The rest of this ground as set out in the summons to amend was not pursued.)</p>            <p>(D)    Further or alternatively, the ex parte order was obtained on affidavit evidence which was misleading, inaccurate and untrue.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><u>Application to amend summons</u></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. A. Rogers Q.C. for the Plaintiff did not object to the amendment introducing Ground (D). But he objected to the introductionof Ground (C). He submitted that the point in (C) is a thoroughly bad one and the Court should not grant leave to amend. He was contentthat arguments on it should be addressed de bene esse and this course was followed. If the point is plainly and obviously bad, Iaccept that the Court should not permit the amendment. But in my judgment, the point sought to be raised in (C) is not in that category.Whether it succeeds or not is another matter which I shall come to presently. The Plaintiff can point to no prejudice resulting fromthe amendment. Accordingly, I allow the amendment introducing Ground (C) and also Ground (D).</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The Defendant's summons also sought further or alternatively for an order striking out the Statement of Claim. This was not pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. A. Sakhrani Q.C. for the Defendant presented the present challenge on three grounds: (1) The purported service on 21st March1991 was bad and the Writ has not been duly served. (2) The ex parte order was obtained with misleading evidence (3) No good arguablecase has been shown.</p>    <p><u>Purported service on 21st March 1991</u></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Sakhrani made clear that his challenge is confined to the purported service on 21st March 1991. That was the one that had beeneffected when the Defendant took out its summons on 29th April 1991. The amendment to the summons (which dates back to the date ofthe summons) does not affect the matter. The validity of the second purported service on 30th March 1991 is not before me.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Sakhrani's submission is a simple one. The ex parte order specified a particular address in Minnesota for service on the Defendant.The Plaintiff did not effect service at that address. Service was purportedly effected on the Defendant's agent in California. Mr.Sakhrani submitted that the order was therefore not complied with and the purported service was bad. He drew attention to 35 Atkins(2nd ed.) Form 66 and Chitty &amp; Jacob (21st ed.) Form 55 where precedents for such an order referred expressly to an address inthe country or elsewhere in that country. The words "or elsewhere" were omitted here. Mr. Sakhrani says that service must be effectedat the address specified. The alternative "or elsewhere" was not permitted by this order.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> There is no doubt that the Defendant received the Writ at the address in Minnesota specified in the ex parte Order shortly afterservice on its agent in California, as is evident from the Service of Process Transmittal Form I have referred to. That transmissionwas between the Defendant's agent and the Defendant and did not constitute service by the Plaintiff on the Defendant at the Minnesotaaddress.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> As Mr. Sakhrani acknowledges, the point is a technical one. But is it a good point?</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In my judgment, it is not. I agree with Mr. Rogers that the proper interpretation of the ex parte order is that it does not meanthat service must be effected only at the Minnesota address. In essence, the order grants leave to the Plaintiff to issue the writand to serve it out of the jurisdiction. The reference to the address was, in my judgment, a reference to where the Defendant maybe served, not where he must be served. Although the word "or elsewhere" were not present, my interpretation of the order is thatit permitted service in the USA on an address other than that specified.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Rogers also sought to rely on Order 2 rule (1) which provides that where there is a failure to comply with the rules, that failureshall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings. In my judgment, that provision has no application heresince what is complained of is not a failure to comply with the rules but (if my conclusion above is wrong) a failure to comply withan Order.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Accordingly, in my judgment, the service on 21st March 1991 in California was good service on the Defendant.</p>    <p><u>Good arguable case</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I shall consider this aspect first. The Plaintiff must establish a good arguable case. This means more than a mere prima facie casealthough the Court will not at this stage require proof of the plaintiff's case to its satisfaction. See the commentary at 11/1/6at p.86 of the White Book.</p>    <p><u>Copyright claim</u></p>    <p>Import by the Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I shall deal first with Mr. Rogers' primary case. He submitted that the Plaintiff has established a good arguable case that the Defendantor its alter ego or agent (who was authorised by the Defendant) has imported the Miss America dolls into Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The knowledge prescribed by section 5(2) is an essential ingredient of the cause of action. For present purposes, this is not anissue since Mr. Sakhrani does not suggest that the Plaintiff has failed to make out a good arguable case on knowledge on the partof the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I shall summarise the affidavit evidence before me. It was mainly based on materials gathered by the investigators instructed bythe Defendant, Business Risks International (Asia) Limited ("Business Risks").</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The Defendant is a substantial toy company. One of its divisions is the Kenner Products Division. The packaging of the Miss Americadolls make plain that it is a product of Kenner.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The Defendant has a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. This is a Hong Kong limited company by the name of Tonka Kenner ParkerToys (HK) Limited ("TPK"). It operates from premises at 10th Floor of the Peninsula Centre.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The evidence referred to Mr. Patrick Ng of TPK telling Investigator A that "TPK acted as a buying office for the Defendant. All businesstransactions were handled by the Defendant and nobody at TPK has authority to deal with customers. Mr. Ng however suggested thatInvestigator A contact Oriental Trading Company, the exclusive agent of the Defendant" (See paragraph 9 of Mr. McVeigh's affidavitsworn on 14th March 1991). Oriental is the exclusive distributor of Kenner products in Hong Kong. In my judgment, there is a goodarguable case that this evidence establish the following: (i) TPK acted as a buying office for the Defendant (i.e. buying productsfor the Defendant). (ii) All business transactions were handled by the Defendant. This is a reference to transactions buying productsand means in effect that orders for products were placed by the Defendant. This could not refer to transactions of sales of the Defendant'sproducts to customers since this was evidently not dealt with by the Defendant but by Oriental as its exclusive distributor in HongKong. (iii) As far as sales of the Defendant's products are concerned, it has no authority to deal with customers wishing to buythe Defendant's products. Oriental is the exclusive distributor for the Defendant's products in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The Miss America dolls in question including its clothing and accessories were manufactured in China by Jetta Company Limited ("Jetta").Jetta operates from premises at Kwai Chung. It has three factories in China. Jetta manufactures the dolls in question on an OEM basis(Original Equipment Manufacturing) at its Sam Yuen Lee Jetta Manufactory. Production there in 1991 was expected to be devoted exclusivelyto the manufacture of Miss America dolls and that production averaged 40,000 to 50,000 dolls per day.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> "All the orders were received from Kenner" for the dolls. They were handled by Mr. T.S. Wong, a director of Jetta's HK office. Inlate February/early March 1991, Mr. Paul Eamon of the Defendant had visited the Sam Yuen Lee Factory and told Miss Cheng of thatfirtery that Kenner had signed a contract for the production of one million dolls by Jetta and a further contract for another twomillion would be signed in the near future. (See paragraph 17 of Mr. McVeigh's report). In my judgment, this establishes that theorders were placed by the Defendant with Jetta.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The moulds for the dolls were at the Same Yuen Lee Factory. They were made in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The packaging was printed by a company called "Wah Yeung". It appears from the telephone directory that a company using that nameis Hwa Yang Printing Co. Ltd.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Prior to 1st March 1991, the dolls were transported from that factory by road to Jetta's premises in Hong Kong where they were thenshipped by Jetta from Hong Kong to the USA.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> After 1st March 1991, the factory was instructed to ship the dolls from Whampoa Dock in Guangzhou City to USA. The instruction camefrom "Kenner's HK representative office" (See paragraph 16 of Mr. McVeigh's March 1991 report exhibited to his affidavit sworn on22nd June 1991). I find that this was a reference to TPK.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> As far as shipments after 1st March 1991 are concerned, the American President Lines was used. (Mr. Louis Tang of that company hassworn an affidavit dealing with this matter.) The dolls were loaded at Whampoa onto the Eagle Comet or the Eagle Bay. They are smallvessels sailing between Whampoa in China and Kaoshiung in Taiwan via Hong Kong. These vessels do not sail to the USA. The vesselscarrying the shipments transit through Hong Kong without loading, unloading or transferring cargo in Hong Kong. They complete theformalities required of all transit vessels and this can take from between 20 minutes to 3 hours. The port clearance certificatethat has to be completed is a simple one. (See the sample exhibited to the affidavit of Mr. Evans). The vessels then sail to Taiwan.For political reasons, the vessels do not sail from China to Taiwan direct and have to transit through Hong Kong. On arrival in Taiwan,the cargo would be unloaded there. The cargo destined for the USA is put onboard much larger and faster vessels such as the PresidentAdams.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> As far as the shipment of container APLU 702244 020 8578 carried aboard Eagle Comet on 8th March 1991 is concerned, (the shipmentpleaded in the Statement of Claim), there was only one bill of lading in relation to the shipment. It is known as a "through" billof lading covering a transfer of goods from one ship to another. It shows TPK as the shipper and Kenner Products as the consignee.It shows that goods were loaded on board the Eagle Comet at Whampoa to the discharged at Cincinnati Ohio and that the consignmentwas due to be onward routed abroad President Adams V/025-1 Kao which stands for Kaoshiung Taiwan; i.e. the container would be transferredto the President Adams at Kaoshiung Taiwan.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff first came to know of the "Miss America" dolls in early February 1991. Mr. Jim Kipling (an in-house attorney of theKenner Division of the Defendant) telephoned Judy Willis (Assistant General Counsel of the Plaintiff) to inform her that Kenner wasabout to introduce a doll called "Miss America" based on a licence from the owner of the "Miss America" trade mark and offered tosend samples to her to review. This was taken up and samples were sent to the Plaintiff. In mid-February 1991 samples of the "MissAmerica" dolls heads were on display for sale at the New York Toy Show. The Plaintiff then decided to instruct Business Risks toinvestigate the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Mr. Rogers urged me to take an overall view of the evidence. In his Skeleton Argument, he set out the matters relied on (which Ido not propose to repeat here) and concluded his case thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As such it is the Plaintiff's case that the Defendant was the party which was responsible for the whole operation starting with conceptionof the product, getting the MISS AMERICA licence, creating the detailed instructions as to manufacture ordering the manufacture ofthe goods and concluding with the sale in the United States. All the wholly owned subsidiary was doing was acting as the true alterego of the Defendant, a true agent and the Plaintiff says that it has ample justification to make that assertion. Therefore it hasa good arguable case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr. Sakhrani submits that the Plaintiff has failed to make out a good arguable case that the Defendant imported or that TPK was itsalter ego or agent.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In deciding whether the Plaintiff has made out a good arguable case that the Defendant or its alter ego or agent had imported, theposition before and that after 1st March 1991 should be separately considered.</p>    <p><u>Prior to 1st March 1991</u></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Prior to 1st March 1991, the dolls were transported from Jetta's Sam Yuen Lee factory by road to Jetta's premises in Hong Kong wherethey were then shipped by Jetta from Hong Kong to the USA. The import into Hong Kong was plainly by Jetta. There is no suggestionthat Jetta was the alter ego or agent of the Defendant. The fact that the Defendant had placed the orders with Jetta and it was pursuantto those orders that Jetta manufactured the goods, imported them into Hong Kong and then shipped them to USA does not, in my judgment,make the Defendant the importer or Jetta the alter ego or agent of the Defendant when it (Jetta) imported the goods. The Plaintiffhas failed to establish a good arguable case that the Defendant had imported the dolls into Hong Kong prior to 1st March 1991.</p>    <p><u>After 1st March 1991</u></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> After 1st March 1991, the dolls were transported by vessel from Whampoa to Taiwan via Hong Kong and then transferred at Taiwan toanother vessel for the USA. Such a shipment was covered by a through bill of lading. The vessel transit through Hong Kong, withoutloading, unloading or transferring cargo in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Two questions arise. First, was there any import within section 5(2). Secondly, if there was any import, was it by the Defendantor its alter ego or agent?</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Mr. Sakhrani submitted that there was no import within section 5(2) in these circumstances. He relied on the meaning of import inthe <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a> and Regulations which specifically excluded cargo in transit.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In my judgment, the word "import" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> should be given its ordinary meaning. It simply means bringing into Hong Kong. That being so, cargo in transit such as the dollshere was imported into Hong Kong within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2).</a> It may be different where cargo came into Hong Kong involuntarily, for example, as a result of hijack or poor weather conditions.But here it came into Hong Kong for a deliberate reason. It had to transit through Hong Kong since for political reasons, vesselscannot sail direct from China to Taiwan.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> In my judgment, the definition of import in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a> is of no assistance. Its purpose is to regulate and control the import and export of articles into and from Hong Kong generally.It is not concerned merely with copyright.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Mr. Sakhrani referred me to the Copyright (Hong Kong) Orders in Council 1972 and 1979 extending the Copyright Act to Hong Kong. Therewas a reference to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a>. In applying the Act, section 22(7) was substituted by a provision which deemed the importation of any copy of a work which is prohibitedby the Act a contravention of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/60" class="autolink_findacts">Import and Export Ordinance</a> for the purposes only of provisions therein providing for forfeiture. In my judgment, this does not indicate that the Ordinance isof assistance in construing the Act. In effect, only the enforcement provisions by forfeiture in the Ordinance were incorporatedfor a particular purpose. But if any assistance could be gained from the definition in the Ordinance, I agree with Mr. Rogers thatit supports the conclusion I have come to on its ordinary meaning since cargo in transit would have been included but for its specificexclusion. My conclusion of its ordinary meaning is also supported by the definition of import in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> which does not apply.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Having concluded that the dolls were imported into Hong Kong after 1st March 1991, I turn to consider the question import by whom.In my judgment, the Plaintiff has established a good arguable case that it was the Defendant acting through TPK that imported thedolls in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> I base this conclusion on the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    The orders for the dolls were placed by the Defendant with Jetta. The Defendant was therefore the purchaser and Jetta was theseller under these orders.</p>        <p>(2)    The "through" bill of lading showed TPK as the shipper and the Defendant as the consignee.</p>        <p>(3)    Since the Defendant was the purchaser placing the orders, TPK in shipping the goods and in directing Jetta to ship in thisway must have acted with the authority of and as the Defendant's agent.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Mr. Rogers in inviting me to take an overall view submitted that I should regard TPK as the Defendant's alter ego or agent for <u>all</u> purposes in relation to the dolls. I do not accept this submission. TPK was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Defendant. It was theDefendant's buying agent and was described as its Hong Kong representative office. The words "agent" and "representative" here arenot used in the strict legal sense but in a commercial sense. As the Defendant would be selling the dolls under its Kenner name,it must have been instrumental and intimately concerned with the whole process. In my judgment, these matters do not establish agood arguable case that TPK was the Defendant's puppet for <u>all</u> purposes. One has to look at the particular act in question and the evidence relating to it. As I have concluded, in acting as shipperin bringing the dolls into Hong Kong albeit for transit which I have held amount to import, TPK was acting with the Defendant's authorityand as its agent.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Accordingly, I hold that the Plaintiff has established a good arguable case that the Defendant acting through TPK imported the dollsin breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> after 1st March 1991.</p>    <p><u>Procurement by the Defendant</u></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Mr. Rogers addressed a subsidiary submission. He submitted that even if import into Hong Kong was not by the Defendant or its alterego or agent but by somebody else (e.g. Jetta) the import by such importer was procured by the Defendant. That renders the Defendantliable.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> As I have held there is a good arguable case for breach of copyright in respect of the post 1st March 1991 shipments, it is not necessaryto consider this subsidiary submission in relation to such shipments. I shall only consider it in relation to the import prior to1st March 1991 which was made by Jetta.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Mr. Sakhrani submitted that the Plaintiff has not pleaded a complete cause of action on procurement and that in any event a goodarguable case has not been made out. He submitted that the Plaintiff must establish a good arguable case of the Defendant procuringand sharing a common design with the importer (Jetta) that the infringement shall take place. He relied on the principles discussedby Lord Templeman in <u>CBS Songs v. Amstrad</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20AC%201013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 A.C. 1013</a> at 1056-8. He submitted that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> knowledge is required of both Jetta (the importer) and the Defendant (the procurer) if the Defendant is to be liable for procurement.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> As I understand this part of the case, I am concerned with the tort of procurement (by the Defendant) of breach of copyright (byJetta).</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Applying the principles discussed by Lord Templeman in <u>CBS Songs v. Amstrad</u> at 1057G-1058H, what has to be established on the good arguable test is that the Defendant procured Jetta to import into Hong Kongand that they shared a common design that <u>infringement</u> by import by Jetta into Hong Kong shall take place. (I have underlined the word infringement for emphasis.) In my judgment, sinceknowledge is an essential ingredient of the cause of action for breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a>, there would only be a common design that <u>infringement</u> shall take place if both the Defendant and Jetta had the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> The Defendant placed the orders with Jetta. Prior to 1st March 1991, they were shipped to the Defendant in USA by Jetta from HongKong after they have been brought into Hong Kong by Jetta. It should be inferred from the fact that the Defendant placed the orderswith Jetta that this route of transport was decided on and agreed to by the Defendant and Jetta. That in my judgment, is sufficientto constitute procurement by the Defendant of import by Jetta.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Although the Plaintiff has established a good arguable case that the Defendant had procured Jetta to import the dolls into Hong Kongprior to 1st March 1991, in my judgment, the Plaintiff has failed to make out a good arguable case against the Defendant on the tortof procurement. Knowledge on the part of Jetta is required. But this is neither pleaded nor established by the evidence. Mr. Rogerssays that such a plea of knowledge could easily be made and established. But I must deal with the case as it is before me.</p>    <p><u>Trade marks claim</u></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> The Plaintiff's case is that the Defendant has infringed its registered trade marks by procuring the printing in Hong Kong of thepackaging in question which bears inter alia the words "clothes also fit Barbie". The particulars refer to procuring the printingby Hwa Yang Printing Company Limited in Hong Kong. I shall assume for present purposes that if the Defendant had procured the printingof such packaging, it would be liable for direct infringement of the trade marks or for the tort of procuring infringement of thetrade marks by the printer. I have to decide whether the Plaintiff has testablished a good arguable case that the Defendant has procuredthe printing of the packaging in Hong Kong by Hwa Yang Printing Company Limited.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> In my judgment, the Plaintiff has failed to establish such a good arguable case. My reasons are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    The evidence establish that both before and after 1st March 1991, the process of packaging was carried out in China and notin Hong Kong. Jetta manufactured the dolls in China. Prior to 1st March 1991, Jetta transported them to Jetta's premises in HongKong for shipment to USA. No packaging was done in Hong Kong. After 1st March 1991, they were put on board the vessel in Whampoa.Again, no packaging was done in Hong Kong.</p>        <p>(2)    It follows from (1) that the packaging printed in Hong Kong must have been transported to Jetta's Sam Yuen Lee Factory forthe dolls to be packed there.</p>        <p>(3)    The Defendant placed the orders with Jetta. They must have been for the purchase of the packaged dolls to be imported intothe USA.</p>        <p>(4)    I infer from the above matters that it was Jetta who placed the orders for the printing of the packaging in Hong Kong. Theorders placed by the Defendant must have required delivery of the packaged dolls by Jetta. Jetta had to arrange for the printingof the packaging to fulfil those orders. Jetta could have arranged for such printing in China, Hong Kong, Macao or elsewhere. Jettachose to place the orders for the printing of the packaging to be carried out in Hong Kong.</p>        <p>(5)    I accept that the Defendant must have approved the sample for the packaging for its orders with Jetta. Jetta had to deliverdolls in the packaging as per the approved sample. But in my judgment, it does not follow that the Defendant procured the printingin Hong Kong. There is no evidence to suggest that the Defendant obliged Jetta to get the printing done in Hong Kong. It could havearranged for such printing to be carried out elsewhere as per the approved sample. In the absence of such evidence, the Defendantcould not be said to have procured the printing in Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Having regard to my conclusion that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a good arguable case that the Defendant procured the printingof the packaging in Hong Kong, it is not necessary for me to express a concluded view on the other points on the trade mark claimthat were canvassed before me. However, in deference to the arguments presented, I would make the following observations.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> As far as the Plaintiff's paper products mark is concerned, Miss Tam for the Defendant submitted that a good arguable case of infringementhas not been made out. The reference to "BARBIE" in the phrase complained of "Clothes also fit BARBIE ..." was a reference to "BARBIE"the doll or the proprietor of BARBIE doll. It was not a reference to the paper packaging containing the doll or the Plaintiff inits capacity as proprietor of the paper products mark. She submitted relying on <u>Pompadour Laboratories Limited v. Stanley Frazer</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20RPC%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) RPC 7</a> that such use is not within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(1)(b).</a> The expression therein "reference to some person having the right ... as the proprietor" of a mark does not mean reference to a personwho happens to be proprietor. The intention must be to refer to that person as the proprietor of the mark in question i.e. the paperproducts mark. Here this was not the case. Nor is it within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(1)(a).</a> Mr. Rogers relying on the judgment of Lord Greene in <u>Bismag v. Amblins (Chemists) Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2057%20RPC%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 57 RPC 209</a> submitted that the exclusive right conferred in the first part of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(1)</a> is a wide one, much wider than that in the previous law. For my part, Miss Tam's submissions have considerable force and I doubtif the Plaintiff's paper products trade mark has been infringed.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> I also doubt whether the Plaintiff has established a good arguable case on infringement of the Plaintiff's dolls mark. Again I seeconsiderable fore in Miss Tam's submission that the use is within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(3)(b).</a> We are concerned with dolls' clothes on the Miss America dolls which are suitable for Barbie dolls and other 11Â½ fashion dolls.It appears to me they are goods adapted to be accessory to Barbie dolls and that the reference to "Barbie" in the phrase in questionis reasonably necessary to indicate that the goods are so adapted. Further, neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of theBarbie mark is to indicate otherwise than in accordance with the fact a connexion in the course of trade between any person and thegoods.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Miss Tam also submitted that printing a mark is not of itself infringing use unless (i) the mark which is printed is subsequentlyput into infringing use and (ii) such infringing purpose is manifest to the printer. I doubt if this submission is correct. Printinga mark is prima facie a use of the mark infringing the exclusive right in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(1).</a> Unless it is shown that such use is an authorised one, there would appear to be an infringement of that right. Miss Tam relied onJ<u>ameson v. Johnston</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%2018%20RPC%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) 18 RPC 259.</a> But that case turned on very special facts.</p>    <p><u>Misleading evidence</u></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Paragraph (2) of the particulars in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim referred to the importation into Hong Kong of the MissAmerica dolls in container No. APLU 702244 020 8578 on board the "Eagle Comet No.49" which arrived in Hong Kong on or about 9th March1991 which container was then transferred to the "President Adams" destined for New York via Kaoshiung Taiwan.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> The evidence the Plaintiff put before the Court on the ex parte application supported this allegation. Paragraph 21 of Mr. McVeigh'saffidavit a draft of which was before the Court dealt with this. He set out what Miss Fung of American President Lines said to InvestigatorB on the telephone on 11th March 1991 about the shipment of this container. It was loaded on board "the Eagle Comet No.49" whichleft Whampoa Dock Guangzhou on 8th marh 1991 and arrived in Hong Kong on 9th March 1991. The container with its cargo was transferredto "The President Adams - Voyage 25" which was destined for New York via Kaoshiung Taiwan. Separate bills of lading were used forthe shipment from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to New York.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> In fact, this evidence was incorrect. The true position was that the container containing the dolls in question was not transferredto another vessel in Hong Kong. The vessel only transited through Hong Kong. No cargo was loaded, unloaded or transferred in HongKong. It then sailed to Taiwan where the cargo was transferred to the other vessel destined for USA. Because of political reasons,the vessel could not sail from China to Taiwan direct. The whole shipment from China to USA was covered by one "through" bill oflading. This was the position for shipments after 1st March 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> The mistake came to be made in this way. Investigator B gave the details to Mr. McVeigh over the telephone on 11th march 1991. Mr.McVeigh then finished off his report. His affidavit was drafted on the basis of his report. The draft was approved by Mr. McVeighbefore it was put before the Court on the ex parte application. Mr. McVeigh sword his affidavit on 14th March 1991, the same dayas the ex parte order. Subsequently, Investigator B's report was put on the file. It did not occur to Mr. McVeigh to check InvestigatorB's report against his own report. It was only much later when the Defendant's evidence was filed to the effect that there was notranshipment in Hong Kong that Mr. McVeigh was asked to check this point by the Plaintiff's solicitors. On checking his file, hediscovered, presumably from Investigator B's report, that Miss Fung had in fact said that the container would be transferred in KaoshiungTaiwan and not Hong Kong and that his (Mr. McVeigh) own report and affidavit was incorrect. Mr. McVeigh says that he must have misheardwhat Investigator B said.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> So, the Court was given a mistaken picture on the facts relevant to the question of import into Hong Kong after 1st March 1991. Mr.Sakhrani submitted that the Court should discharge the ex parte order on this ground. Mr. Rogers submitted that the Court has a discretionin the matter and should not exercise it in the Defendant's favour. He pointed out that Business Risks are reputable and experiencedinvestigators and that the Plaintiff was not at fault. The Court should have regard to whether the Plaintiff has established a goodarguable case and if it has, it would be somewhat futile to discharge the ex parte order.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Re Mount Everest Investments Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%202%20HKLR%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 2 HKLR 175</a>, was concerned with an ex parte order appointing a provisional liquidator. The Court of Appeal summarised the principles thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(a)    The same principles are to be applied whether there has been material non-disclosure or material misstatements of facts andto all ex parte applications;</p>            <p class="quote">(b)    even if there has been material non-disclosure or misstatement of fact, the court nevertheless has a discretion whether ornot to set aside an ex parte order: this discretion will very rarely be exercised in favour of a person seeking to uphold the exparte order in cases of deliberate non-disclosure or misstatement of material facts and with great caution even in cases where suchnon-disclosure or misstatement was not deliberate; and</p>            <p class="quote">(c)    Normally a court will not assist a party to retain an advantage to which he was not entitled."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Thermax v. Scholt Industrial Glass Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20FSR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) FSR 289</a>, and <u>Wardle Fabrics Ltd. v. G. Myristes Ltd.</u> were both concerned with Anton Pillar orders. The test used in these decisions was that the Court must be fully ...(illegible) ofall facts that are relevant to the weighing operation which the Court has to make in deciding the point before it.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> That test was adopted by Hunter JA in <u>Wo Fung Making Factory Ltd. v. Sappi Kraft (Pty) Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%202%20HKLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 2 HKLR 346</a> at 357H-358G, a case concerned with an order under Order 11. Hunter JA said that the point of non-disclosure should be tested bylooking at the substance and the Court should start with the question of whether there is a good arguable case. That is the approachI have adopted here.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> The material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in dealing with the application before it. Materiality isto be decided by the Court. See <u>Brink's - MAT Ltd. v. Elcombe</u> (1988) 3 AE 188 at 192g. This was laid down in the classic case itself of <u>R v. Kensingtion Income Tax Commissioners</u> itself  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281917%29%201%20KB%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1917) 1 KB 486</a> at 504.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Here it is common ground that the mistaken evidence was not presented deliberately. I have a discretion to discharge or to allowthe order to stand.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> In my judgment, I should exercise the discretion by discharging the ex parte order. It follows from this that the service pursuantthereto was ineffective. The following considerations are particularly relevant in leading me to this conclusion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    The duty of full and frank disclosure on ex parte applications is a most important principle. The Court's power to dischargewhere this has not been observed is salutary and necessary for the Court's protection.</p>        <p>(2)    Although in a case where the misstatement was not deliberate, the Court has a discretion not to discharge, it is a discretionwhich has to be exercised with great caution.</p>        <p>(3)    The misstatement was not deliberate. Whilst everyone makes mistakes, this mistake of mishearing what Investigator B said abouther conversation with Mr. Fung on an important aspect of the investigation (and Mr. McVeigh must have known that this was an importantaspect) was to say the very least very unfortunate. It is a mistake which should not have been made.</p>        <p>(4)    I have concluded there is a good arguable case on the materials now before me for infringement of copyright in respect of thepost 1st March 1991 shipments. The misleading evidence related to such shipments. If my conclusion is right, the Court at the exparte stage would still have held there to be a good arguable case for the post 1st March 1991 shipments. But the correct test isnot whether the Court would still have decided the same way. The test is whether these are material facts relevant for the Courtto know in dealing with the exercise of its discretion under Order 11. There is no doubt that the misstatement related to facts whichwere most material to the ex parte application. It concerned whether there was import after 1st March 1991. This was a crucial questionfor claiming injunctive relief.</p>        <p>(5)    As far as the substance of the matter is concerned, the Plaintiff has failed to establish a good arguable case on its claimsfor infringement of copyright and trade mark, except for infringement of copyright for the post 1st March 1991 shipments. There isno good arguable case for infringement of copyright for shipments before 1st March 1991 or for infringement of trade mark. It isnot a case where the Plaintiff has established at the inter partes stage a good arguable case for all its claims.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> I would add that on the post 1st March 1991 shipments, the Plaintiff is presenting its case on a different basis at the inter partesstage (import although the goods were in transit) from that which was presented at the ex parte stage (import as goods unloaded andtransferred to another vessel in Hong Kong). The basis at the ex parte stage turned out to be unfounded. Apart from the misleadingevidence ground, I would also have discharged the ex parte order for this reason following the approach in <u>Parker v. Schuller</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%2017%20TLR%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) 17 TLR 299.</a> As was observed in that case, an application under Order 11 ought to be made with great care and looked it strictly.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> Accordingly, I make an order that the ex parte order be discharged. I make an order nisi for costs in favour of the Defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">Andrew Li, Q.C.</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">Deputy Judge of the High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. A Sakhrani Q.C. and Miss W.
