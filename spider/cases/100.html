The developer of the building was Shanghai Lucky Target Development Co. Ltd ("the Vendor"). TheirHong Kong sales agent was Lucky Target Property Agency Ltd ("the Hong Kong Agent"). The units were also available for sale in Shanghaithrough the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff was the purchaser of Unit 908 in the Property under a sale and purchase agreement dated 13 May 1996 ("the Sale andPurchase Agreement"). The Sale and Purchase Agreement was executed on behalf of the plaintiff at the offices of Messrs K.M. Lai &amp;Li ("Lai &amp; Li"), solicitors, whose three partners are the defendants. Mr Ma Siu Lam ("Ma"), the 3rd defendant, a China AppointedAttesting Officer ("CAAO"), attested the plaintiff's signatures. Following the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, a RealProperty Ownership Certificate (title deed) should be issued and registration of the plaintiff's interests in Unit 908 made on applicationto the relevant authority in Shanghai. The plaintiff signed a letter of authorisation, also dated 13 March 1996 ("Letter of Authorisation"),authorising the Vendor and Mr Tsui Foo Wing ("Tsui"), a lawyer in Shanghai, to undertake the registration and to obtain the titledeed. The Letter of Authorisation was also attested by Ma. No title deed in favour of the plaintiff was ever issued. Nor registrationundertaken. In February 2001, Unit 908 was sold by auction in Shanghai for the benefit of a creditor of the Vendor. The plaintiffsues the defendants for loss. The defendants' case is that they never acted for the plaintiff. They acted as the Vendor's solicitorsonly, and they acted as CAAO in attesting the plaintiff's signature. Further, that any legal costs paid to Lai &amp; Li by the plaintiffwere paid to them "as the Vendor's solicitors". In other words, even when acting as CAAO, Lai &amp; Li were acting for and on behalfof the Vendor only.</p>    <p class="heading">THE BACKGROUND</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Mr Baldwin Wong Kwok Learn ("Baldwin Wong"), who apparently controlled the plaintiff, signed a Memorandum of Sale dated 28 March1994 ("the Memorandum of Sale") to buy Unit 908 for HK$3,991,000 in his personal name. A deposit of 15% was paid. Incidentally, healso signed a Provisional Memorandum of Sale, also dated 28 March 1994, in relation to which an initial deposit of HK$100,000 waspaid. The significance of the Provisional Memorandum of Sale was not explored at the hearing. It does not matter whether the Memorandumof Sale was actually signed on 28 March 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> It is however relevant to note that in the Memorandum of Sale the Vendor's solicitors was stated to be Lai &amp; Li and the personto contact was Mr Lai Chak Sum ("C.S. Lai"), a conveyancing clerk.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Clause 2 of the Memorandum of Sale required the purchaser to "attend the appointed solicitors' office with the original of this Memorandumof Sale and his/her/its identity card or corporate documents on the appointed date to sign the pre-sale and purchase agreement. Theterms of the pre-sale and purchase agreement shall be determined by the Vendor".</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Clause 5 of the Memorandum of Sale also provided that "all solicitors' fees, government taxes/fees and all the expenses in connectionwith the purchase of the unit shall be borne by the purchasers". I believe this required the purchaser to pay solicitors' fees evenif they were incurred by the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> It is quite clear that the appointed solicitors were Lai &amp; Li. According to C.S. Lai, Lai &amp; Li were employed to perform theduties of CAAO in connection with the sale of units in the Property. The terms of the employment were agreed at a meeting betweena Mr Stephen Chung, a director of the Vendor, and the 1st defendant, Mr K.M. Lai ("K.M. Lai"). C.S. Lai was assigned by K.M. Laito handle this project. In the letter of appointment dated 4 March 1994 the appointee was stated to be Lai &amp; Li, although inthe body of the document it was K.M. Lai (also a CAAO) who was named as the appointee. It is also relevant to note :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ã... ç¾å§æé¦æ¸¯é»é¦æå¾å¸«ä¾ç§é¦æ¸¯æ³å¾è¾¦çè©²ååæ¿è¦è­é·å®åå¬æ­£æçºãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It seems that K.M. Lai was appointed in respect of the è¦è­ (attestation), é·å® (sale) and å¬æ­£ (notarization) "in accordancewith Hong Kong law". Although K.M. Lai or Lai &amp; Li were appointed to attest or notarise, there is no evidence what exactly itwas that K.M. Lai or Lai &amp; Li were required to attest or notarise. The appointment of K.M. Lai personally is consistent withthe evidence that a CAAO is appointed as a CAAO in his individual capacity and that in attesting documents he does so in his personalcapacity. I should also note that Lai &amp; Li were not described as CAAO in the Memorandum of Sale. In the sales brochures whichwere supplied to potential purchasers, under Schedule of Information, Lai &amp; Li were simply described as solicitors and notaries.There is no direct evidence whether Lai &amp; Lai were aware of the content of the sales brochures but undoubtedly Lai &amp; Li wereaware of the wording of the Memorandum of Sale. Since Lai &amp; Li were appointed by the Vendor prior to the sale in Hong Kong, Iwould expect Lai &amp; Li to be aware of the contents of the sales brochures.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> It is C.S. Lai's evidence that he attended one meeting between a representative of the Vendor and K.M. Lai. C.S. Lai's evidence didnot mention any fees. K.M. Lai did not give evidence. I do not know if there was any agreement between the Vendor and Lai &amp; Lior K.M. Lai on fees. I note that the Letter of Appointment dated 4 March 1994 is silent on any fees payable by the Vendor to Lai&amp; Li. According to C.S. Lai, Lai &amp; Li were also employed as the collecting agent of monies payable under the sale of unitsin the Property. However, it seems, but it is not entirely clear why, Lai &amp; Li were not required to collect payment in respectof every transaction attested by them.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> According to the evidence, since the units were being sold prior to completion of the Property, a pre-sale and purchase agreementwas required to be signed by the parties. When the Property was built, a formal sale and purchase agreement would have to be signed.The formal sale and purchase agreement would be on a printed form, which must be purchased from the relevant authority in Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It is common ground that as the transaction involved a sale of the Mainland property in Hong Kong, all documents signed in Hong Kongby Hong Kong residents have to be attested by CAAOs. Otherwise they would have no legal effect in the Mainland. Documents attestedby CAAOs in Hong Kong are covered by Article 67 of the Law of Civil Procedure of the People's Republic of China, an unofficial translationof which provides :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The People's court shall acknowledge the validity of legal acts, legal facts and documents that have been notarised through legalprocedure, except those that can be overturned by counter evidence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Since 22 February 1995, CAAOs have been regulated by ä¸­åå§æå¬è¨¼äºº(é¦æ¸¯)ç®¡çè¾¦æ³, issued by the Ministry of Justice.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> According to Mr T.C. Foo, a senior solicitor and a CAAO, and who gave expert evidence on the duties of and functions of CAAOs, CAAOswere first appointed in 1981. There were at that time only eight, there are now a total of 283 CAAOs. It is also his evidence thatCAAOs are appointed in their individual capacity and they attest documents as individuals.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In China, similar legal documents would have to be attested by Chinese notaries who are state officials. A Hong Kong resident whochooses to execute the sale and purchase agreement in the Mainland would have his signature attested by a Chinese notary.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> According to C.S. Lai, Lai &amp; Li were involved in the sale and purchase of a total of 128 units. Out of the 128 units, the purchasersof 127 of them signed the pre-sale and purchase agreements. However, some of these purchasers later signed the sale and purchaseagreements in the Mainland. Thus, whether a CAAO is used in Hong Kong would seem to be a matter of choice by the purchaser. It alsoseems to follow (although this was not touched upon in the evidence) that if the sale and purchase agreement was signed in the Mainland,no attestation fee would be payable to Lai &amp; Li. The pre-sale and purchase agreements signed by the purchasers were sent to theVendor who signed them (presumably in Shanghai). They were then registered and returned by the Vendor to Lai &amp; Li. Accordingto C.S. Lai, Lai &amp; Li would keep them until the signing of the formal sale and purchase agreement. There was no evidence howthe pre-sale and purchase agreements were returned to the purchasers if the sale and purchase agreements were signed in the Mainlandinstead of in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Unit 908 was the only unit where no pre-sale and purchase agreement was signed. C.S. Lai said he was told that Baldwin Wong was agood friend of one of the owners of the Vendor. Whether what he was told was true or not does not matter. I believe C.S. Lai musthave been given some reason by the Vendor, otherwise he would have followed up on the matter, not least because of the debit notesent by Lai &amp; Li to Baldwin Wong dated 25 June 1994 under which fees would have been payable to Lai &amp; Li. C.S. Lai also suggestedthat the reason why Baldwin Wong did not sign the pre-sale and purchase agreement was because he wished to re-sell the unit withoutincurring the transaction tax of 5%. My attention was drawn to Clause 7 of the Memorandum of Sale under which the purchaser might,with the consent of the Vendor, transfer his unit on payment of a handling fee of 0.1%.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Although Baldwin Wong did not sign any pre-sale and purchase agreement, further instalments, each of 10% of the purchase price, whichwere required to be paid under the Memorandum of Sale, were paid at six monthly intervals from 1 August 1994 to the Vendor via Lai&amp; Li.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Baldwin Wong's explanation that no pre-sale and purchase agreement was signed because he was not asked to sign is unconvincing. Imake no finding why the pre-sale and purchase agreement was not signed, but I do not believe it was because Baldwin Wong did notreceive any notice to sign the pre-sale and purchase agreement. It is quite clear from documents produced by the plaintiff, includingLai &amp; Li's bill dated 25 June 1994, that Baldwin Wong must have been received some notification. Moreover, as I have said, Clause2 of the Memorandum of Sale required the signing of a pre-sale and purchase agreement on a date to be appointed. I do not believeit is at all likely that the Hong Kong Agent or Lai &amp; Li would have informed the purchasers of the other units but omitted toinform Baldwin Wong. In this context, I note that in relation to Unit 1208, also handled by Lai &amp; Li and where the Memorandumof Sale was dated 14 March 1994, the pre-sale and purchase agreement was signed on 14 July 1994. The relevance of Unit 1208 willappear later (see para. 35 below).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Property was completed in 1996. By a Chinese letter dated 25 April 1996, the Hong Kong Agent informed Baldwin Wong of the completionof the Property and that he should attend Lai &amp; Li to deal with the completion of the transaction. The letter went on to saythat if Baldwin Wong wished to make inquiry about legal matters, he should contact C.S. Lai of Lai &amp; Li. This letter did notsay that Lai &amp; Li were acting as CAAO only nor that they were the Vendor's solicitors only. C.S. Lai said he had no prior knowledgeof the content of the letter. But I cannot infer from that that K.M. Lai or Lai &amp; Li did not know. In all probability I believeLai &amp; Li were aware of the content of this letter. I do not believe the Vendor would have written in these terms, if the Vendorhad not been assured that Lai &amp; Li would entertain enquiries about legal matters from the purchasers.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> That letter was sent together with a letter from Lai &amp; Li also dated 25 April 1996. It is also in Chinese. By this letter thepurchaser was notified to pay the balance of the purchase price as well as other expenses between 29 April 1996 and 13 May 1996,and to sign the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Deed of Mutual Covenant and mortgages if applicable. Also, if the purchaser is a corporation,it should bring along :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the company seal;</p>        <p>(2) its business registration and certificate of incorporation;</p>        <p>(3) register of directors;</p>        <p>(4) board resolution (three copies); and</p>        <p>(5) the authorised signatory's ID card/passport.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It concluded by saying that if the purchaser had any question or that further assistance was required, the purchaser should contactLai &amp; Li at any time. The letter did not say that Lai &amp; Li were acting as CAAO only nor that they were the Vendor's solicitorsonly. It also did not say that such further assistance would be given without any responsibility and as the Vendor's solicitors only,and hence on behalf of a person with a conflicting interest. Nor did it say that the purchaser was under no direct obligation topay any fees to Lai &amp; Li and that any fees payable would be payable by the purchaser pursuant to its contract with the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Between the notice of 25 April 1996 and 13 May 1996 when the Sale and Purchase Agreement was signed, Baldwin Wong, with the consentof the Vendor, transferred Unit 908 to the plaintiff. That was done by cancelling the Memorandum of Sale and the signing of a newmemorandum of sale by the plaintiff dated 1 May 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The plaintiff was a property holding company in Hong Kong. It had a small staff, but substantial property holdings. I have the distinctimpression that the purchase of the unit was of no great significance to the plaintiff. At the trial, a Miss Tammy Chan Shui Kwan("Miss Chan"), who left the plaintiff's employment in December 1996 but signed the Sale and Purchase Agreement on 13 May 1996, cameback from the U.K. to give evidence. A Miss Li Mei Hing ("Miss Li"), whose responsibility was on the accounts side but who accompaniedMiss Chan to Lai &amp; Li on 13 May 1996, also gave evidence. A Miss Au Pui Sze ("Miss Au"), whose evidence related to a later period,also gave evidence. In addition, Mrs Patsy Wong Ng Kai Fung ("Mrs Wong"), the wife of Baldwin Wong, also gave evidence. So did BaldwinWong.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> It is common ground that prior to 13 May 1996, Miss Chan spoke to C.S. Lai and sought help from him regarding the documents requiredfor the completion, e.g. the wording of the board resolution which was required. It is relevant only to note para. 3 of the boardresolution which appointed Tsui and the Vendor as the plaintiff's representative to arrange for the obtaining of the title deed andregistration, etc. It was not C.S. Lai's evidence that he had made clear to Miss Chan that in rendering such assistance, Lai &amp;Li were acting as the Vendor's solicitors only. Lai &amp; Li, of course, are solicitors and notaries in Hong Kong. The firm as suchis not a CAAO. A CAAO is appointed in his individual capacity only.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> On or about 9 May 1996, by fax, Lai &amp; Li sent to the plaintiff their bill no. 44278. The bill is pre-printed. Against the word"client", the name of the plaintiff appeared. According to Mr T.C. Foo, a CAAO, who is also a solicitor, would normally issue a feenote for the attestation fees in the name of the firm of solicitors, in which he was a member. That is done so that the transactionwould be covered by the insurance of the firm as solicitors. Thus, it was in Lai &amp; Li's interest to act as Hong Kong solicitors.Bill no. 44278 conveyed the message that Lai &amp; Li were acting as a Hong Kong solicitor. Lai &amp; Li's case is that they actedas a Hong Kong solicitor for the Vendor. They never acted for the plaintiff. Insofar as Ma witnessed the plaintiff's signatures Madid so as CAAO for the Vendor. That the name of the plaintiff appeared on bill no. 44278 for convenience sake only. The client wasin fact the Vendor, although the plaintiff was contractually liable to the Vendor to pay on its behalf. Anyway, that is the effectof C.S. Lai's evidence. But I do not see why on such an important issue, the court should be required to rely on the evidence ofa conveyancing clerk only. Ma's evidence did not touch on this. K.M. Lai was not called. Nor the 2nd defendant. I am not preparedto proceed on the basis that C.S. Lai was privy to all the discussions or agreements with the Vendor on the Vendor's liability topay any fees. There is no evidence on which I am prepared to find that the Vendor was liable to pay any of the fees. Insofar as C.S.Lai's evidence suggested that, I am not prepared to accept it. As I have said the Letter of Appointment is silent on fees.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Bill no. 44278 is divided into two parts. Under lawyers' fees, there were a total of six items in the printed form. However, onlyfour of them are relevant in relation to this purchase :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="45%">Sale and Purchase Agreement</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$17,900</td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="45%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="45%">Certificate of legal representative for corporation</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$2,000</td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="45%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(4)</td>                <td valign="top" width="45%">Letter of Authorisation</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$2,600</td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="45%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(6)</td>                <td valign="top" width="45%" class="quote">"Deed of Mutual Covenant"</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="20%">$1,000</td>                <td valign="top" width="20%"></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>The other two items only applied to mortgages. The plaintiff did not require any mortgage. The four items totalling $23,500 can bedescribed as profits costs for Lai &amp; Li. There is no attempt to explore by way of evidence on whose behalf (3) and (6) were incurred.As for (1) and (4), if they were incurred by the plaintiff and not the Vendor, that would be highly relevant to the question whetherthere was any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and Lai &amp; Li. In the Defence, para. 10(iv), the defendants assertedthat "the legal cost paid to the Firm (as the Vendor's solicitors) in connection with the sale and purchase of the Property was HK$23,500".Insofar as fees were charged by Lai &amp; Li for attesting the Sale and Purchase Agreement, it is Lai &amp; Lai's case that suchcosts were payable to them as the Vendor's solicitors. There is no evidence that had the plaintiff not used the services of Lai &amp;Li, the Vendor would have been liable to pay any or all of the $17,900. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the attestationfee would have been payable to Lai &amp; Li, if, for instance, the plaintiff were to employ another CAAO to attest its signaturein Hong Kong. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the plaintiff was not free to employ another CAAO to attest its signaturein Hong Kong. Indeed, the plaintiff could have signed the Sale and Purchase Agreement in the Mainland, and not to use any CAAO atall. It is Lai &amp; Li's case that the fee was a "scale fee" which a CAAO was required to charge by the Association of China-AppointedAttesting Officers Ltd ("the Association") which regulated the conduct of CAAOs in Hong Kong. However, C.S. Lai also claimed thatit was an all-in fee and covered the drafting of the Sales and Purchase Agreement. So it is not Lai &amp; Li's case that the wholeof the $17,900 was incurred by the Vendor for the drafting of the Sale and Purchase Agreement which was in a printed form and hadto be purchased from the relevant authority in Shanghai. The assistance given by Lai &amp; Li consisted in filling in the blanks.It was unlikely that they were contractually entitled to charge the Vendor say $17,900 multiplied by the number of units they handled.Even if part of the fees was for drafting and part for attestation, the Vendor was not liable to pay to Lai &amp; Li for attestation.Anyway there was no evidence to such effect. On this important issue, there was really no satisfactory evidence. I think it is moreprobable that the Vendor did not have to pay any fee because Lai &amp; Li were quite happy to provide their services in return forthe fees which they might earn from acting for the purchasers. If Lai &amp; Li charged the plaintiff fees for services rendered tothe plaintiff then there would be at least an implied retainer. I note that in para. 11 of the Amended Defence, the "Defendants furtheraver that the Plaintiff was aware that the 3rd Defendant (Ma) was an attesting witness to the documents and the Firm was only responsiblefor arranging notarization of the same for use in Shanghai thereafter." It is perhaps of greater relevance to note the particularssupplied under para. 11, namely, it was not Lai &amp; Li's case that the plaintiff was expressly informed. The matters relied onto support the alleged awareness were at best equivocal. Some of the more important ones are dealt with later in this judgment. Ido not believe the plaintiff was so aware at all. On the contrary, I believe the plaintiff was led to believe by the two lettersreferred to in paras. 18 and 19 above and by bill no. 44278 that Lai &amp; Li were acting as solicitors in the transaction for theplaintiff as well as for the Vendor. There is no evidence that the plaintiff was told that the sum of $17,900 was a scale fee, orwhy the plaintiff had to pay.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Lai &amp; Li charged $2,600 as lawyer's fees in relation to the Letter of Authorisation. The Letter of Authorisation authorizes/appointsTsui and the Vendor, or either of them, to represent the purchaser to obtain the title deed as well as to effect registration. Alsodisbursement in the sum of $11,793 for Shanghai lawyer's fees were collected by Lai &amp; Li from the plaintiff. In drafting andattesting the Letter of Authorisation were Lai &amp; Li acting for the plaintiff or for the Vendor?</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Ng has argued the fact that lawyer's fees were charged shows that there was an implied or express retainer by the plaintiff ofLai &amp; Li. That may depend on whether the plaintiff was obliged to pay those fees pursuant to their contract with the Vendor.If they were contractually bound to pay those fees to Lai &amp; Li because of their contract with the Vendor, then it does not necessarilyfollow that by paying those fees they had retained Lai &amp; Li to act for them or that Lai &amp; Li had agreed to act for them.Mr Liu which appeared for the defendant referred me to Clause 14 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement which provides : "that if thepurchaser were to appoint the Vendor or any third-party to handle the notarization transfer registration and the obtaining of titledeed then the Vendor must at the time when this Sale and Purchase Agreement was signed also signed the relevant Letters of Appointment."No doubt, it was contemplated that in most if not all cases the Vendor and the lawyer nominated by the Vendor would be appointedby the purchaser for the purpose. But that would be as a matter of convenience for the purchaser as opposed to a contractual obligation.There is no evidence how or why the plaintiff decided or agreed to appoint the Vendor and/or Tsui for that purpose. But it has notbeen made clear why the Vendor would become liable to pay Lai &amp; Li for the Letter of Authorisation if the plaintiff chose tosign a Letter of Authorisation. It seems that if the plaintiff had decided not to appoint anyone at all, no fee would have been payablefor the Letter of Authorisation.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> On the evidence, I am unable to conclude that the fees charged for the Letter of Authorisation or for the Sale and Purchase Agreementwere incurred by the Vendor such that the plaintiff was contractually bound to the Vendor to pay on the Vendor's behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Now if those fees, or part of them, were incurred by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was contractually liable to pay Lai &amp; Li,then there would be a contract between them.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The other part of the bill covered expenses, the first item of which is Shanghai lawyer's fees of $11,793. Presumably, this was Tsui'sfees. Again, this was not explored in evidence, but it seems that Tsui's fees were incurred by the plaintiff to Tsui, thus, thereshould be a direct relationship with Tsui.</p>    <p class="heading">13 May 1996</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> It is common ground that on 13 May 1996 the Sale and Purchase Agreement was signed. The events of 13 May 1996 are important becauseof the conflicting evidence about what was said on this occasion.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The witnesses were required to recall events which happened almost eight years ago. One would expect some discrepancies. Many ofthe discrepancies are unimportant. For example, whether Miss Chan and Miss Li were asked to read the documents in the reception areaor in the conference room where the documents were eventually signed.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The important conflicting evidence came after the documents were signed. After the documents were signed and the balance of the paymentmade, Miss Chan said she was given two receipts by C.S. Lai, the first for $2,184,046 being balance of the purchase price, and theother for $332,766 being costs and disbursement. She was also given a receipt signed on behalf of the Hong Kong Agent evidencingpayment of management fees and deposits and, lastly, a document dated 13 May 1996 signed by Lai &amp; Li and addressed to the Vendorcertifying that the balance of the purchase price had been paid. This last document would enable the plaintiff to obtain possessionof Unit 908 in Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> According to Miss Chan, she asked for photocopies of all the documents that she had signed, but that was turned down by C.S. Laibecause C.S. Lai said that those documents needed to be signed by the Vendor and there was no point in giving her copies. She alsosaid that in the presence of C.S. Lai and Ma, she asked about the title deed registration. She said C.S. Lai confirmed that the Lai&amp; Li would follow up on the matter and let the plaintiff had the title deed in due course. That there was nothing else for theplaintiff to do except to take possession of the unit and wait for the title deed from Lai &amp; Li. She also claimed that C.S. Laitold her that there was no need for the plaintiff to engage its own lawyers, when Miss Chan told C.S. Lai that the plaintiff wouldengage its own lawyers unless Lai &amp; Li were acting for the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> According to C.S. Lai, he did not remember Miss Chan asking for copies of the documents that she had signed but that if he had beenasked for those documents he would have made copies for her. I prefer C.S. Lai's evidence. I do not believe that if Miss Chan hadasked for copies, she would have been satisfied with the excuse that they had not been signed by the Vendor yet. Miss Chan did notgive me the impression that she could have been so easily fobbed off. According to C.S. Lai, Miss Chan did ask about the procedureor what was to happen thereafter. He also said he would have told her even if she had not asked. He told her that Lai &amp; Li wouldsend all the documents to the China Legal Services Office in Hong Kong for certification and then all the documents would be sentto the Vendor for them to sign and to have notarised. Then the Vendor would pay the taxes and effect registration. Since the plaintiffhad appointed the Vendor and Tsui, that was what they would do for the plaintiff and the title deed would be given to the plaintiffby the Vendor and not by Lai &amp; Li, so that later they would have to chase the Vendor for the title deed. He said that was somethingthat he would tell every buyer unless there was a mortgage in which event the purchaser would be told that the title deed would begiven to the mortgagee bank.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I have said that according to C.S. Lai, he would tell every purchaser that the title deed would be delivered to the purchaser bythe Vendor except where the property was under mortgage. There is support for his evidence from a Mr Lai Kam Wah, who is a solicitorbut not a relative of any of the defendants or C.S. Lai. He was one of the directors of a company called Co-Land Property Limited,the purchaser of Unit 1208. As mentioned above (para. 17), a memorandum of sale was entered on 14 March 1994 in relation to Unit1208. A pre-sale and purchase agreement was signed on 14 July 1994. In this case there was a mortgage and the mortgage was in favourof The Kwangtung Provincial Bank Shenzhan Branch. On 17 October 1996, he and his fellow directors attended the offices of Lai &amp;Li to sign various documents including the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Mortgage Contract and the Deed of Guarantee. Accordingto him, after the documents were signed, he was told by C.S. Lai that all the documents would be sent to the Vendor by Lai &amp;Li for the Vendor signature, notarization and registration in the Mainland and that thereafter the Vendor would deliver to the purchaserdirect the relevant title deed, if the unit was not mortgaged to any bank, but as the unit was mortgaged, these documents would bedelivered to the bank, and that the relevant title deed would be released by the bank to Co-Land upon full payment of the mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Lai Kam Wah is a practicing solicitor and admits that he knows the defendants as fellow practitioners. I think he is a reliablewitness. I believe he was indeed told by C.S. Lai that title deed would be returned to the purchaser by the Vendor if there was nomortgage.</p>    <p class="heading">Events after 13 May 1996</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> According to Baldwin Wong, shortly after 13 May, he noticed from a document although it was not the bill no. 44278 that the plaintiffwas described as the client. In his witness statement, he said the document was the bill no. 44278. He said he asked Miss Chan whetherLai &amp; Li represented the plaintiff. According to him, Miss Chan said "should be". That was not good enough for Baldwin Wong.He told Miss Chan that it was better to make clear whether Lai &amp; Li represented the plaintiff, if not, the plaintiff would instructMessrs Ng &amp; Yung, their regular solicitors, so that the plaintiff would not be unrepresented. He said at that time Mrs Wong wasin the office and she heard the conversation. He said Miss Chan seemed reluctant to call. Sensing reluctance on Miss Chan's part,Mrs Wong decided to call Lai &amp; Li and ask whether they represented the plaintiff. He said Mrs Wong subsequently told him thatthat was confirmed by Lai &amp; Li. He said Mrs Wong asked the person who was responsible for the project at Lai &amp; Li, whetherLai &amp; Li were helping the plaintiff to do everything which was required to be done including getting the title deed as lawyersand that, if not, the plaintiff would get another lawyer. According to her, she was told "Yes, Lai &amp; Li would do everything foryou". He said that was why that he did not instruct Ng &amp; Yung to help.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I have to say I find his evidence unconvincing. If the plaintiff would have instructed another firm of solicitors to represent theirinterests if Lai &amp; Li were not acting for them, I would have thought the plaintiff would want to find out before the documentswere signed on 13 May, whether Lai &amp; Li were also acting for them, and not afterwards.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> But there is more. The evidence from the plaintiff is that thereafter at least twice yearly, arising out of the preparation of accountsand the audit of the plaintiff's account, someone from the plaintiff would call Lai &amp; Li and asked to speak to the person responsiblefor the project to inquire about the title deed. That would be about March and July of each year. Miss Chan called before she leftin December. Thereafter, Miss Li, Miss Au and a Mr Tsui did. Miss Li and Miss Au duly gave evidence confirming that. The last time,according to Baldwin Wong, that Lai &amp; Li were called was in July of 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Each time, it is said, that the person answering the call on behalf of Lai &amp; Li would say that the title deed were not yet availableand that they should wait. C.S. Lai's evidence, which I accept, is that if anyone had called and asked to speak to the person incharge of the project, the call would have been put through to him. He said that was only one call from the plaintiff and that wasunrelated to title deed. The call was made to obtain a contact number.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I find it difficult to believe that if the calls had been made. C.S. Lai would have said what he was supposed to have said. Surely,as is clear from the documents produced in relation to Unit 1208, the Certificate of Title (å°ç¢æ¬è¨¼) was issued as early as18 December 1996. Nor was Unit 1208 an isolated event. According to C.S. Lai, there were other units which were under mortgage. IfC.S. Lai had been asked after December 1996, I believe he would have told the plaintiff that Lai &amp; Li had not been given thetitle deed and that the plaintiff should ask the Vendor for the title deed. Since the title deed were already available in relationto the mortgaged units, I do not believe C.S. Lai would have said repeatedly that title deed would take a long time and was not yetavailable. I am also of the view that if the question of title deed and registration were mentioned on 13 May 1996 by Miss Chan,there is no reason why C.S. Lai should not have told Miss Chan that the title deed would be returned to the plaintiff by the Vendor.It is C.S. Lai's evidence which I accept that of the units handled by Lai &amp; Li, apart from those where there were mortgages,no title document was ever delivered by the Vendor to Lai &amp; Li.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The evidence of Miss Chan is that in August 1996, she and Miss Li went to Shanghai to take possession of the property, but all attemptsto let the property was unsuccessful.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> According to Mrs Wong, it was in 2001, after she had enlisted the help of a Mr Shing to let the unit that she was told by Mr Shingthat in order to do so she would need to have the title deeds. She explained she was told the tenant might wish to be satisfied thatthe plaintiff was indeed the owner of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Although the plaintiff had instructed well-known companies such as First Pacific Davies to let the unit previously, apparently noneof the other property agents ever told the plaintiff that the title deeds were necessary for the purpose of letting.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I have to say that I find the evidence of Mrs Wong unreliable. I do not believe that she had called Lai &amp; Li shortly after 13May 1996. I am not willing to rely on her evidence relating to her dealings with Mr Shing.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I turn to consider the evidence of Ma, who attested the documents on 31 May. According to him, he left the conference room afterthe documents were witnessed and before the receipts were given to Miss Chan. Thus, he was not there when the important conversationtook place between Miss Chan and C.S. Lai. He was criticized by Mr Peter Ng, SC, counsel for the plaintiff, and I think rightly so,for the fact that in his witness statement in para. 5, he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...I adopt and repeat herein those matters stated by C.S. Lai at paragraphs 2 to 36 of his Witness Statement and I confirm the sameto be true and correct." (See B-134)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In cross-examination, it transpired that the only paragraph in C.S. Lai's statement that he had personal knowledge of was para. 24.And that in relation to the all important para. 26, namely :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Before Miss Chan left the Firm's office on 13th May 1996, I told her that since the Vendor had undertaken to handle notarisationof contract and registration matters, the Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement and all relevant documents would be forwarded by the Firmto Shanghai for the Vendor's signature and handling, and as the Unit was not mortgaged to any bank, the Vendor would deliver therelevant title documents and certificate(s) to the Plaintiff direct instead of through the Firm.",</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Ma has no personal knowledge. Be that as it may, Ma's evidence is relevant in two respects, namely, that he contradicted Miss Chan'sallegation that it was in his presence that C.S. Lai confirmed that Lai &amp; Li would be dealing the title deed and returning themto the plaintiff in due course. Secondly, according to him, he said to Miss Chan, that he was attesting her signature as a "å¬è¨¼äºº".This is relied on in the Particulars to show that the plaintiff was aware that "the firm was only responsible for arranging notarizationof the (documents) for use in Shanghai thereafter". But this statement was at best equivocal. It did not say that Lai &amp; Li actedin no other capacity. It is obvious that Lai &amp; Li did not merely act as CAAOs in the sale of the Property, they acted as theVendor's solicitors. Indeed, they also acted for the mortgagee bank where mortgages were required. Just as importantly, the plaintiffwas never told that Lai &amp; Li acted as CAAO and as nothing else so far as the plaintiff was concerned. Thus, the fact that Maacted as "å¬è¨¼äºº", even if that is taken to be a reference to CAAO and is factually correct, does not take Lai &amp; Li's casevery far. However, insofar as Ma contradicted Miss Chan's evidence I prefer Ma's evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> C.S. Lai was cross-examined on the letter dated 4 June 1994 from the Hong Kong Agent to Lai &amp; Li dated 4 June 1996, where itsaid "after notarisation and completion of title deed they would be returned to Lai &amp; Li to facilitate completion of procedurerelating to the Sale and Purchase contract (å¾å¬è¨¼åå°æ¿è¨¼æçºå®æå¾ï¼äº¤åè²´å¸ï¼ä»¥ä¾¿å®æåºå®ååæçº)."This contradicted the evidence of C.S. Lai in a very important respect. This letter which acknowledged receipt of Sale and PurchaseAgreement in relation to 43 units including Unit 908 stated that the title deeds would be returned to Lai &amp; Li. C.S. Lai saidthat after the receipt of this letter, he told Mr Roman Chung of the Hong Kong Agent who signed this letter that the last sentencewas incorrect and Mr Chung agreed. In answer to me, he said insofar as the title document relating to units under mortgage wouldbe sent back to Lai &amp; Li, who would then forward them to the mortgagee bank, this sentence is correct. But it was not correctin relation to the units not under mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I have considered this very carefully and have to say that this letter made me pause in accepting C.S. Lai as a reliable witness.Nor am I persuaded that there was indeed this conversation with Mr Roman Chung. I had the distinct impression that C.S. Lai was uncomfortablegiving such evidence. However, after careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that on the critical question about whatwas said on 13 May 1996 and on whether there was the alleged conversations regarding the title deed between 13 May 1996 and July2001, the evidence of the plaintiff is unconvincing and unreliable. Of course, that does not mean I must accept the evidence of C.S.Lai in full or even in part. But there is other support for C.S. Lai's evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In this context, I should mention letters which were written by the plaintiff to Lai &amp; Li in 2001. The first letter is dated7 August 2001, it was drafted and signed by Baldwin Wong, and it reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are the registered owner of the above property, which was brought through your firm, and have just noticed that so far we havenot received the title deeds of the above property.</p>        <p class="quote">Enclosed please find your debit note no.44278 for your easy reference.</p>        <p class="quote">Please let us have the title deeds as soon as possible."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The reply from Lai &amp; Li is dated 15 August 2001 says :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" We have passed your letter dated 7th August 2001 to the Developer for their attention.</p>        <p class="quote">In the meantime, please contact the Developer whose address and telephone numbers are ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>C.S. Lai was questioned on this reply, for example, why there was no response to the statement that ".... the above property, whichwas brought through your firm ...." if Ma or Lai &amp; Li only acted as CAAO. C.S. Lai was unable to explain, although he draftedthe letter.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> On the same day, presumably after the receipt of this letter, the plaintiff wrote to the Hong Kong Agent :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are the registered owner of the above property, for which you acted as the sale agent for the Vendor, and have just noticed thatso far we have not received the title deeds of the above property.</p>        <p class="quote">Enclosed please find a copy of the Memorandum of Sales No. 0149.</p>        <p class="quote">Please let us have the title deeds or advise how it can be obtained at your earliest convenience."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The next letter from the plaintiff to Lai &amp; Li is dated 16 August 2001 and, after saying that they had contacted the Vendor inHong Kong but were told that no one in Hong Kong could handle the matter, the letter went on to say :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As we bought the property through your firm we assume you would let us have the Title Deed. If this is not the case please let usknow the reason and how we can obtain the document."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> When Baldwin Wong was questioned about the wording of the letter dated 16 August 2001, he said the wording is not correct. That isbecause it had been toned down. He said the original also drafted by him was very strong. He showed it to Miss Li and his wife andthey wanted him to tone it down, because they wanted to obtain information from Lai &amp; Li and wanted Lai &amp; Li's co-operation.He said in the original draft he had written words to the effect that : "as your have promised to act as our lawyer, why should wehave to contact the Developer". And in relation to the letter dated 7 August 2001, he said it was not quite appropriate either becausethey had been chasing Lai &amp; Li for the title deed, indeed, the last time, as recently as the end of July 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Baldwin Wong is a highly qualified person. He is a Chartered Accountant of great seniority. He had lectured at the Hong Kong Universityon Accountancy for a number of years. At one time, he was the Chief Accountant of K.M.B. He struck me as a highly intelligent andarticulate person. I do not believe that if the plaintiff had been chasing Lai &amp; Li for the title deed on a semi-annual basissince 1997 and it seems on several occasions in 1996, the plaintiff would have written the letters dated 7 August and 16 August inthis way. Indeed, if the evidence of Miss Chan, Miss Li and Mrs Wong about the events of 13 May 1996 and shortly thereafter weretrue these letters would have been worded very differently. Moreover, if as recently as July 2001, C.S. Lai had said in responseto enquiry from Miss Au that the title deed was not yet ready and the plaintiff should wait, I do not believe Lai &amp; Li wouldhave replied as they did in their letter of 15 August 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> On 27 August 2001, the plaintiff wrote again asking Lai &amp; Li for various original documents : "to enable us to obtain the titledeed (æ¿å°ç¢æ¬è¨¼) of the property". I do not wish to refer to other correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendantssuffice it for me to say that in none of the letters written by the plaintiff to Lai &amp; Li, was it ever suggested that Lai &amp;Li had ever agreed or said that the title deeds would be delivered by Lai &amp; Li to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Moreover, prior to the plaintiff writing to Lai &amp; Li in August, the plaintiff had written to the management company in Shanghai.The letter is letter dated 22 June 2001, where it was written :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"æå¸çºä¸è¿°å®ä½ä¹æ¥­ä¸»ï¼ä¸¦å·²æ¼ä¸ä¹ä¹å­å¹´å«æè¦ªå°ä¸æµ·æ¥æ¶éåï¼åå§è¨åä»»ç®¡çå¬å¸ä»£çºè¾¦çæ¿å°ç¢è¨¼æçºã</p>        <p class="quote">å¯ç¾ä»ç¿»æ¥æªæ¡ï¼ç¼è¦ºä¸è¿°å®ä½ä¹æ¿å°ç¢è¨¼å°æªå°æãç¾ç©è«è²´ å¸ä»£æ¥è©²æ¿å°ç¢è¨¼ä¹ä¸è½ãè¥ç¶æªè¾¦ææä»éº¼æçºéè¦å®æï¼ç©è«åç¥ãè¬è¬ã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was followed by a chaser on 23 July 2001. Miss Li who drafted and signed the letter dated 22 June was cross-examined about thisletter. She was asked why it was written that the plaintiff had appointed the former management company to handle the proceduresrelating to the title deeds. She said that is not true, there was never any such authorization but that it was written in this wayin the letter in order to find out whether in fact the title deeds were with the management company. I have to say I find her answerunsatisfactory. I believe the fact that the plaintiff should have written to the management company, which is obviously part of theLucky Target Group, prior to their writing to Lai &amp; Li in August 2001 supports the view that the plaintiff believed that thetitle deed was supposed to be delivered to them by the Vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> After carefully considering all the evidence and the submissions made, I am persuaded that C.S. Lai had told Miss Chan that the titledeed would come from the Vendor notwithstanding my concern over the letter of 4 June 1996 referred to in para. 48 above. However,I am not prepared to go further and find that C.S. Lai actually said to Miss Chan that she should chase the Vendor for the titledeeds. This was not in his witness statement. The significance of the evidence was obvious and I would have expected it to be includedin his witness statement, if it was really part of the conversation on 13 May 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> I turn to consider whether, notwithstanding that I have rejected the evidence of the plaintiff and accepted the evidence of the defendantregarding what was said on 13 May 1996 and therefore can proceed on the basis that the plaintiff was told and understood that theywould obtain the title deed from the Vendor, Lai &amp; Li might nevertheless be liable to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Mr Ng made the point that what Lai &amp; Li told the plaintiff was that they "would" get their title deed from the Vendor not thatthey might or might not get the title deed from the Vendor and by saying so they had assumed the responsibility of advising the plaintiffwhich the plaintiff had relied on to their detriment. He said it does not matter that the plaintiff might have been untruthful intheir evidence, the important thing is that the plaintiff relying on the defendants did nothing or there is no evidence that theydid anything in relation to the title deed until they wrote the letters in June 2001 to the management company in Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Mr Ng also complained that Lai &amp; Li failed to inform the plaintiff that Lai &amp; Li were acting as CAAO only in the transactionand they were not acting as solicitors for the purchaser, namely the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> There is force in these submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> According to the evidence of Mr T.C. Foo, it was the common and good practice in 1996 for CAAO so to inform purchasers in the positionof the plaintiff because of the confusion which might otherwise arise. The Association, by their Notice No. 259 of 9 December 1999,expressly stated that a CAAO should inform a purchaser what services the CAAO would provide and that the CAAO did not act as a legaladviser or lawyer, would not assess the risk nor interpret any Chinese law or give any legal opinion, and that apart from the servicesrendered no other services would be provided by the CAAO. According to Mr T.C. Foo, that was good and common practice in 1996 aswell and applied to completed property as well as property sold in the course of construction. This common and good practice wasnot followed.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> I have already found that there was a contract between the plaintiff and Lai &amp; Li arising out of the payment of fees to Lai &amp;Li for work performed by Lai &amp; Li for the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">UNDER SUCH CONTRACT, WHAT DUTIES DID LAI &amp; LI OWE TO THE PLAINTIFF?</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> I believe such duties included at least the duty to advise the plaintiff on the terms of the Letter of Authorisation as well as therisk involved in authorising the Vendor as well as Tsui to obtain the title deed or effect the registration. It is common sense thatthere was a potential conflict regarding the Vendor. It may be that in the case of purchasers whose pre-sale and purchase agreementshad been registered, it did not matter because they were protected by such registration already, but as Lai &amp; Li knew, the plaintiffhad not entered into a pre-sale and purchase agreement. Why could not the Sale and Purchase Agreement after registration be returnedto Lai &amp; Li (as in the case of mortgages) as an added protection to the plaintiff, such that in case of delay Lai &amp; Li couldfollow up? Mr Liu made the point that Lai &amp; Li did not have the competence to advise the plaintiff because the Letter of Authorisationwas meant to be used in the Mainland. If that is so I think Lai &amp; Li should have made that clear to the plaintiff so that theplaintiff could seek advice elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> I also believe it is common sense that the Letter of Authorisation together with the requisite lawyer's fee should be sent directlyto Tsui. These documents did not need the signature of the Vendor. It is not clear whether Lai &amp; Li or the Vendor were authorisedby Tsui to collect the lawyer's fee from the plaintiff. If not, then in the event of the bankruptcy of the Vendor then <em>vis-Ã -vis</em> Tsui payment by the plaintiff to the Vendor was not payment to Tsui. These are elementary matters which anybody acting on behalfof the plaintiff should have warned the plaintiff. On the other hand, if it is thought that this also involved the Mainland law orprocedure and Lai &amp; Li did not have the competence to advise, Lai &amp; Li should also have informed the plaintiff accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Mr T.C. Foo has given evidence on the role and function of CAAO. I have no reason not to accept his evidence. Indeed, I find hisevidence on the role and function of CAAO persuasive. But the fact that a CAAO has a limited role to play as a CAAO does not meanthat in a particular transaction his duty was confined to that of a CAAO. Here, it is accepted that Lai &amp; Li acted as the HongKong solicitors for the Vendor. Lai &amp; Li also acted for the mortgagee where mortgages were required. The critical question inthis case is whether Lai &amp; Li's role <em>vis-Ã -vis</em> the plaintiff was confined to that of a CAAO, and if so, what would that entail?</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> It is of interest to note that according to Directive No. 259, so far as properties under construction were concerned, a CAAO isrequired to inform the purchaser what services he would provide. Such services include the delivery of the pre-sale agreement tothe notarial office for notarization and relevant department for registration. Also it included the retrieval of the pre-sale agreementand the delivery of such pre-sale agreement to the buyer or its nominee. Whether the same services were meant to be provided by aCAAO in Hong Kong in relation to completed property was not explored at the hearing. So I mention this in passing only. But I alsomake the point that it is common sense that the pre-sale agreement should be sent by the CAAO to the relevant government departmentin the Mainland for notarization as well as for registration, and then for the CAAO to retrieve such documents and then to give themto the buyer or its nominee. That provides obvious and necessary protection to the purchaser. Indeed taxes payable should be sentdirectly to the relevant government department. Nor is it an answer to say that signature by the Vendor would be required. I cansee no reason why the Vendor could not have signed first or in Hong Kong if that is the only way to protect the purchaser. In thecase of a sale and purchase agreement which has been preceded by a pre-sale and purchase agreement, it may be that such protectionis not required because of the earlier registration. I make no finding. There is no evidence one way or the other. But in this case,or in the sale of a completed unit, where there would be no pre-sale and purchase agreement, I believe the same procedure shouldbe adopted, and that the purchaser should be advised accordingly. If for any reason, a different procedure had to be adopted, thepurchaser should be advised of the implication, as well as the alternatives open to him, e.g. signing the sale and purchase agreementin the Mainland which would require attestation by a Chinese notary and which would ensure registration. Of course, in so advisingthe CAAO would probably deprive himself of the opportunity of earning the attestation fees from the purchaser. But I see no reasonwhy a purchaser should be totally unprotected without the most explicit warning.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> As I have said I can see no reason why in the case of the sale of a completed unit, why at least the Letter of Authorisation as wellas the fees payable to the Mainland lawyer should not be sent directly to the Mainland lawyer.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> If Lai &amp; Li were authorised by Tsui to collect fees payable to him for registration and the obtaining of title deed, I can seeno reason why such fees should not be sent to Tsui direct. It was argued that because under the Letter of Authorisation, the Vendorwas also appointed, that might explain why it was sent to the Vendor. But there was no explanation why Tsui's fee was neverthelesscharged and paid. Does that mean there would be a refund in case Tsui was not instructed? Should not the plaintiff be advised aboutthat too?</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Indeed, putting it at the very lowest, Lai &amp; Li owed a duty to inform Tsui of his appointment and payment of his fees to theVendor. In that event, if Tsui did not receive his fees or the Letter of Authorisation one would expect Tsui to inform Lai &amp;Li who would be under a duty to inform the plaintiff of the same.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> I do not believe what C.S. Lai told Miss Chan was a sufficient discharge of Lai &amp; Li's duty. What he said was equivocal. He didnot say that Lai &amp; Li did not act for the plaintiff as solicitors in Hong Kong. Nor that Lai &amp; Li acted as CAAO and nothingelse. Nor what that involved. To say the documents would be sent to the Vendor for signature and notarization was also equivocalor incomplete because the Letter of Authorisation need not be signed by the Vendor nor further notarised. Furthermore, it was neversaid that Tsui's fees would not be sent to Tsui direct. Nor that Lai &amp; Li would not follow up. I think it was to cover the lastpoint that the evidence that Miss Chan was told that the plaintiff would have to chase the Vendor for the title deeds was led. Ihave not accepted this part of C.S. Fai's evidence. In any event, even this is equivocal. It is not said that Lai &amp; Li woulddo nothing at all and that their job ended on 13 May. If that was the case, it should have been clearly stated.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Lastly, I find that the fact that everything was left to C.S. Lai, experienced conveyancing clerk though he might be, is unsatisfactory.Important information, especially warnings that the purchaser was completely unprotected (for according to Lai &amp; Li, the plaintiffwas totally unprotected) should not have been left to C.S. Lai. Nor conveyed in such a causal manner.</p>    <p class="heading">NEGLIGENCE</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> If, however, I should be wrong about any contractual duty of care owed by Lai &amp; Li to the plaintiff, I believe in all the circumstancesLai &amp; Li also owed a tortious duty of care to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> I refer to the letters referred to in paras. 18 and 19 above and the fact that before 13 May 1995 Lai &amp; Li did give assistanceto the plaintiff in connection with its board resolution and other documents. I also take into account the admitted fact that Lai&amp; Li never told the plaintiff that they were acting as solicitors for the Vendor only. I have also found that what Ma told MissChan when the documents were signed in his presence on 13 May 1995 was equivocal. Although I have rejected the plaintiff's evidence,I think in all the circumstances it is possible for me to find that they had relied on Lai &amp; Li to give them assistance regardingthe purchase. More importantly, Lai &amp; Li had assumed the responsibility to do so. Such assistance would include at least advisingthe plaintiff that they were unprotected. I also believe Lai &amp; Li assumed the responsibility to communicate to Tsui of the Letterof Authorisation as well as remit the lawyer's fees to him. If that had been done, I have no reason to believe that registrationwould not be effected or title deed obtained. Indeed, I believe Lai &amp; Li's duties to the plaintiff in tort is not less extensivethan their duties in contract.</p>    <p class="heading">CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> One defence relied on by Lai &amp; Li is contributory negligence although little time was spent on it. Insofar as the plaintiff'sclaim against Lai &amp; Li is based on contract and insofar as I have found that there was a contract between the plaintiff and Lai&amp; Li to exercise reasonable care, whether the defence of contributory negligence is available to Lai &amp; Li would depend onthe view I take of the law. In England, it has been held that the defence of contributory negligence is available where the defendant'sliability in contract is the same as his liability in the tort of negligence independently of the existence of the contract, see<strong>Vesta v. Butcher</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%20852" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 852 (CA).</a> However, in <strong>Michael Astley and Ors v. Austrust Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20Lloyds%20Rep%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] Lloyd's LR 758</a>, a case involving a solicitor and client, the High Court of Australia (by a majority) has held otherwise. I refer to the headnotes:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(4) ... contributory negligence is not a defence to an action in contract at common law and does not give rise to apportionment ofliability under the apportionment legislation even where, as here, the contractual duty is concurrent with a duty in the tort ofnegligence.</p>        <p class="quote">(5) ... there was no reason of justice or sound legal policy to prevent the respondent in a case such as the present from recoveringfor all the damages casually connected to the appellants' breach of contract even if the respondent's own conduct has contributedto the damage that he or she has suffered; by its own voluntary act, the appellant has accepted an obligation to take reasonablecare and, subject to remoteness rules, to pay damages for any loss or damage flowing from a breach of that obligation; if the appellantwishes to reduce its liability in a situation where respondent's own conduct contributes to the damage suffered, it is open to theappellants to make a bargain with the respondent to achieve that end; ...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The High Court of Australia was concerned with section 27A of the Wrongs Act 1936 of South Australia which is not materially differentfrom the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 or our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform Consolidation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> With respect, I found the majority decision in <strong>Astley v. Austrust</strong> so compelling that I feel bound to conclude that insofar as the plaintiff's claim succeeds on contract, the defence of contributorynegligence is not available as a matter of law. Gleeson CJ delivering the majority decision said at page 775 at the first column:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" At common law, contributory negligence, which was invented in 1808 is an answer to an action in nuisance, was a complete defenceto an action in tort for negligence. No case can be found in the books where contributory negligence, as such, was ever held to bea defence to an action for breach of contract. Moreover, if it had been a defence to breach of contract, it is impossible to understandwhy the great works on pleading written in the nineteenth century make no mention of it. No trace of the defence can be found inany of those works notwithstanding that, at least after the Hilary Term Rules of 1834, such a defence would have to have been speciallypleaded."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> At page 776 in the first column :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The fact that contributory negligence was not a defence to an action in contract points irresistibly to the conclusion that theapportionment legislation is concerned only with actions in tort and does not affect awards of damages based on breach of contract.To what, other than a common law action in tort, can section 27A(3) be referring when it says that a claim in respect of damage 'shallnot be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage'? It makes no sense now, and it made even less sense whenthe legislation was passed, to speak of an action in contract being <em>defeated</em> by 'negligence, breach of statutory duty or other act or omission which give rises to a liability in tort or would, apart from thisAct, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence.'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The purpose of the enactment of the apportionment legislation was to allow recovery of damages in cases where contributory negligencewould defeat an action in tort..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> I turn to consider whether if the tortious duty of care stood alone contributory negligence has been made out. Lai &amp; Li reliedon the fact that nothing was done by the plaintiff about the registration or the title deed until 2001. This is not an easy question.The matter is complicated by the fact that I do not accept the plaintiff's version of the facts. I am left with no evidence why theplaintiff did nothing between 1995 and 2001. I also take into consideration that I am of the view that C.S. Lai did tell Miss Chanthat the title deed would be handled by the Vendor and that they would be returned by the Vendor to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> In this context I must look at the evidence of C.S. Lai again. According to para. 26 of his statement, he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Before Miss Chan left the firm's office on 13 May 1996, I told her that since the Vendor had undertaken to handle notarisation ofcontract and registration matters, the Sale and Purchase Agreement and all relevant documents would be forwarded by the firm to Shanghaifor the Vendor's signature and handling, and as the unit was not mortgaged to any bank, the Vendor would deliver the relevant titledocuments and certificates to the plaintiff direct instead of through the firm."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> In his evidence, he added that the plaintiff would have to chase the Vendor for the title deed. I have said I am unwilling to acceptthis part of C.S. Lai's evidence. So on the facts I conclude that Miss Chan was merely told that the title deed would come from theVendor in due course but that she had not been told that she would have to chase the Vendor for them. Bearing in mind that legalprocedure in China might take time and that the title deed might not be available for a substantial length of time, the fact thatthe plaintiff had obtained possession of the property and had no reason to believe that anything was amiss, I am not satisfied thatthere was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">DAMAGES</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> The property has fallen in value. Mr Ng contends that Lai &amp; Li as the wrongdoer should not be allowed to take advantages of thedownward movement in the market. So he contends that damages should be assessed as at May 1996. I was referred to <strong>County Personnel (Employment Agency) Ltd v. Alan R. Pulver &amp; Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20WLR%20916" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 WLR 916</a>, there, Bingham LJ (as he then was) said at 925H :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(4) While the general rule undoubtedly is that damages for tort or breach of contract are assessed as at the date of the breach (see,for example, <em>Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] A.C. 443</a>, 468 <em>per</em> Lord Wilberforce), this rule also should not be mechanistically applied in circumstances where assessment at another date may moreaccurately reflect the overriding compensatory rule.

Indeed, I believe the plaintiff had not lost Unit 908 until the auctionin 2001. Prior to the auction, there is no reason to believe that the situation could not have been rectified by the registrationof the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Although if the Vendor had become insolvent, the plaintiff would have to pay the disbursementsin bill no. 44278 again.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The plaintiff had had the enjoyment of the Property probably until at least February of 2001. The loss of the property was not discovereduntil November 2001. This action was commenced on 5 February 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> On the evidence, it seems that the value of Unit 908 has fallen since 1994 reaching a bottom in 2001, followed by a slight recoveryinto 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> I think it would not be fair to take a possibly lower figure and assessed damages either for February or March 2001 when Unit 908was auctioned. After all, the loss was not discovered until November 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> In all the circumstances, I believe the figure of HK$1,800,000 given as the market value as of February 2002 is the figure I shouldadopt. It is close enough to November 2001 although judging from evidence about the rental value the figure for November 2001 waslikely to be lower.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> The plaintiff also claims the sum of HK$332,766 which is the legal fees and taxes shown on bill no. 44278. I do not think the plaintiffis entitled to that sum. The figure of HK$1,800,000 compensates the plaintiff for the loss of Unit 908. The plaintiff had to acquireUnit 908 before it could lose it. To acquire Unit 908 HK$332,766 would have to be paid. The same applies to the claims for managementfee deposit, telephone charges, etc totally HK$173,451.52. In any event, the plaintiff had the use of Unit 908 (though it was leftunoccupied) until at least February 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Travelling expenses to Shanghai in November and December 2001. So far as the November trip was concerned, it seems that Miss Wongvisited the Property whilst on a pleasure trip to Shanghai with friends. She spent a total of HK$5,942. I think it would be fairto allow part of this sum. After all, on visiting the Property and discovering that it was under renovation by the new owner, sheconsulted Tsui. I will allow one third of this sum namely HK$1,981. As for the December 2001 trip, the expenses totalled HK$44,933.That included a watch for Mr Shing. I believe I should only award, one return air ticket, HK$3,284; four nights hotel accommodationat HK$1,940 and general expenses at HK$500 per day for four days.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Legal costs and court fees incurred by the plaintiff in proceedings against the Vendor in the Shanghai City No. 2 Intermediate People'sCourt of RMB84,783.
