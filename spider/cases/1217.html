He reported the leakage immediately to the Baguio Villa Management Office operated by International Property ManagementLimited (âIPMâ) requesting IPM to investigate the cause of water leakage in Flat 4A.  IPM recorded the complaint in the incidentsbook at the management office and the action of its staff in relation to the leakages at 4A and 5A.  The incidents book for the periodbetween 23 July 2008 and 28 August 2008 has been produced at pages 354 to 358 of Bundle B.  The incidents book is an independentrecord kept by the management office, it is accepted as an accurate record of the dates of the complaints and action taken by themanagement office staff.

The leakages continued between 27<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> of July.  Mr. Leung later found cracks appearing and water leaking from different points along the cracks and water marks appearedalong the top edge of the partition wall between the dining room and the guest bathroom and the adjoining ceiling.  On the eveningof 29 July 2008, he contacted Mr. Simon Chan of Wing Tai Engineering Company (âMr. Chanâ), the plumber and contractor who performedthe decoration work at Flat 4A in December 2005.  After Mr. Chan inspected Flat 4A to investigate the cause of water leakage, hebelieved the water leakage came from the upper floor Flat 5A owned and occupied by the Defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 30 July 2008, the IPM staff informed Mr. Leung that the supply of potable water to Flat 5A had been switched off the day beforeto check if the leakage would continue.  Mr. Leung found no noticeable improvement as water continued to trickle down from the ceilingat Flat 4A.  After Mr. Chan inspected Flat 5A again, he informed Mr. Leung the water leakage at 4A was caused by the leakage of theunder floor fresh water pipes in Flat 5A, he believed water was seeping through the floor slab of Flat 5A into the ceiling of Flat4A.  He advised Mr. Kam, the husband of the Defendant, to stop the water leakage from the floor. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  According to Mr. Leung, between 31 July and 1 to 3 August 2008, the water leakage problem had continued.  Cracks on the dining roomceiling extended further in different directions and water was dripping from a number of areas simultaneously and plaster was beginningto peel off.  He reported the problem to the management office.  In response to the complaint, the staff of IPM switched off thefresh water supply to Flat 5A between 31 July and 4 August 2008, however, there was no improvement to the water leakage at Flat 4A. Mr. Leung requested the Defendant to rectify the leakage problem in writing through his solicitor on 7 August 2008, but the leakageproblem did not abate.  On 14 August 2008, Mr. Leung consulted Forewin Consultants Limited, a firm of surveyors, to investigate thecause of water leakage. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It was Mr. Leungâs evidence that on 21 August 2008, he found the cracks on the ceiling had extended across the corridor into thebedroom and water marks were found in the bedroom ceiling and in the wardrobe.  On 28 August 2008, Mr. Leung found the leakage hadreduced when water stopped dripping from the ceiling.  On or about 25 September 2008, he found the problem of water leakage had completelysubsided and the water marks dried up although the cracks remained and the plaster and paint continued to peel off.  He requestedForewin Consultants Limited to inspect Flat 4A and to make an assessment of the damage and the cost of repair.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr. Leung claimed that due to the substantial damage caused by the water leakage into Flat 4A, he had to move out of Flat 4A andstayed in a hotel during the period of damage repair between 26 September and mid-October 2008.  The cost of repair and hotel expensesamounted to $104,641. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff produced two expert reports, the first one was from Mr. Simon Chan of Wing Tai Engineering Co., the second from ForewinConsultants Limited.  In his report of 11 August 2008, after inspection of Flats 4A, 5A and 6A, Mr. Chan concluded the water leakageat Flat 4A was caused by the leaking under floor fresh water pipe running from the guest bathroom through the corridor and the livingroom into the kitchen due to failure of maintenance (p. 113 of bundle A).  The report from Forewin Consultants Limited of 26 October2008 concluded that water leakage into Flat 4A was probably caused by leakages from the main flush water pipes and the potable watersupply pipes at Flat 5A. It recommended replacement of both potable and flush water supply pipes to stop leakages recurring. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Defence Case</u></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Kam, husband of the Defendant, gave evidence at the hearing.  At the time of the water leakage incident in July and August 2008he was living with his family at Flat 5A.  A few days before 23 July 2008, he found 3 water marks at Flat 5A and these marks hadgradually enlarged, they were found at:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   the partition wall between the guest bathroom and the living room measuring 2.5m x 1m long;</p>        <p>(2)   the horizontal water mark at the partition wall between the guest bathroom and the dining room measuring 0.5m x 1m; and</p>        <p>(3)   the horizontal mark on the wall of the dining room under the window frame measuring 0.5m x 1m. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  He reported the incident to the management office.  The staff at IPM confirmed after inspection of Flat 5A the water marks on thethree areas.  On 26 July, Mr. Kam learned from the management office that Flat 4A was complaining of water dripping from the ceiling. IPM suspected the water leakage had probably originated from Flat 5A and asked him to turn off the valve inside the guest bathroomat Flat 5A to suspend the fresh water supply to the guest bathroom. He did so, but was informed the condition at Flat 4A did notabate.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 27 July 2008, at the suggestion of IPM, the fresh water supply to Flat 5A was shut down during the daytime.  However, the waterleakage problem at Flat 4A did not stop.  Mr. Kam found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A still remained. On 29<sup>th</sup> July, the staff of IPM informed him that the situation at Flat 4A was deteriorating and suggested shutting down the fresh water supplyat Flat 5A entirely for most of the day leaving only a couple of hours during the morning and evening for water supply to Flat 5A. He complied with the request, but was informed that in spite of the shut down of the fresh water supply to Flat 5A, Flat 4Aâsleakage problem had continued, he also found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A had remained.  Mr. Kam therefore suspected thesource of water leakage to Flat 4A did not originate from the fresh water supply to Flat 5A. On 30 July 2008, at the request of Mr.Leung of Flat 4A, he allowed Mr. Chan to inspect Flat 5A to investigate the cause of leakage into Flat 4A.  Mr. Chan told him thewater leakage was caused by the under floor fresh water pipe at Flat 5A running from the guest bathroom through the living room intothe kitchen.  Mr. Chan also told him that the design of the building had such a fresh water pipe installed under the floor to supplyhot water to the kitchen. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 1 August 2008, Mr. Kam found a pool of water on the window sill in the living room, as water was running continuously from thewindow sill, he immediately reported it to the management office.  After Mr. Leung and Mr. Chan inspected Flat 5A on 2 August 2008,Mr. Chan insisted the water leakage at Flat 5A was caused by the fresh water pipe under the living room floor.  Mr. Kam, however,questioned this claim for the level of the water marks on the wall between the guest bathroom and the living room at Flat 5A hadby then risen to almost 8 feet above the floor level. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 4 August 2008, Mr. Choi of the management office visited Flat 5A to carry out a test on the valve of a water pipe found on theexternal wall of the kitchen of Flat 5A.  He confirmed the valve controlled the fresh water supply into Flat 5A after the test. Mr. Kam claimed he had confirmation from his contractor Mr. Au Yeung that there had been some modification work done to the freshwater supply pipes to Flat 5A resulting in the installation of fresh water supply pipes running along the external walls of the unitbefore Mr. Kam and his family moved into Flat 5A.  Consequently, the original fresh water supply pipe was abandoned before Mr. Kambecame a resident of Flat 5A. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 2 August 2008, Mr. Kam examined the watermarks at his home carefully and found water leaking from the ceiling to the floor atthe window.  As there was a curtain covering the area, he did not notice before the water marks from the ceiling to the bottom ofthe window covering part of the horizontal support column above the window.  He put a towel at the window sill to absorb the water,but as the amount of water was large, water continued to leak from the towel, he had to put two containers to collect the water fromtwo locations to hold the water from the window sill.  He also kept a record of the volume of water collected from the two containerstwice a day and he kept the management office informed of his recordings. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 3 August 2008, Mr. Kam and the management office obtained the consent of the owner of Flat 6C to examine the guest bathroom andliving room of Flat 6A. Mr. Kam claimed that he found a suspected leakage point at the guest bathroom of Flat 6A where the flushwater supply pipe was connected to the toilet inside the guest bathroom of Flat 6A.  On 7<sup>th</sup> August, he requested the management office to turn off the flush water supply to all units in Block A of the building between 1000to 1700 hours.  He found, after the flush water supply to all Block A units was suspended, water stopped leaking from the ceilingabove the window at Flat 5A.  On 14 August, a test to shut down the flush water supply to all Block A units in the building was conductedagain, Mr. Kam found the water leakage at Flat 5A had suspended and it resumed 50 minutes after the flush water supply was turnedback on.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 26 August 2008, Mr. Lee the owner of Flat 6A, after examining Flats 4A and 5A, instructed his contractor to install a temporaryvalve on the flush water supply pipe outside the guest bathroom of Flat 6A and turned off the supply.  Mr. Kam found on the nextday, the water leakage at the ceiling of Flat 5A had stopped.  However, the water leakage from the ceiling of Flat 4A had only diminished.On 28<sup>th</sup> August, Flat 4A reported the water leakage had subsided. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Kam after consulting his expert Trusty Surveyor, concluded that water leakages into Flats 5A and 4A was caused by the flushwater supply pipe to the guest bathroom of Flat 6A.  It was because flush water was leaking profusely from Flat 6A into Flat 5A andaccumulated on the floor of Flat 5A.  As a result, the timber flooring in Flat 5A was badly damaged, buckled and became detachedfrom the floor.  He also admitted that he found water coming out from a couple of timber floor joints.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Defence claimed that the water leakage was caused by Flat 6A not Flat 5A and that the Defendant had rendered all necessary assistanceto the management office and to Flat 4A to locate the source of water leakage.  Furthermore, the Defendant had also obtained assistancefrom experts to resolve the water leakage problem and that Flat 5A had also suffered serious damage due to water leakage from Flat6A.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Expert Reports</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Both the Plaintiffs and the Defendant produced a number of expert reports.  The first report came from the Plaintiffâs plumberMr. Simon Chan on 11 August 2008 with a supplemental report on 20 January 2010 and a report from their surveyor Forewin ConsultantsLimited on 26 October 2008 with a supplemental report on 20 January 2010.  The Defenceâs expert Trusty Surveyors prepared a reporton 3 October 2008 followed by a supplementary report on 12 November 2009.  On the direction of Master Lo, the partiesâ expertsprepared a joint report on 18 November 2010, it is a joint report of Mr. Man Pui Kwan of Forewin Consultants Limited, Simon ChanMan Leung of Wing Tai Engineering and Mr. Lau Wing Wai Patrick of Trusty Surveyors Hong Kong Limited.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Paragraph 1.3 of the joint report stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a) there was agreed opinion of fact that at the material times water was leaking from the floor of Flat 5A, Block 22, Upper BaguioVilla, Hong Kong (âFlat 5Aâ) into Flat 4A, Block 22, Upper Baguio Villa, Hong Kong (âFlat 4Aâ).</p>        <p class="quote">(b) there were disagreed opinions on the causes of the water leakage;</p>        <p class="quote">(c) have not been discussed subject: whether the Flat 5Aâs negligence caused the water leakages;</p>        <p class="quote">(d) the quantum of damages was agreed at HK$39,805.20.</p>        <p class="quote">(p. 216 of Bundle A)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Under paragraph 2 of the joint report on water leaking from Flat 5A into Flat 4A, paragraph 2(a) stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âExperts mutually agreed there is a potable water supply pipe for Flat 5A running horizontally on the external walls of Flat 5Aand it supplies cold water to the kitchen of Flat 5A. (p. 217 of Bundle A)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Paragraph 2.1(a) of the joint report repeated the Defendantâs expert opinion in his report admitting there were water stain marks,cracks and peeled off paint found on the ceilings and high level of walls in the living/dining room of 4A during inspection on 19September 2008.  Paragraph 2.1(b) and (c) repeated the condition of water drippings, cracks, water marks, mould and blistered paintfound on the ceilings and walls in the living and dining room of 4A on 14 August 2008 and that on 29 July 2008 the ceilings at theliving room, guest bedroom and master bedroom were seriously damaged, water at the ceiling was leaking at the rate of 20 drops persecond.  Paragraph 2.1(b) and (c) repeated the Plaintiffâs expert report when the two experts inspected Flat 4A on relevant days. In paragraph 2.2(a), the Defendantâs expert report attributed the water seepage problem in Flat 4A to the water flooding on thefloor of Flat 5A due to leakage from Flat 6A.  While paragraph 2.2(b) recorded the Plaintiffâs expert report stating the causeof water leakage at 4A was due to the flooded floor at 5A.  The photographs taken on 19 September 2008 at 5A in Appendix 3 of theTrusty Survey Report showed the wet and buckled timber flooring at 5A due to water accumulation. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Paragraph 3 of the joint report set out the differences in the Plaintiffsâ and Defendantâs experts:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDisagreed opinion on causes of leakage</p>        <p class="quote">(a) Plaintiffâs experts are of the opinion that the cause of water seepage of Flat 4A was due to the leaking potable water supplypipes of Flat 5A for hot water embedded in the concrete floor of Flat 5A as described in paragraph 3.1(a) to (e) hereinafter;</p>        <p class="quote">(b) Defendantâs expert is of the opinion that the cause of water seepage of Flat 4A was due to water flooding on the floor of Flat5A as described in paragraph 2.2(a) to (b) hereinabove as a result of water leakage from the flush water supply pipe of Flat 6A withinthe wall of the guest bathroom of Flat 6A as described in paragraph 3.2(a) hereinafter.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Clearly, the Plaintiff and the Defenceâs experts could not agree on the cause of the water leakage into Flat 4A.  The Plaintiffâsexperts based their opinions on the area of moisture found, the damp and buckling timber floor at 5A as evidence that there was waterleakage at the under floor fresh water supply pipe between the guest bathroom and the kitchen, that the buckled timber floor outsidethe guest bathroom and the corridor demonstrated the source of the water leakage (p. 225 of Bundle A).  The Defence expert on theother hand, pointed to the fact that after Flat 6A fixed its flush water supply pipe on 26 August 2008, Flat 5Aâs water leakagesuspended on the next day and Flat 4A water leakage also ceased on 28 August 2008.  It showed therefore the sole cause of leakagecame from the flush water supply at Flat 6A.  The Defence expert Mr. Lau disagreed with the Plaintiffâs experts that there wasa fresh water supply pipe underneath the timber floor of 5A running from the guest bathroom to the kitchen as he found an electricwater heater in the kitchen and gas water heaters in the two bathrooms in Flat 5A.  There were no approved plans of Flat 5A to showthere was an under floor fresh water supply pipe installed by the developer, the contractor or the architect.  Furthermore, therewere fresh water supply pipes running along the external walls of the unit from the mains to the kitchen at Flat 5A, thus rulingout the usage of the alleged under floor fresh water supply pipe to supply hot water from the guest bathroom to the kitchen.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Plaintiffâs expert claimed that if the flush water pipe at 6A was leaking flush water into 5A to cause flooding on the livingroom and the corridor floor at Flat 5A, the living room ceiling of Flat 5A should also have leaked due to accumulation of water fromFlat 6A, damaging the Flat 5A ceiling in the process.  However, there were no leakages at the ceilings of Flat 5A while the timberflooring at Flat 5A was wet through causing the floor boards to buckle and water accumulation at the base of the timber flooring. The flooding caused leakages into the ceiling of Flat 4Aâs living room and the adjoining wall of the guest bathroom.  When theunit A flush water supply was suspended from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on 7 August 2008, water seepages at Flat 5A ceased within one hour,but the water seepage at Flat 4A failed to abate.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  According to Mr. Chan, all units at the Baguio Villa estate were originally installed with gas water heaters in the kitchen.  Theseheaters were abandoned because they failed to comply with the requirements of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department. It was Mr. Chanâs evidence that in order to supply hot water to the kitchen, units in the building were installed with fresh watersupply pipes embedded in the floor between the guest bathroom and the kitchen.  Mr. Chan pointed to photographs 10 to 11 and 16 to18 of Appendix 3 of the Defenceâs expert report and Appendix I of the joint report showing cold and hot water supply pipes fromthe gas heater at the guest bathroom at the external wall of the guest bathroom of the building leading back into the floor slabof Flat 5A.  Mr. Kam disagreed with Mr. Chan, he pointed out that the floor slab of Flat 5A was below the point of entry of the freshwater pipes indicated by Mr. Chan in the photograph.  He believed they led back to the bath tub area rather than the floor slab ofFlat 5A (p. 259 of Bundle A). </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr. Simon Chan is a licensed plumber, he admitted in Court he is a relative of the Plaintiffs.  He was contacted by Mr. Leung whenwater leakage was found in Flat 4A and had an opportunity to inspect Flat 4A soon after leakages appeared in Flat 4A.  He had alsohad an opportunity between 27 July and early August 2008 to inspect Flats 5A and 6A.  He claimed he had ruled out the water leakageat Flat 4A had come from Flat 6A because he had visited Flat 6A on 1 August and found the bathroom floor of Flat 6A to be dry.  Hehad also checked the supply of potable water at Flat 6A and found there was no running water because the owners of Flat 6A had turnedoff the fresh water mains and the unit was vacant at the time. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  He conducted a test on 29 July 2008 at Flat 4A by turning off the potable water supply to Flat 5A, he performed the same test againon 30 July 2008 when the management office accidently turned off the potable water supply at Flat 5A instead of the flush water supplyand found water leakages had reduced, therefore, he concluded the cause of the water leakage into Flat 4A was due to the broken freshwater supply pipes concealed under the Flat 5A floor slab.  Although he did not check under the floor boards of Flat 5A to see whetherthere was indeed an embedded fresh water supply pipe running from the guest bathroom to the kitchen, he based his claim from hisexperience as a plumber at Baguio Villa estate where many units had the same embedded fresh water pipes to supply hot water to thekitchen from the guest bathroom.  He agreed the Defendantâs photographs showed an electric water heater inside a cupboard in thekitchen, but he claimed the electric water heater shown in the photograph was not in use because the electric power supply to theBaguio Villa units were insufficient to support the kitchen electric water heater and the air conditioners in the same property ifthey were used at the same time. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr. Man of Forewin Consultants prepared his report based on information given to him by Mr. Simon Chan and from his own observationson 14 August and 25 September 2008.  He was not told that Mr. Chan had wrongly reported that instead of the fresh water supply itwas the flush water supply at Flat 5A that was suspended during the daytime and the leakage at Flat 5A had immediately suspendedon 7 August 2008.  The same test to shut down the flush water supply to Unit A of the whole Block between 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. was repeatedon 14 August 2008, the management office and Mr. Kam found the living room floor on Flat 5A had begun to dry up.  When the flushwater supply was turned on again, water started seeping into Flat 5A at 5:50 p.m.  However, the leakage at 4A did not stop.  Undercross-examination, Mr. Man admitted he was not aware until 5 to 7 July 2010 that there were fresh water pipes running along the externalwalls of Flat 5A or there was an electric water heater in the kitchen of Flat 5A.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Analysis</u></p>    <p class="heading">(1)    <u>Whether the water was leaking through the Defendantâs premises into the Plaintiffâs premises into the Plaintiffâs premises?</u></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Based on the evidence adduced and from the expertsâ report, the answer to this question must be yes.  The next question is whetherthe water seepage was from the fresh water supply pipe embedded underneath the floor board of Flat 5A or was it from the flush watersupply from Flat 6A running through Flat 5A into Flat 4A?  As can be seen from the photographs and from the evidence of the witnesses,it is not disputed the floor of Flat 5A at the window and the corridor outside the guest bathroom was soaked with water.  Water stainson the timber flooring can clearly be seen in the photographs.  Mr. Leung, his plumber Mr. Chan and Mr. Kam all agreed the Flat 5Aflooring around the living room and the corridor near the guest bathroom was wet with the timber flooring buckling.  The Defendantâsexpert Mr. Lau measured the wall partition at the guest bathroom, the living room and along the corridor, the moisture level wasextremely high.  The same level of moisture was found in the timber floor outside the guest bathroom along the corridor.  The ceilingand walls at Flat 4A had begun to show signs of water seepage on 27 July 2008.  The inference therefore is, the water seepage musthave come through the Defendantâs premises.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>(2) Whether the Defendantâs negligence caused the water leakage?</u></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Para. 20-135 and para. 20-136 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 20<sup>th</sup> ed. provided:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen a shop in an arcade was let to a tenant, and water from the roof of the arcade got into the shop owing to an accumulationof rubbish in the pipe by which the water was carried into the sewer, it was held that the landlord was not liable in the absenceof negligence, as the arrangements for carrying the water from the glass roof to the sewer were for the joint benefit of the tenantand the landlord.</p>        <p class="quote"><b>Negligence in relation to cisterns</b> If the landlord retains control of a cistern for the supply of water to flats in his building, he is not liable to his tenants fora burst in one of the water pipes, or an escape of water from the cistern, unless he is negligent.

The Plaintiff claimedthe Defendant had failed to maintain the fresh water supply pipe embedded in the floor slab between the guest bathroom and the kitchenat Flat 5A resulting in the leakage to Flat 4A. The experts agreed that fresh water supply pipes had been installed along the externalwalls of Flat 5A, they can be seen in the photographs produced.  Mr. Kam did not agree there was a fresh water pipe embedded underneaththe floor from the guest bathroom to the kitchen in Flat 5A.  This claim of embedded fresh water pipe to supply hot water from thegas heater in the guest bathroom to the kitchen of Flat 5A had not been established.  It was a bare assertion of Mr. Chan who claimedfrom his own experience as a plumber.  The burden is on the Plaintiffs to show there was a leaking fresh water supply pipe buriedunderneath the floor boards of Flat 5A in July and August 2008.  Furthermore, the independence of Mr. Chan has been challenged ashe is related to the Plaintiff.  Mr. Manâs expert evidence is also tainted by the faulty information given to him by Mr. Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The management office incidents report recorded the water leakage into Flat 5A had ceased when the flush water supply in unit Aof Block 22 was shut down on 7 August and 14 August 2008.  Even though water leakage into Flat 4A had continued, it was indisputablethat the leakage of water into Flat 5A had come to a halt and leakage reappeared 50 minutes after the flush water supply was turnedback on.  This indicated the leakage into Flat 5A came from the flush water supply system.  Furthermore, when on 26 August 2008 uponthe installation of a temporary valve at the flush water supply pipe of Flat 6A to shut down the supply, the water seepage problemat Flat 5A abated on the next day.  The management office staff observed that on that day, water leakage into Flat 4A had also sloweddown.  The water leakage finally stopped in Flat 4A on 28 August 2008 the day after.  The aforesaid phenomenon indicated the waterleakage into Flat 5A was caused by the flush water pipe leakage at Flat 6A. The question that follows is, whether the Flat 6A flushwater leakage was the sole cause of water seepage in Flat 4A?  Unfortunately, with the limited and unsatisfactory expert informationproduced at trial and the failure to take extensive scientific tests and investigations for a full explanation on the cause or causesof the water leakage into Flat 4A, there is no clear answer.  On this basis, and on the basis that after the Flat 6A flush watersupply was shut down, no further leakages took place at Flat 4A, I am not satisfied the Plaintiffs have succeeded in proving theleakages at Flat 4A was caused by the Defendantâs negligence and that the accumulation of water on the floor of Flat 5A was dueto a leaking fresh water pipe embedded on the floor of Flat 5A.  Nor am I convinced that the Defendant was liable for causing a nuisanceor annoyance to the Plaintiff in breach of clause 10(c) of the Deed of Mutual Covenant when the negligence of the Defendant is notproved.  I am satisfied the Defendant had tried to locate the source of the leakage and had acted reasonably. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On the aforesaid basis, I dismissed the Plaintiffsâ claim against the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Costs to follow the event.
