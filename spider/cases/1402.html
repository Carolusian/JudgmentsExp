After the close of the prosecution case, the prosecution accepted that the1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant had no case to answer in respect of charge 4.  After hearing submissions, the Magistrate (Mr Gary Lam) ruled that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> defendants had a case to answer in respect of charge 1, and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants had a case to answer in respect of charges 2 and 3 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The defendants elected not to give evidence.

On Sunday, 3 June 2007 at around 11:40 am, a group of about 26 persons arrived at theoutside of the entrance of Shuk Yuen Building, No 2 Green Lane, to present a petition and hold a demonstration.  It was organisedby a housing concern group.  Shuk Yuen Building is a private residential development.  It comprises 6 blocks of low-rise multi-storeybuildings (Blocks A to F).  There is only one entrance to the development, which is used both by the residents/visitors as well asvehicles.  A pair of metal gates which open inwards are installed at the entrance.  The metal gates are operated electrically bythe caretaker whose booth is located immediately behind the gates, which lead onto a private driveway.  The driveway leads to a commonopen space round a corner several hundred metres away, where residents park their cars.  On one side of the open space are BlocksC and D.  Mr Suen, to whom the concern group planned to make the petition on some housing matter, resided at a flat in Block D atthe time.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The metal gates were closed at the time when the group of âpetitionersâ (as they have been called) arrived at the entrance tothe development.  They remained closed until around 12:05 pm when a residentâs vehicle returned to the development.  The caretakeropened the metal gates to allow the vehicle in.  Seizing upon the opportunity, the petitioners went inside the development throughthe gates at the same time.  The several policemen who were at the scene to maintain order were unable to prevent the petitionersfrom entering the gates.  But they immediately formed a âhuman chainâ on the driveway to keep the petitioners from approachingthe common open space.  In those circumstances, the petitioners assembled at that part of the driveway near the entrance.  Usingloudhailers, they shouted slogans and demanded to see Mr Suen.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At around 12:20 pm, the 4<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>defendant (a legislative counsellor who is widely known as âLong Hairâ) arrived at the scene by taxi to support the petitioners. He entered the development through the entrance (the gates had remained open after the petitionersâ entry) and it is plain fromthe evidence that he took an active part in assisting the petitioners in their cause that day.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The evidence also shows that the police officers present had been asking the petitioners to stay where they were, whilst they would,so they said, find out for the petitioners what Mr Suenâs attitude towards the petitioners was.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  However, by around 12:51 pm, some of the petitioners had run out of their patience and, led by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, they charged the police cordon.  Some of them managed to break through the police line.  The police officers withdrewdown the driveway and eventually the petitioners reached the common space at the end of the driveway and assembled at the groundfloor (common) entrance to Blocks C and D.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The prosecutionâs case was that the assembly which the six defendants participated in turned into an unlawful one when they tookpart in charging the police cordon.  The events were video-recorded and the recordings were produced and played by consent at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In convicting the defendants of charge 1, the Magistrate mainly relied on the recordings produced by the parties, as well as theevidence of the civilian witnesses, namely PW7 (Madam Poon), a resident in the development, and PW1 (Mr Chan), the caretaker.  Littleweight was placed on the evidence of the police officers called by the prosecution and by the defence. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In essence, the Magistrate rejected the defenceâs argument that at the material time, the defendants were lawfully exercisingtheir constitutional right of assembly and right to freedom of expression (whilst inside the residential development).  The Magistratefound that the defendants were trespassers and as such they did not enjoy any of the constitutional rights in question whilst withinthe private residential premises of others.  The Magistrate therefore rejected as irrelevant arguments that the police had breachedits positive duty to assist the petitioners in the exercise of their rights and that the police was obstructing or interfering withthe petitionersâ exercise of their rights.  The Magistrate further rejected as immaterial the argument that the police had misledthe petitioners into believing that it was contacting Mr Suen for his response.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  As to the defendantsâ commission of the offence, relying on the video recordings, the Magistrate found that each of them tookpart in charging the police cordon, which was lawfully formed by the police on the driveway.  He found that all defendants had thenecessary <i>mens rea</i> for the commission of the offence.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In these appeals, various perfected grounds are relied on by counsel to challenge the convictions and some of them overlap witheach other.  The grounds raised by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant are covered by the perfected grounds.  The perfected grounds, as they have been developed in argument, are dealt with underdifferent headings below.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3   Limits of freedom of assembly and of expression â grounds 1(a), (c), (d), (e) &amp; (j) and 2</p>    <p class="heading">3.1 Defendantsâ  arguments</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It is plain that central to the defendantsâ arguments is the contention that their constitutional right of assembly and rightto freedom of expression did not stop at the entrance to the private residential development, regardless of whether they were permittedto enter the same or not.  In other words, whilst they maintain that they were not trespassers at the material time (by reason ofsome implied permission to enter and remain), but even if they were, that would not have put to an end their constitutional rightsin question.  That being the case, it is necessary, the defendants argue, to examine whether the police has breached its positiveduty to assist the petitioners in the exercise of their constitutional rights, whether it has unlawfully obstructed or interferedwith their exercise of those rights, and therefore whether the defendants are guilty of unlawful assembly under section 18 of thePublic Order Ordinance which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(1)  When 3 or more persons, assembled together, conduct themselves in a disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative mannerintended or likely to cause any person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace, or willby such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace, they are an unlawful assembly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(2) It is immaterial that the original assembly was lawful if being assembled, they conduct themselves in such a manner as aforesaid.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(3) Any person who takes part in an assembly which is an unlawful assembly by virtue of subsection (1) shall be guilty of the offenceof unlawful assembly and shall be liable â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for 5 years; and</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">(b) on summary conviction, to a fine of $5,000 and to imprisonment for 3 years.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Plainly, whether the police was duly executing its duty, or was wrongfully obstructing or interfering with the petitionersâ lawfulexercise of their constitutional rights, would greatly affect the question of whether there was, or was likely to be, a âbreachof the peaceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Hectar Pun for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants, Miss Annie Leung appearing for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant acting in person, all argue that the right of assembly and the right to freedom of expression do not stop at the boundaryof a privately owned property, even if no permission is given by the owner of the property for the individuals in question exercisingthose rights to enter or remain in the property.  They argue that when those rights conflict with the ownerâs right to his privateproperty, a sort of âproportionality testâ or âbalancing exerciseâ has to be conducted in order to determine the extent orlimits of the individualsâ right of assembly and right to freedom of expression whilst within the ownerâs private property. They argue that this is a fact-sensitive exercise, which must depend on the entire circumstances of each individual case.  No hardand fast rule can be laid down.  Indeed, even in respect of this case, Mr Pun is unable or reluctant to tell the Court what exactlyconstitute the limits of the petitionersâ rights whilst within the private residential development in question, or, put anotherway, where, physically within the private residential development in question, must the petitioners stop, in order not to overstepthe legal boundary and render the exercise of their constitutional rights unlawful.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3.2 Preliminary observations</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Counsel rely on some authorities to support their arguments.  I will presently return to these authorities.  However, I do not believethat the law is as uncertain and the result as unpredictable as counselâs arguments would suggest.  Such a result is not only unsatisfactoryfrom the perspective of a private residential owner, who would not be able to tell in advance which part of his property is freefrom intrusion by others in the exercise of their âlawfulâ constitutional right of assembly and right to freedom of expression,but it is also unsatisfactory to those seeking to exercise their constitutional rights.  For they would be in danger of exceedingthe legal limits of their constitutional rights once they enter into private residential premises.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I do not believe that this represents the state of the law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3.3 Relevant constitutional provisions</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Some provisions in the Basic Law are highly relevant:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âArticle 5</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">The socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalistsystem and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.</p>        <p class="quote">Article 6</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall protect the right of private ownership of property in accordance with law.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â¦</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Article 27</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and of publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of processionand of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â¦</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Article 29</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">The homes and other premises of Hong Kong residents shall be inviolable.

Likewise, article 16(2) of the Bill guarantees the right to freedom of expression.  However, article 16(3)(a) expressly providesthat the right is subject to restrictions that are provided by law and are necessary âfor respect of the rightsâ¦ of othersâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the present context where one is concerned with a private residential development, various rights of the co-owners of the developmentare involved.  They are not mere common law rights to property.  They are constitutional rights also found in the Hong Kong Billof Rights as well as Chapter III of the Basic Law which govern the âfundamental rightsâ of the residents of the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region.  In particular, article 29 of the Basic Law specifically provides that âthe homes and other premisesâof Hong Kong residents shall be âinviolableâ, and âarbitrary or unlawful search of, or intrusion into, a residentâs homeor other premises shall be prohibitedâ.  In the same vein, article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights clearly stipulates that noone shall be subjected to unlawful interference with his privacy or home, and everyone has the right to the protection of the lawagainst such interference.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Furthermore, article 105 under Chapter V of the Basic Law expressly states that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall,in accordance with law, protect the right of individuals to, amongst other things, the use of their property.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  All this is not surprising because article 5 of the Basic Law, under Chapter I (General Principles), specifically guarantees thatthe socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, whereas âthe previouscapitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 yearsâ.  It is trite that a hallmark of a capitalist society isits high respect for personal ownership and property rights.  This finds expression in article 6 of the Basic Law which requiresthe Special Administrative Region to protect the right of private ownership of property in accordance with law.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Manfred Nowak, in his classic work, <i>UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights CCPR Commentary</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> revised edition), explains the ârights and freedoms of othersâ exception to article 21 of the ICCPR (on which article 17 of theHong Kong Bill of Rights is based) as follows (at pp 493-494):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<i>e) Rights and Freedoms of Others</i></p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">This protected interest can be found in all limitation clauses in the Covenant, but in contrast to Art. 18(3), it relates not onlyto fundamental rights.  The limits on freedom of assembly which stem from the protection of the rights of personality of others (inparticular, honour and reputation) are the same as those on freedom of expression and information.  To be taken into considerationwith assemblies are the rights of passers-by, as well as those of participants, to personal safety and physical integrity, whichhave been dealt with in the context of public safety.  In addition, the prohibition of advocacy of hatred set down in Art. 20(2)should be mentioned in this regard.  However, States parties are under an obligation of protection, and only when this has failedis the restriction or breaking up of the assembly permissible ultima ratio.  As with freedom of movement, <i>freedom of assembly is subject to limitations for the protection of private property of others</i>.<sup> </sup> Art. 21 protects assemblies on private property or in private buildings to the same extent as on public streets, squares or in publicassembly rooms.  However, <i>the prior approval of the owner is necessary for all property and buildings not freely accessible to the public, regardless of a possiblerequirement of a public license</i>.  This also applies to publicly owned buildings and property.  However, the State is subject here to a certain obligation to fulfil,as results from the character of freedom of assembly as a political freedom, and, especially, from the prohibition of discrimination. For instance, the private owner of a performance hall need not make available his or her assembly rooms to a political organizationwith which he or she is uncomfortable, whereas Art. 2(1) requires States parties to ensure freedom of assembly without distinctionas to political or other opinion, i.e., not to discriminate for this or any other listed reason in making available public assemblyrooms.  As with freedom of movement, protection of private property must not lead to a complete undermining of real possibilitiesfor assembling.  In such cases, States parties must provide sufficient public facilities for exercising freedom of assembly.â (emphasisadded)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In Hong Kong, the position is an <i>a fortiori</i> one.

In that case, an environmental group campaignedagainst a plan to build on the only public playing field near a town centre.  It set about collecting signatures for a petition topersuade the local council to reject the project.  It tried to set up stands in a privately owned shopping mall in the town centre. However, it was prevented from doing so by security guards employed by the company which owned the shopping mall, as the companytook a strictly neutral stance on all political and religious issues.  Relying on articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention onHuman Rights on the rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly respectively, members of the environmental group complainedthat they had been prevented from meeting in their town centre to share information and ideas about the proposed building plans.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  After considering the domestic position in the United Kingdom as well as the situations in the United States and Canada, the EuropeanCourt observed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â46    The Court would observe that, though the cases from the United States in particular illustrate an interesting trend in accommodatingfreedom of expression to privately owned property open to the public, the US Supreme Court has refrained from holding that thereis a federal constitutional right of free speech in a privately owned shopping mall.  Authorities from the individual states showa variety of approaches to the public and private law issues that have arisen in widely differing factual situations.  It cannotbe said that there is as yet any emerging consensus that could assist the Court in its examination in this case concerning Art. 10of the Convention.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">47    <i>That provision, notwithstanding the acknowledged</i><i> </i>importance of freedom of expression, does not bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of that right.  While it is true that demographic,social, economic and technological developments are changing the ways in which people move around and come into contact with eachother, <i>the Court is not persuaded that this requires the automatic creation of rights of entry to private property</i>, or even, necessarily, to all publicly owned property (Government offices and ministries, for instance).  Where however the bar onaccess to property has the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression or it can be said that the essenceof the right has been destroyed, the Court would not exclude that a positive obligation could arise for the State to protect theenjoyment of Convention rights by regulating property rights.  The corporate town, where the entire municipality was controlled bya private body, might be an example.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  On the facts, the Court did not consider that the members of the environmental group could claim that they were, as a result ofthe refusal of the private company which owned the shopping mall, effectively prevented from communicating their views to their fellowcitizens.  There were other means and ways to express their views, and their argument that they were unable otherwise to exercisetheir freedom of expression in a meaningful manner was rejected (para 48).  Based on largely identical considerations, the Courtfound that there was no breach of the right of peaceful assembly either (para 52).</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In <i>Appleby</i>,para 27, the European Court of Human Rights noted that in the United States, the US Supreme Court had taken the position that theFirst Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, does not prevent a private shopping centre owner from prohibitingdistribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations: <i>Lloyd Corp v Tanner</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=407%20US%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">407 US 551</a> (1972).  This did not, however, prevent state constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the Federal <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centreto which the public was invited.  This did not, the European Court noted, violate the property rights of the shopping centre ownerso long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions:<i>Pruneyard Shopping Center v Robins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=447%20US%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">447 US 74</a> (1980), a case turning on the California State <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Like <i>Appleby, Pruneyard</i> was a case involving a privately owned shopping centre in California.  The decision turned on the âmore expansive libertiesâgranted under Californiaâs free speech clause, which goes beyond the protection guaranteed under article 10 of the European Conventionor article 19 of the ICCPR.  That notwithstanding, in the subsequent case of <i>Golden Gateway Center v Golden Gateway Tenants Assn</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%2026%20Cal%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 26 Cal 4</a><sup>th </sup>1013<a>[1]</a>, the California Supreme Court refused to extend the right to freedom of expression to activities within a privately owned apartmentcomplex.  Distinguishing <i>Pruneyard</i>, the California Supreme Court held that a tenancy association did not have a right under the California <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to distribute a newsletter in a privately owned apartment complex.  The Court stated that state action was necessary for a violationof the California free speech clause but that no state action existed in the case because the apartment complex was not fully opento the public.  The Court stressed that in <i>Pruneyard</i>, the shopping centre concerned was functionally equivalent to a âdowntown or central business districtâ, which is a traditionalpublic forum.  The public had been invited to âcongregate freelyâ in the centre, which had a âpublic characterâ.  The Courtconcluded that private property must be public in character before Californiaâs free speech clause may apply, and that under thatclause a private property ownerâs actions will constitute state action only if the property is freely and openly accessible tothe public.  On the facts, the Court noted that the apartment complex did not allow general public access to the property and thelandlord employed security guards and doormen to limit access to residential tenants and their invitees only.  The emphasis on privacyand security was clear in each lease.  (See also William J Emanuel, <i>Union trespassers roam the corridors of California hospitals: Is a return to the rule of law possible?</i>  (2009) 30(4) Whittier LR 723â782.)</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Like <i>Golden Gateway Center</i>, the present case concerns purely private residential premises, and <i>Pruneyard</i> is wholly distinguishable (not to mention that the California free speech clause involved there is more expansive in scope).  Indeedwhen compared with <i>Appleby</i>, the position here is an <i>a fortiori</i> one.   In the instant case, there is no question of the private residential property performing the function of a town hall or similarpublic or âquasi publicâ venue in which individuals may claim the right to exercise their freedom of expression or assembly ina reasonable manner.  To the contrary, on the evidence, the emphasis on privacy and security is plain.  Nor is one concerned withcommercial premises, which are let to a government department or public authority for its official use<a>[2]</a>.  What this case is concerned with is purely private residential property.  It is true that a high-ranking government official resideswithin the premises.  However, in my view, that does not make any difference to the analysis, because the premises are occupied bythe high-ranking official as his private residence.  Moreover, the high-ranking official here does not occupy the entire privateresidential development by himself.  As is common in Hong Kong, he is just one of the many co-owners/co-occupiers in the severalmulti-storey blocks comprising the residential development.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Furthermore, in the context of Hong Kong at least, by the nature of things, it is next to impossible to imagine a situation wherenot to permit entry to a private residential development to exercise the right of assembly or the right to freedom of expressionwould be tantamount to depriving those intending to exercise such rights of any opportunities to exercise them in any meaningfulmanner, thereby amounting to an effective denial of the rights.  In Hong Kong, opportunities to exercise those rights in public places,including the public street that Shuk Yuen Building faces, are abound.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3.6 Cases concerning activities in public places</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  For these reasons, I do not consider the cases cited to the Court by counsel for the defendants helpful to the present discussion. Most of the authorities cited concerned the exercise of the right of assembly and the right to freedom of expression in <i>public places</i> or places of a âpublic characterâ.  Thus the New Zealand case, <i>Police v Beggs</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20NZLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 NZLR 615</a>, heavily relied on by counsel, concerned a very different situation from ours.  The case involved a protest by 300 students in Parliamentgrounds.  Their intention was to protest against possible changes to tertiary education funding or structures.  They demanded thatthe Minister of Education address them from the steps of Parliament.  No specific permission had been sought for the protest in Parliamentgrounds, but their entry onto the grounds was not impeded.  Subsequently, they were told to leave by the Speakerâs staff, who hadbeen delegated the task of overseeing protests in the grounds.  They refused, and, after warning, were arrested by the police fortrespass.  The New Zealand High Court, in the course of judgment, made various observations on how the Speaker might exercise hispower to ask protesters to leave Parliament grounds, without infringing the protestersâ relevant rights under the New Zealand Billof Rights.  The Court applied the test of reasonableness and discussed various considerations relevant to the application of thetest (pp 627-632).</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In my view, <i>Police v Beggs</i> is a wholly distinguishable case.  In that case, one was concerned with protesting in Parliament grounds, a natural public forumfor assembly and expression of opinion, rather than within the private residential premises of private citizens.  The functions andduties of the government (including the executive and legislature) were engaged, in addition to the Stateâs right and power aslandowner.  Citizensâ rights <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> that of their governmentâs in a democratic society were involved.  In those circumstances, it is not surprising that the Courtwould resort to the reasonableness test to resolve the conflicts between different rights. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  However, in the present case, one is concerned with a private residential development.  Private property rights are at stake.  Thepremises are occupied entirely for private residential premises.  One is not concerned with Government property or Legislative Councilgrounds (that are generally open to the public), where one could with little restriction stage protests and demonstrations.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In those circumstances, <i>Police v Beggs</i> is of no assistance in the present context.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3.7 Debates over definition of âhomeâ </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Counsel for the defendants argue that in the present case, one is concerned with the private driveway within the development, ratherthan the flat in which Mr Suen resides.  They contend that there is a distinction between the common areas of a residential developmentand the flat of which a resident enjoys exclusive right to possession and enjoyment.  It is only the latter which qualifies as theâhomeâ of the resident, within the meaning of article 14(1) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights which protects against unlawful interferencewith oneâs âhomeâ.  Counsel refer the Court to overseas cases on the meaning of a âhomeâ in different contexts.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In this regard, I believe the correct position has been summarised by <i>Nowak, op cit</i>, at p 399:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<i>3. Home</i></p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">As emphasized at the outset, the protection of home in the 19<sup>th </sup>century represented the quintessence of bourgeois privacy.  That which took place outside the private home belonged to the area ofpublic life and thus was subject to legal norms and societal rules of conduct.  Events âwithin oneâs own four wallsâ were,on the contrary, private, i.e., hidden, secret from the public.  Only there could the individual pursue his or her self-realizationin a manner corresponding to his or her needs and desires.  The word âhomeâ â or the British saying âmy home is my castleââ also gives expression to the correlation between protection of the home and the right of property, a relationship essential forthe bourgeois society of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in which the extent of private ownership determined the extent of individual privacy.  The various meanings associated withthe word âhomeâ convey a feeling of familiarity, shelter and security.  In this manner, the home symbolizes a place of refugewhere one can develop and enjoy domestic peace, harmony and warmth without fear of disturbance.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">The protection of the âhomeâ (âdomicileâ) relates not only to dwellings in the true sense but also to all types of housesregardless of legal title (ownership, rental, leasing, etc.) or nature of use (main domicile, weekend house, garden house, etc.). <i>The borders of the home run together with that area over which ownership (or any other legal title) extends, i.e., also to the garageand garden.</i><sup> </sup> Even a camping trailer or a house boat are covered by the protection of Art. 17.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In my view, the fact that in Hong Kong, most people live in buildings and developments that are under co-ownership does not meanthat the common areas within the land and buildings in question do not form part of the âhomesâ of the co-owners and occupiersof those buildings and land, for the purposes of protection of their privacy under article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.  Inmy view, their right to privacy must be given a generous interpretation.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In <i>Brooker v Police</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20NZLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 NZLR 91</a>, the Supreme Court of New Zealand had to consider a defendantâs purported exercise of the right to freedom of expression guaranteedunder the New Zealand Bill of Rights on the grass verge of the public road facing a police constableâs house with whom the defendanthad a grudge.  He knew that the police constable had been on duty overnight and was resting in her house.  He had rung and knockeduntil the constable open the door and told him to go away.  He then retreated to the grass verge of the public road where he sangsongs in a normal singing voice and played his guitar while displaying a placard referring to police conduct.  He was arrested andwas eventually charged for disorderly behaviour. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  On the facts of the case, the majority of the Court found (McGrath and Thomas JJ dissenting), that the defendantâs conduct couldnot be said to be disorderly.  Nonetheless, McGrath J, in a particular illuminating judgment, discussed the inter-relationship betweenthe freedom of expression and the protection of privacy:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â[123]<b> </b> Privacy is âan aspect of human autonomy and dignityâ.  Although, as a police constable, the complainant is a public official,in her private life she is entitled to enjoyment of the rights of an ordinary citizen.  Her privacy interest in the present appealis her right to be free from unwanted physical intrusion into the privacy of her home. The desire of a person to be free from unwantedphysical access by others has been usefully contrasted with a separate but overlapping category of privacy which is concerned withthe desire to be free from unwanted access to private information.  The former aspect of the right to privacy is recognised in art17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â¦</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">[124] Both aspects of privacy have also been recognized by the Courts.

Instead, a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls, which the State may legislateto protect, is an ability to avoid intrusions.

In <i>Brooker v Police</i>, like the US cases concerning picketing of residences and dwellings which McGrath J cited, the (alleged) interference with privacytook place outside the boundary of the victimâs house.

While he no doubt was andstill is a high-ranking public official, many if not all of his neighbours who lived in the same development at the time, and whowere affected by the intrusion of the petitioners into the development, were not.  Their rights, like the right of Mr Suen, werealso at stake.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  But even more importantly, for the purposes of the present debate, this argument regarding what constitutes a âhomeâ is quiteirrelevant because apart from article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, we also have article 29 of the Basic Law which specificallygoes beyond âhomesâ.  Article 29 specifically states that âthe homes and <i>other premises</i> of Hong Kong residents shall be inviolableâ.  It prohibits âarbitrary or unlawful search of, or intrusion into, a residentâshome or <i>other premises</i>â.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In other words, even if (for the sake of argument only) common areas such as a driveway do not form part of oneâs âhomeâ ina multi-ownership situation, they are nonetheless âother premisesâ, which like oneâs âhomeâ, attract the protection ofarticle 29 of the Basic Law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">3.8 Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I would respectfully borrow the words of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Appleby</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para 47, to conclude this part of my judgment.   In my view, in Hong Kong, notwithstanding the acknowledged importance of theright of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression, neither the provisions in the Basic Law nor those in the HongKong Bill of Rights bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of those rights.  None of the relevant provisions require the automaticcreation of rights of entry to private residential property. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In other words, the right of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression stop, so far as physical or geographical limitsare concerned, at the boundary of private residential property belonging to others, in the absence of any permission to enter.  (Thisis said, it should be noted, without prejudice to any possible argument that in situations such as that found in <i>Brooker v Police</i>, even activities carried out outside the physical boundary, but within the immediate proximity, of private residential premises could,depending on the facts, amount to an unlawful interference with the constitutional right to privacy at home of the owner or occupierof the premises.) </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In the present type of situation, there is no question of the restriction on the relevant rights not being prescribed by law orbeing uncertain.  The restriction is well defined by property law as well as the law of trespass.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In my view, the Magistrate has, with admirable clarity, come to the right legal conclusion in this regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">4    Implied permission for the petitioners to enter or remain? â ground 1(g) &amp; (h)</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  However, as <i>Nowak, op cit</i>, at p 494, points out, article 21 of the ICCPR protects assemblies on private property or in private buildings to the same extentas on public streets, square or in public assembly rooms; however, the prior approval of the owner is necessary for all propertyand buildings not freely accessible to the public.  This raises the question of whether the petitioners in our case had the permissionof the owners, residents or management of Shuk Yuen Building to enter or remain in the residential development to present the petitionto Mr Suen or to stage any demonstration.  This is essentially a question of fact.  In relation to it, the Magistrate made clearfindings that the petitioners were all trespassers to the development.  He gave the following reasons for his findings:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â19.   It is a fact undisputed in the present case that the demonstrators and petitioners in question were only able to assemble,display banners and chant slogans outside the metal gate of Shuk Yuen Building at the beginning since the metal gate was all thetime<i> </i>closed.  The metal gate was opened as a residentâs vehicle returned to the housing estate.  The crowd took the opportunity and enteredthe estate.  I have already stated clearly in the reasons for decision of the application of the defence for no case to answer thatthe authorization of the owners, residents or housekeepers concerned must be obtained before any outsiders can enter a private housingestate to hold certain activities.  However, it is obvious that the demonstrators and petitioners in question did not even have theauthorization to enter Shuk Yuen Building, even less the authorization to assemble and demonstrate in the housing estate.  The reasoningis simple enough.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">20.    The caretaker (DW1 Mr Chan Yuk-cheong (é³æ­æ)) who was on duty at the estate in question at the material time clearly statedunder cross-examination by Mr Pun that he did not anticipate the demonstrators and petitioners outside the metal gate would takethe opportunity of the opening of the gate to enter the estate.  However, he was helpless and at his witsâ end as the crowd hadalready entered.  Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Chan stated that he did not want to open the gate at the beginning. But the police asked him to open the gate to let the vehicle drive in.  He also stated that as police were already there, his mindwas at ease to let the police deal with the situation then.  He would have called the police for assistance if there had been nopolice.  During the examination-in-chief, Mr Chan said that he had told âLong Hairâ (i.e. the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant) that they could not enter as the said place was a private place.  However, âLong Hairâ asked him not to concern himselfin his own salary only, but also in the interest of the people at large.  After this conversation, Mr Chan felt that he was helplessand went back to the caretaker booth and stationed there.  During cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Chan explained that apartfrom âLong Hairâ, he did not know any of the demonstrators or petitioners at the scene.  He requested âLong Hairâ to leavebecause he appeared to be the leader and he hoped that âLong Hairâ would lead the others away.  Obviously, Mr Chan, the caretaker,was unwilling to let the crowd enter the housing estate and had expressed his wish to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">21.    As to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, the disc, exhibit D1, recorded that he had said the following to the crowd through the loudhailer before 12:50:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left"><i>(i)    The Incorporated Owners said that we were noisy!</i></p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left"><i>(ii)   The lady just now said that we caused obstruction here.</i></p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">Besides, the video tape, exhibit P1, also recorded that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant said the following to the crowd through the loudhailer:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">12:46 <i>The police talked to the caretaker ... what did the caretaker say, he told us to leave and</i> ... <i>Heâs just a caretaker.  We need not care what the caretaker said!</i> ... <i>The caretaker called the police, called once more<a>[3]</a>.</i></p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">I firmly believe that through the open speaking of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, there was no reason for the demonstrators and petitioners present at the scene not knowing that at the least, the incorporatedowners of the estate and a female resident were resentful of their demonstration and petition activities within the area of ShukYuen Building.  And Mr Chan, the caretaker, had also requested them to leave.  In fact, the crowd themselves knew it most clearlythat by what means they had entered the estate.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">22.    Based on the reasons given above, I rule that all the demonstrators and petitioners in question (including the six defendants)were trespassers.  I also firmly believe that the demonstrators and petitioners in question clearly knew that they took advantageof the gap between the opening and closing of the gate and seized the opportunity to enter the estate.  Their entry in fact had notbeen authorized.  Furthermore, the crowd certainly had not been authorized to hold the activities of demonstration and petition inthe estate. â¦â (Court translation)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  At the hearing of the appeal, the Court was referred to various parts of the transcript as well as the video and DVD recordings,with a view to challenging or upholding the Magistrateâs findings of fact.  Having considered the evidence, I am of the view thatthere was sufficient evidence to enable the Magistrate to come to his findings.  I see no justification for interfering with thefindings. </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Before I leave this topic, I should mention an argument raised by the defendants which has a bearing on the present question aswell as the point that the Magistrate has wrongly refused their applications to call Mr Suen to testify at the trial.  The defendantsargue that there is no evidence regarding Mr Suenâs attitude towards the petitioners.  There is a lurking possibility or doubtthat he was willing to meet the petitioners and allow them in.  The prosecution has simply failed to prove that Mr Suen did not consentto the petitionersâ entering the development to make a petition to him.  On that basis, the finding of trespass should be disturbed. Alternatively, the defendants argue, Mr Suen may have been unaware of the presence of the petitioners and one could not say thathe would definitely have refused to meet the petitioners within the development.  The possibilities are endless, the defendants submit. The defendants also point out that a Sergeant Sze testified at trial that he had met with Mr Suen on the morning of the day in questionand had been told by Mr Suen that he did not want to meet the petitioners.  However, his evidence was contradicted by the CCTV recordingat the entrance to Mr Suenâs block and even the prosecution asked the Magistrate not to believe Sergeant Szeâs evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The defendantsâ argument must be rejected.  If Mr Suen was unaware of the presence of the petitioners, there could be no questionof his giving any permission for the petitioners to enter the development.  As for the possibility that he had actually given permissionfor the petitionersto enter and to meet him within the development, I believe this is a fanciful possibility that flies in the faceof the entire evidence.  In fact, the Magistrate made the same point in his reasons given for refusing one of the applications bythe defendants to call Mr Suen.  The reality is that the caretaker had been informed by the police at around 10 am of the expectedarrival of the petitioners.  According to the caretaker, he told the chauffeur of Mr Suen accordingly.  The petitioners arrived atthe development entrance at 11:40 am.  They entered the main gates at 12:05 pm and the charging of the police cordon took place at12:51 pm.  After breaking through the police cordon, the petitioners stayed at the ground floor entrance to Blocks C and D until1:25 pm when they left, after inserting a petition letter into Mr Suenâs letter box located at the ground floor of the building. Throughout, Mr Suen did not meet with the petitioners either personally or through any representative.  He only left Shuk Yuen Buildingby car in the afternoon after the petitioners were all gone.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In those circumstances, it is simply unrealistic to suggest that it was Mr Suenâs intention to permit the petitioners to comein and to accept their petition letter either personally or through a representative.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Counsel for the defendants have cited to the Court various cases to illustrate that permission to enter could be implied.  I haveno difficulty with the proposition so far as it goes.  But everything depends on the facts, and the cases cited by counsel all turnon their own facts.  For instance, in <i>Faulkner v Willetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20RTR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] RTR 159</a>, which was heavily relied on by counsel, a constable went to the house of a person, wishing to interview him in connection with aroad accident in which a car driven by him had been involved.  The constable identified himself to the personâs wife and informedher of the reason for his visit.  She opened the door fully, walked back into the house, giving the constable the impression thatit was an implied invitation to follow her into the house, which he did.  No oral permission was given by the personâs wife forthe constable to enter the house, and at no time was an indication, oral or otherwise, given refusing him entry.  Inside the house,the constable identified himself to the person and explained that he wished to interview him.  The person took no steps to requestthe constable to leave but offered him refreshment.  On those facts, the Court of Appeal took the view that the Magistratesâ Courtwas quite entitled to come to the conclusion that there was an invitation to enter by conduct, and refused to interfere with thefinding.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The case is wholly distinguishable from the present case.  Here, prior to the arrival of the residentâs car, the main gates wereclosed for the entire 25 minutes since the arrival of the petitioners at the entrance.  The gates were only opened to allow the residentâscar in.  The petitioners seized upon the opportunity to enter the development.  In those circumstances, one could hardly say thatthere was an invitation to enter by conduct.  The caretakerâs inaction in not stopping the petitioners from entering or in notasking them to leave was, in the circumstances of the case, entirely understandable and could not have misled the petitioners.  Forby then, the police had, as the caretakerâs evidence shows, taken over the situation from the caretaker. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In any event, from the caretakerâs conversation with the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, which the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant mentioned to all those who were present, it is plain that no permission was given to the petitioners to enter or remainin the development, let alone to go beyond the police cordon then formed on the private driveway.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In the circumstances, there is no question of the petitioners, in particular, the defendants, being under any mistaken belief thatthey were permitted by the owners, residents or management to enter the residential development, or put at the lowest, to go beyondthe police cordon.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The defendants point out from the evidence that the same concern group had been into Shuk Yuen Building three years ago to âvisitâMr Suen during Chinese New Year.  On that occasion, they were not stopped by anybody and in fact, according to some newspaper reports,a government spokesman was reported as saying that there was no question of those present causing a nuisance to anybody because theywere exercising their constitutional rights there.  The defendants argue that they therefore had or thought that they had the impliedpermission to enter the development again.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  I reject the argument.  On the facts, and particularly, on the evidence of the caretaker, it is plain that no permission, expressor implied, was given by anybody for the petitioners to enter the development on this occasion.  The previous occasion was so farremoved from the present one that it had no relevance at all.  The caretaker had not even been employed to work at the developmentthen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">5    Were the police officers trespassers and were they executing their duty inside the development â ground 1(f)?</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I now consider the position of the police officers who formed a human chain to prevent the petitioners from going further down thedriveway to approach the building where Mr Suen resided. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The petitioners, as mentioned, eventually charged the cordon<a>[4]</a>.  According to the Magistrate, by doing so, they turned their assembly into an unlawful one for the purposes of section 18 of thePublic Order Ordinance, and the six defendants were therefore charged with and convicted of taking part in an unlawful assembly.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  It is the contention of the defendants that not only were they not trespassers at the time, but the police officers were themselvestrespassers at the scene.  They were not acting in the execution of their duty when they tried to prevent the petitioners from movingforward.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I have already come to the conclusion that the Magistrate was right in finding that the petitioners were trespassers.  I rejectthe defendantsâ argument that the police officers were trespassers.  Judging from the evidence available, and in particular theevidence of the caretaker, the police officers were obviously at the scene (within the residential development) with the permissionof the caretaker.  In this regard, as mentioned, permission need not be oral, and can be implied from conduct.  On the evidence ofthe caretaker, it is plain that the police officers were permitted impliedly by the caretaker to enter the residential developmentin order to control the petitioners.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The defendants argue that even if the police officers were not trespassers, they had no business to be inside the private premisesof citizens.  In those circumstances, they were not acting in the execution of their duty when they formed the cordon and preventedthe petitioners from moving down the driveway.  The defendants refer to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232">Cap 232</a>) which sets out the duties of the police force, and argue that the police officersâ action on private land on the dayin question did not fall within any of the provisions set out in the section.  The defendants remind the Court that unlike the presentposition in the United Kingdom (see the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994), in Hong Kong trespassing is not a crime butremains a civil wrong only, in relation to which the police, the defendants argue, has no role to play. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I reject the argument.  First, as Ms Anna Lai for the prosecution correctly pointed out, a police officerâs duty is to be a keeperof the peace and to take all necessary steps with that in view.  If invited by the landowner, the police can enter private premisesto keep the peace, prevent crime or protect property from criminal injury.  <i>Coffin v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2071%20Cr%20App%20R%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 71 Cr App R 221</a>; <i>Lewis v Prosser</i>, unreported, Queenâs Bench Divisional Court (Watkins LJ &amp; Nolan J), CO/1150/83, 30 October 1984; <i>Lamb v Director of Public Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20154%20JP%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 154 JP 381.</a>  In particular, depending on the facts, even though whilst at the premises the police officers were satisfied that there was no breachor suspected breach of the peace, and that there was nothing in the suspected troublemakersâ conduct which gave cause for concern,the police officers could stay behind at the premises and take all necessary steps to ensure that the suspected troublemakers peacefullyleft the premises (<i>Lewis v</i> <i>Prosser</i>).</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  On the facts of the present case, the police officers were entitled to take the view that there could be a breach of the peace bythe petitioners after their entry into the private property in the manner they did.  There was evidence (PW3) to the effect thatthe police was apprehensive of the situation turning volatile, particularly if Mr Suen were to refuse to see the petitioners, andit was mindful of the safety of the people there, including elderly people and children. </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Moreover, just like the positive duty of the government (including the police) to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enablelawful demonstration to take place peacefully (<i>Leung Kwok Hung v HKSAR</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282005%29%208%20HKCFAR%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) 8 HKCFAR 229)</a>, articles 6, 29 and 105 of the Basic Law and article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights would, in my view, require the government(including the police) to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Hong Kong residentsâ homes and other premises againstintrusion and their privacy at home against interference, provided that the measures, if they are to be taken within private premises,must be taken with the permission of their owner or occupier.  It would be a very strange result if all the police is entitled todo is to prevent demonstrators from entering private premises whilst they are still in a public place; but once the demonstratorshave managed to intrude into private premises without the consent of their owner, the police can do nothing to restrain the demonstratorseven though it is permitted to enter or is indeed asked to enter to repel or restrain the unwelcome demonstrators.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  For those reasons, I am clearly of the view that the police officers were executing their duty when they formed the human chainto prevent the petitioners from moving down the driveway.  In those circumstances, when the defendants used force to charge the policecordon, they plainly behaved in a disorderly manner likely to cause any person reasonably to fear that they would commit a breachof the peace.  Indeed, their action amounted to a breach of the peace â see the definition of the term in <i>R v Howell (Errol)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20QB%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] QB 416</a>, 427E-F, quoted with approval by the House of Lords in <i>R (Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Constabulary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%202%20AC%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 2 AC 105</a>, para 27:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âWe are emboldened to say that there is a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a personor in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault, an affray, a riot, unlawful assemblyor other disturbance.  It is for this breach of the peace when done in his presence or the reasonable apprehension of it taking placethat a constable, or anyone else, may arrest an offender without warrant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">6    Positive duty and wrongful interference â ground 1(b) &amp; (i)</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Then it is said by the defendants that the police officers were acting in breach of their positive duty to take reasonable and appropriatemeasures to enable their lawful assembly to take place.  Rather, the police officers were guilty of unlawfully interfering with theirassembly and demonstration.  It is argued that the police failed to contact on behalf of the petitioners Mr Suen to see whether hewould receive the petitioners.  Rather, the police wrongfully interfered with their assembly by misleading the petitioners regardingthe true attitude of Mr Suen.  In particular, they rely on what the police officers told them at the scene (namely, that the policewas contacting Mr Suen for his response) and the contradictory evidence given by Sergeant Sze in Court that in fact he had been toldby Mr Suen earlier on that he would not be meeting the petitioners.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Indeed the defendants argue that the police had no justification at all to form the cordon on the driveway as there was no reasonableapprehension of an imminent breach of the peace: see <i>Laporte, supra.</i>  The police was simply not justified to interfere with the petitionersâ exercise of their right of assembly and right to freedomof expression.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In my view, these arguments fall by the wayside once it is concluded, as the Court has concluded, that the petitioners had no rightto hold any assembly within the private residential development in the absence of permission.  It must be remembered that the positiveduty on the part of the government and police that the Court of Final Appeal spoke about in <i>Leung Kwok Hung</i> is a positive duty âto take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable <i>lawful</i> assemblies to take place peacefullyâ (my emphasis) (para 22).  As the petitioners had no right to assemble within the private residentialdevelopment without the necessary permission, there is no question of the police owing to them any positive duty to assist them tohold the assembly.  Nor is there any question of the police interfering with the petitionersâ right to assembly, which was notexercisable within the private residential development in the absence of the necessary permission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">7    Actus rea and mens rea â ground 3</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Both Mr Poon and Miss Leung argue that there was insufficient evidence to prove that their clients voluntarily took part in chargingthe police cordon.  They said that on the video evidence in particular, there were doubts as to whether their clients were simplypushed by others against the police line.  Similar arguments are raised regarding their <i>mens rea</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Having watched the police video tape (exhibit P1), I have no doubt that the Magistrate has made the correct findings against thedefendants.  I regard the suggestion that they were merely pushed forward by others involuntarily against the police line as whollyfanciful.  It is plain from the circumstances that they were voluntary participants in charging the police cordon.  What action ormethod they actually used to break through the cordon does not matter at all.  Whether they used their arms and hands, the frontparts of their bodies or their backs to push against the police line is neither here nor there.  Nor would it make any differenceif they were merely standing passively there in front of the police line, relying on others in the same group to push them againstthe line.  The crucial question is whether they were behaving in a âdisorderly mannerâ which would likely to cause any personreasonably to fear that they would commit a breach of the peace.  I have already alluded to the definition of a breach of the peace. In fact, several policemen were injured in the whole incident.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The actions of the various defendants can be seen from the police video tape, even when viewed at normal speed.  I need not dealwith the criticism made against the Magistrate that he has on his own watched the video tape in slow motion in order to identifythe defendants and determine what they were doing at the time when the police cordon was charged.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As regards the defendantsâ <i>mens rea</i>, I cannot do better than quote from the statement of findings:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIn my view, the crowd who had taken part in the rush on the police line at the material time had the intention to take part inthe said âunlawful assemblyâ and to conduct themselves in a disorderly manner.  Even though there were no comparatively clearervideo recordings to show that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants had on their own initiative pushed and bumped against the police officers forming the line of defence, they had not takenany definite action to pull themselves out of the crowd either (like the old people and children sitting on one side).  Therefore,the only reasonable inference is that they also had the intention to take part in conducting themselves in a disorderly manner (iebreaking through the police line).  In fact, every one who had taken part in the said âunlawful assemblyâ had the chance to pulloneself definitely out of the crowd, who were confronting the police, before the crowdâs rush on the police line.  If he/she hadnot done so, his/her choice testified fair and square to his/her intention.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Charging a police cordon lawfully formed to prevent people from moving beyond it is disorderly conduct.</p>    <p class="heading">8    âSelf-helpâ â ground 2</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  It is suggested that when charging the police cordon the defendants only used reasonable force.  In this regard, Miss Leung relieson <i>McBean v Parker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20147%20JP%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 147 JP 205</a>, 207-208.  This âself-helpâ argument would only be relevant if the defendants were then lawfully exercising their right of assemblyand the right to freedom of expression, and the police cordon was an unlawful interference with their exercise of those rights. However, as explained, this was not the case, and the argument of self-help simply has no place in this case.</p>    <p class="heading">9    Refusals to summons Mr Suen â ground 4</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Finally, the Magistrate is criticised for refusing the defendantsâ repeated applications to summons Mr Suen to give evidence atthe trial.  I accept Ms Laiâs argument that a magistrate may refuse to issue a witness summons unless he is satisfied that theevidence which the intended witness is apparently able to give is material to the issues in question and can be said to tend to supportthe case of the party seeking to call the witness: <i>R v Marylebone Magistratesâ Court, ex parte Gatting and Emburey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20154%20JP%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 154 JP 549</a>; <i>R v Baines</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1909%5d%201%20KB%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1909] 1 KB 258.</a></p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  It is suggested that Mr Suenâs evidence would have been relevant to whether he had actually permitted the petitioners to enterthe development and whether he had been prepared to meet them personally or by representative; whether he had told the police thathe was not going to see the petitioners (as per Sergeant Szeâs evidence); whether the police had otherwise contacted him for hisresponse towards the petitionersâ requests; and various miscellaneous matters.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  As discussed above, on the evidence of the present case, it is a fanciful possibility that Mr Suen was prepared to allow the petitionersin so that he could meet them either personally or through a representative.  Coupled with the finding that the petitioners wereactually trespassers and had no right to assemble within the residential development, the other matters on which Mr Suen is saidto have been able to give material evidence were simply irrelevant to the issues that the Magistrate had to decide, for the reasonsset out above.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In the circumstances, the complaint against the Magistrateâs refusals to issue a witness summons to Mr Suen is wholly misplaced.</p>    <p class="heading">10  Outcome</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  For all these reasons, the appeals are dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Andrew Cheung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Hectar Pun and Miss Katherine Chan, instructed by Ho, Tse, Wai &amp; Partners, for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> appellants</p>        <p>Miss Annie Leung, instructed by Rowdget W Young &amp; Co, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th </sup>appellants</p>        <p>Mr Leung Kwok Hung, the 4<sup>th</sup> appellant, appearing in person</p>        <p>Ms Anna Lai, SPP and Mr Derek Lai, SPP, of the Department of Justice, for the respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <hr style="text-align:left" width="33%" />    <p class="quote"><a>[1]</a>  After the hearing of the appeals, the Court drew the partiesâ attention to <i>Pruneyard</i> and <i>Golden Gateway Center</i> and invited them to make further submissions on the two cases.</p>    <p class="quote"><a>[2]</a>  This is an example mentioned by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in argument.
