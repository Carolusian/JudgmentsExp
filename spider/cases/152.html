This has always been disputed by D (see Statement of Claim para.2 atAgreed Bundle p.1; Defence and Counterclaim para.5(4) at Agreed Bundle p.12; and Reply and Defence to Counterclaim para.4(6) at AgreedBundle p.54).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On the first day of trial, Ms. Wong (counsel for P) informed the court that P would no longer take issue with the fact that the employmentrelationship between P and D had not been terminated in July 2002.  Leave was granted to P to amend her pleadings accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> As a result of the above concession made by P, it is now common ground that D had been employed by P as a coach driver up to itstermination in September 2002 (see Amended Statement of Claim para.2 at Agreed Bundle p.604).  How their employment relationshipended, however, is a matter in great dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>Overview of the respective case of the parties</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It is Pâs case that Dâs employment was terminated on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002 by mutual agreement.  However, D failed and refused to inform P the whereabouts of the coach then assigned to himbearing the registration no. KJ 4376 (âthe Coachâ) despite requests and demands after the date of termination (see Amended Statementof Claim para.7(1) at Agreed Bundle p.606).  In addition, D has also failed and refused to return to P the wireless transceiver installedon board the Coach (âthe Transceiverâ), the cover of the coolant reservoir, the cover of the lubricant chamber and the smallengine cover of the Coach (âthe 3 Coversâ), as well as boarding tickets/coupons that D had collected from passengers (see AmendedStatement of Claim para.7(3)-(4) at Agreed Bundle p.606).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> By reason of the aforesaid, says P, D has breached the employment contract and committed the tort of conversion and P has sufferedloss and damage as a result (see Amended Statement of Claim para.8-9 at Agreed Bundle pp.607-608).  Initially, P prayed for bothan order for delivery up of the Transceiver and damages.  However, it has now become clear that the damages claimed by P includesthe cost of replacement of the Transceiver.  In the end, P only asks for damages in the total sum of $124,570.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> D denies that his employment was terminated on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002 as alleged by P.  Instead, D says he was constructively dismissed on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 when P withdrew the Coach and demanded the return of the keys to the Coach from him (see Defence and Counterclaimpara.5(5) and 12 at Agreed Bundle pp.12-13 and 19-31).  D is counterclaiming against P in the total sum of $23,677.70 being wagesin lieu of notice, annual leave pay and end of year payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> D denies that he has breached the employment contract or committed conversion.  It is Dâs case that all along P knew where theCoach was parked.  He denies having taken the Transceiver.  He maintains that he had removed the 3 Covers from the Coach as a securitymeasure to prevent the Coach from being stolen, which were handed to the police for P on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>Background</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Despite the vast difference between the parties, there is much common ground in the evidence.  Mr. Iu (solicitor for D) has helpfullysummarized those facts which are not in dispute in his written closing submission.  They have been subjected to remarks made by Ms.Wong in her written reply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> For the purpose of this judgment, I have accepted the following facts to be common ground between the parties.  These facts providethe backbone for the ensuring discussion and their relevance will become apparent when one turns to the specific issues in dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> P is the sole-proprietress of Long Fai Bus Company (âLong Faiâ) and holds the title of deputy general manager of the company. Mr. Man Tat Shing (âMANâ) is the general manager of Long Fai whereas Mr. Li Kwok Wing (âLIâ) is Long Faiâs supervisorof coaches.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Long Fai Bus Limited (âLF Limitedâ) was incorporated on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2002.  MAN holds 99.99 % of the shareholding in LF Limited and P holds the remaining 0.01 % shareholding.  MAN and P are theonly directors of LF Limited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Avonwin Holdings Tour Limited (âAvonwinâ) was incorporated on 26<sup>th</sup> June 2002.  MAN holds 98 % of the shareholding in Avonwin and P holds the remaining 2 % shareholding.  There are 4 directors of Avonwinincluding MAN and P.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Long Fai, LF Limited and Avonwin share the same address as their offices.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Dâs employment contract was negotiated and agreed upon by MAN (for and on behalf of P or Long Fai) and D in November 2001.  P commencedworking for Long Fai as a coach driver on 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In early January 2002, P purchased the Coach, which was then brand new, at $300,000 to $400,000.  The Coach has a seating capacityof 30 (including driver).   The Transceiver was installed on board the Coach for use by the driver for communication purposes.  TheTransceiver had a detachable front panel cover (âthe Panelâ).  No anti-theft security measure was installed on the Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Soon after its purchase, the Coach was assigned to be driven exclusively by D.  D was given one set of keys to the Coach and a spareset was kept by Long Fai.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Generally, Long Faiâs coaches are parked at its designated car park in Hang Mei (åå°¾) in Tin Shui Wai.  Shortly after the Coachwas assigned to D, D obtained permission from P through MAN to park the Coach in the vicinity of Dâs residence in Sung Ching SanTsuen (å´æ­£æ°æ) in Yuen Long.  At all material times, P (and MAN) knew where D resided.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> What happened between 6<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 is hotly contested.

Curiously, Ms. Wong submits in her writtenreply that there was no bailment and that <i>Gilchrist Watt &amp; Sanderson Pty Ltd v. York Products Pty Ltd</i> is not applicable but without giving any reason.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> If, according to Mr. Iu, D was obligated to take due care of the Coach, D must be taken to be under an obligation not to intentionallycause damage to the Coach.  It therefore seems to me that both parties are in fact in agreement that at least D was under an obligationnot to intentionally cause damage to the Coach.  Whether such obligation flows from the employment contract (as alleged by P) orfrom the law of bailment (as alleged by D) is perhaps academic in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> As to the second limb of the alleged implied term, it is clear from MANâs testimony that Long Fai had not given instructions toits drivers that they had first to obtain Long Faiâs authorization or consent before they could remove anything from the coachesassigned to them.  In any event, P has adduced no evidence as to why this limb should be implied into the employment contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In the premises, I only find that it was an implied term of the employment contract that D was under an obligation not to intentionallycause damage to the Coach. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> As to whether D should be entitled to end of year payment under the employment contract, the matter is much more complicated andwill be discussed later in this judgment when I consider Dâs counterclaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Lastly, it must be noted that parties are also in disagreement on pleading as to the term of the employment contract entitling Dto any âorder feeâ for additional work not covered by his basic salary (see paragraphs 5(3)(f)-(g) of Defence and Counterclaimat Agreed Bundle 11-12; and paragraph 4(4)-(5) of the Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim at Agreed Bundle pp.612-613).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Since Dâs claim for âorder feeâ has apparently been dealt with by the Labour Tribunal in the Award dated 9<sup>th</sup> January 2003 and D is not claiming for any âorder feeâ in his counterclaim herein, it is not necessary for me to resolve thisdispute and I shall say no more.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>How was the employment contract terminated?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The main dispute in this case is how the employment relationship between P and D ended.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> To recap, it is Pâs case that Dâs employment contract was terminated by mutual agreement on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002.

The relevant conversation was between P and D in person.  MAN was not present at the meetings.  Although LI was presentat both meetings and YUEN had attended the afternoon one, the discussion between P and each employee was apparently held individuallyat a separate table and so they do not know what was said between P and D.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> According to P:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>				<td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">She met with D and other employees of Long Fai in the morning of 6<sup>th</sup> September 2002 for the purpose of making arrangement to transfer the business of Long Fai to LF Limited.

On 28<sup>th</sup> November 2002, MAN has told the Labour Tribunal that after he had learnt from P that D had refused on 6<sup>th</sup> September to change his working status, he instructed P on 7<sup>th</sup> September 2002 to tell D that Dâs employment would be terminated on 15<sup>th</sup> September and D needed not report to work on 16<sup>th</sup> September (see transcript at 26H-I, T-V and 27O-175G at Agreed Bundle pp.173-174).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> In my view, Pâs testimony is inconsistent with MANâs testimony at the Tribunal in 2 material aspects.  First, Man said he onlygave instructions to P to terminate Dâs employment on 7<sup>th</sup> September.  So, P could not have given oral notice to D on 6<sup>th</sup> September.  Secondly, Manâs understanding of the effect of the notice is to terminate Dâs employment with effect from 16<sup>th</sup> September.  This, again, is different from Pâs case that Dâs employment was terminated on 14<sup>th</sup> September.  When Man is cross-examined on the above inconsistencies, he simply says that P might not have followed his instructionsand that he does not know what P has in fact told D on 6<sup>th</sup> September.  Given MANâs role in Long Fai as general manager and Pâs admission that she relied on MAN for Long Faiâs administrativematters, the above inconsistencies are remarkable and Manâs excuses unsatisfactory.  Furthermore, if P had already given noticeof termination to D, it would not be necessary for MAN to instruct P to do that again!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Secondly, according to Pâs pleaded case either party might terminate Dâs employment by giving 1-month advance notice.  So, ifP had given notice to terminate Dâs employment on 6<sup>th</sup> September, such termination should take effect on 5<sup>th</sup> October â i.e. 1 month from 6<sup>th</sup> September!  However, it is Pâs testimony that the termination would take effect on 14<sup>th</sup> September.  How could this possible?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> P tries very hard to explain away in cross-examination by alleging that prior to 6<sup>th</sup> September the parties had reached another agreement to amend the notice period from 1 month to 7 days.  When she was pressed hardon the timing of this alleged prior agreement, she first said that the agreement was made in early September 2002.  Later on, shealleged that it was made in the month of July 2002.  In any event, the alleged prior agreement, whether in early September or inJuly, has never been pleaded. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Thirdly, if P is correct that Dâs employment ended on 14<sup>th</sup> September and that she had asked D to return to calculate the outstanding wages, one would expect P to be prepared to calculate Dâsoutstanding wages on 14<sup>th</sup> September.  It is noted that, in the past, D had received his basic salary of $12,000 by cheques or cash (see Agreed Bundle at pp.263-273). However, it is clear from Pâs testimony that she was not in a position to do so on that day.  She was admittedly not ready tocalculate Dâs outstanding wages and did not bring any cash or cheques for payment to D.  This leads one to doubt if P had reallymeant to terminate Dâs employment and calculate Dâs outstanding wages on 14<sup>th</sup> September.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Other than the above obvious discrepancies, I have also causes to doubt the genuineness of Pâs case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> On pleadings, P has always denied that there was a second meeting on 6<sup>th</sup> September (see Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim para.7(5) at Agreed Bundle p.616; and Defence and Counterclaim para.12(5)-(6)at Agreed Bundle p.21).  The implication, insofar as Pâs pleaded case is concerned, must be that the oral notice to terminate Dâsemployment was given in the morning meeting (see Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim para.7(1) at Agreed Bundle p.615; Defenceand Counterclaim para.12(1) at Agreed Bundle p.19).  Yet, P admits during cross-examination that there was a second meeting on 6<sup>th</sup> September and further alleges in re-examination that the alleged oral notice was given in the afternoon meeting.  So, Pâs testimonyin court is not consistent with her pleadings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Again on pleadings, P has always alleged that she had only showed D one document on 6<sup>th</sup> September (see Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim para.7(3) at Agreed Bundle p.616; Defence and Counterclaim para.12(3)at Agreed Bundle p.20).  Pâs former solicitors have even supplied a copy of this alleged single document to Dâs solicitors uponthe latterâs request (see Agreed Bundle pp.281-283).  However, it is quite apparent from Pâs testimony that the document suppliedby Pâs former solicitors is none of the 2 documents mentioned in her testimony.  The document supplied by Pâs former solicitorsis concerned with the period between 4<sup>th</sup> July 2002 and 3<sup>rd</sup> July 2003 (see Agreed Bundle p.283).  However, according to Pâs testimony in court, the 2 documents put to D should relate to theperiods of 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2001 to 2<sup>nd</sup> December 2002 and 3<sup>rd</sup> December 2002 and 2<sup>nd</sup> December 2003 respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Pâs case that D had demanded for $29,000 on 14<sup>th</sup> September is also suspicious.  The amount allegedly demanded by D (i.e. $29,000) matches the amount of Dâs claim in the LabourTribunal (i.e. $29,497.70, see Agreed Bundle p.144) closely.  According to D, he was only advised by the Labour Department on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2002 that his claim against P would be in the region of $29,000 odd and so he could not have made such demand on 14<sup>th</sup> September.  Curiously, when D was interviewed by the police under caution on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002, no question was put to him about this alleged demand of $29,000 (see Agreed Bundle pp.289-292)!  This subject wasonly brought up during the interview on 1<sup>st</sup> November 2002 (see question and answer no. 8 in Dâs cautioned statement at Agreed Bundle p.322).  If D had really demanded for$29,000 on 14<sup>th</sup> September, would MAN have failed to mention it to the police when he reported the matter?  Dâs solicitors have consistently requestedfor a copy of MANâs statement to the police to confirm what had been said by MAN to the police but to no avail (see Dâs solicitorsâletters at Agreed Bundle pp.542, 545, 548, 550, 555 and 558).  P has never disclosed MANâs statement to the police to D or at trial. When MAN is cross-examined, he initially said he did not recall whether he had mentioned Dâs demand of $29,000 when he made hisinitial report to the police.  Upon further cross-examination by Mr. Iu, MAN then admits that he probably have only told the policewell after 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 about the demand when he was requested by the police to give a further statement.  In my view, MANâs testimony notonly casts doubt on Pâs testimony but supports Dâs testimony that no demand for $29,000 was made on 14<sup>th</sup> September.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Turning to Dâs case that there had not been any notice to terminate his employment, his case tends to be supported by the followingevidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>				<td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The content of his cautioned statement given at 1835 hours on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 (see Agreed Bundle pp.289-291) is consistent with Dâs defence.

In the end, P said she would speak to MAN again and asked D to re-consider his stance and gave her an answer by 14<sup>th</sup> September.  She further warned D that if he should refuse to sign the documents, he would be fired.  D then asked P to confirm ifP had decided to fire him but there was no answer from P.  Curiously, P agrees under cross-examination that she has indeed told Din the afternoon meeting that D would have to resign if he still refused to sign the documents by 14<sup>th</sup> September.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>				<td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">According to D, he called in sick in the morning on 16<sup>th</sup> September and requested for half-day sick leave.  MAN confirms that he has received such call from D.  If Dâs employment had alreadybeen terminated on 14<sup>th</sup> September, why would D need to ask for sick leave from MAN?  What is even more surprising is MANâs response over the same call. He testifies in court that he had scolded D for not calling earlier and in any event it was not necessary for D to call as D hadalready been fired.  This is inconsistent with his evidence at the Labour Tribunal.  Manâs alleged scolding of D does not featurein his testimony in the Labour Tribunal on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2002.  Instead, Man is reported to have told the Labour Tribunal that his reply to D was simply, âAlright, canât helpitâ (âå¥½åï¼åè¾¦æ³åâ) (see transcript at 31P at Agreed Bundle p.178).</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> According to D, there was another meeting between MAN and D in the evening of 6<sup>th</sup> September 2002.  At the conclusion of the meeting, D told MAN that P should follow the employment law if P wished to fire him.  MANasked D to continue with his work.  Ms. Wong criticizes D in her written closing submission for not mentioning this meeting in Dâswitness statement filed herein.  However, D has apparently mentioned such a meeting when he testified on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2002 at the Labour Tribunal (see transcript at 4A-E at Agreed Bundle p.151).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Ms. Wong, in her written closing submission, submits that the fact that P had indicated to D on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2002 that the employment relationship would terminate on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002 and they would do the calculation on that day is reflected in Dâs witness statement to the Labour Tribunal at AgreedBundle p.523.  However, I cannot discern such an indication in Dâs said witness statement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> In her written closing submission, Ms. Wong on the one hand criticizes D for going to the Labour Department (as opposed to the policeor contacting P) on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 when he found the Coach missing.  On the other hand, D was also criticized for going to P after his enquiry with theLabour Department.  I find these criticisms unjustified.  According to D, he immediately called MAN to enquire if MAN had repossessedthe Coach when he discovered the Coach missing.  MAN did not give him a direct answer (âæ¯å¾ä»¥å°â), which gave him the impressionthat P wanted to fire him.  That, together with the fact that he had been asked to sign the 2 documents on 6<sup>th</sup> September, prompted him to seek advise from the Labour Department.  I find Dâs action in seeking advise from the Labour Departmentas opposed to contacting P or the police reasonable.  It is also Dâs evidence that he called P at about 4 pm after he had consultedthe Labour Department to enquire if she had taken the Coach.  I find nothing remarkable in D calling P at that stage.  D had earliercalled MAN and could not get a definite answer as to the whereabouts of the Coach.  He then went to the Labour Department and wasadvised to send letters to P to preserve his rights and to wait for 7 days.  I find it reasonable for him then to enquire with Pto clarify his position in relation to the Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Ms. Wong also submits that Dâs and YUENâs testimony are in complete contradiction insofar as the telephone conversation betweenthem on 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002 is concerned.  This is not supported by the evidence.  On the contrary, I find their evidence generally consistentwith each other.

Hence, she did not state in her statement filed with the Labour Tribunal thatthe Panel was also lost.  However, it is noted that she has also stated in the same statement that she had demanded D for the returnof the 3 Covers on 15<sup>th</sup> September.  If she had then considered the 3 Covers (which she knew were kept by D) lost, why did she not consider the Panel as lost? Pâs explanation is clearly untenable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> It has always been Dâs case that he has not taken the Transceiver or the Panel away.

However, I find Pâs case inthis respect far from satisfactory.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> It is Pâs case that without the Panel, the whole Transceiver would have to be replaced.  Pâs testimony is that she asked MANand LI to purchase a replacement transceiver for the Coach.  After the purchase, the new transceiver was installed in the Coach andshe was given the said invoice.  However, when it is pointed out to her during cross-examination that the said invoice is apparentlydated 10<sup>th</sup> December 2001 (i.e. long before 15<sup>th</sup> September 2002 when MAN allegedly discovered the Panel missing), she replies that the said invoice is only produced for referencepurpose. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> MANâs initial testimony in court is already quite different from that of P.  He says that the invoice at Agreed Bundle p.591 wasthe invoice for the Transceiver (i.e. the one that was lost).  He further alleged that the Transceiver was installed on the Coachabout 1-2 days after purchase.  However, when he is confronted with the fact that the said invoice (dated 10<sup>th</sup> December 2001) pre-dated the purchase of the Coach (i.e. January 2002, see the certificate of particulars of the Coach at AgreedBundle p.192), he simply agrees without offering any explanation!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> If P has indeed purchased a replacement transceiver, one would expect some documentary evidence such as invoice or receipt to evidencethe purchase.  This is all the more so as P should be very astute in retaining relevant evidence given the events that P said hadhappened in September 2002.  I consider it most unsatisfactory that P is unable to produce any documentary evidence.  Worse still,neither P nor MAN can offer any consistent and satisfactory account on the absence of an invoice/receipt.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> All in all, I find P has not discharged her burden of proving Item (1) of her claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(c) The Coach</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> It is Pâs case that D has unlawfully failed and/or refused to inform P the whereabouts of the Coach despite repeated requests anddemands after the date of termination of the employment contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> To succeed in this regard, P must establish that neither she nor MAN knew where the Coach was at the material time.  If they hadall along known where the Coach was parked, there could be no question of D failing or refusing to inform them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> It is common ground that Long Faiâs coaches are generally parked at its designated car park in Tin Shui Wai.  According to P, LongFaiâs coaches may not be parked anywhere else without first obtaining permission.  MAN is principally responsible to know the whereaboutsof Long Faiâs coaches and she does not need to know and it is enough to obtain MANâs permission to park somewhere else.  At thematerial time, although she knew the Coach was not parked at Long Faiâs designated car park, she did not know where D had parkedthe Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> MAN confirms that he had given permission to D to park the Coach in the vicinity of Dâs residence.  He, however, denies he hadbeen informed where exactly D was parking the Coach.  On 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002, he spent half an hour driving around the vicinity of Dâs residence but failed to locate the Coach.  On the nextday, he managed to find the Coach inside YYCP after another half-hour search.  He confirms that YYCP is within walking distance fromwhere D resided.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> It is Dâs testimony that he had obtained permission from MAN to park the Coach nearer his residence in order to save travelingtime.  He rented a car parking space at YYCP, which is within walking distance from his residence, and had been parking the Coachthere.  He has produced the receipts from YYCP evidencing the fact that he had been parking there (see Agreed Bundle at pp.275-276). He has informed MAN that he was parking the Coach at YYCP and MAN had even been to YYCP to inspect the location.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Both P and MAN deny knowledge that the Coach was parked at YYCP.  They both testify that they were in fact not concerned where theCoach was parked.  I find their laxity most surprising.  First, it is inconsistent with the strict policy of Long Fai to have allcoaches parked at the designated car park.  Secondly, it is common ground that Long Fai kept a set of spare keys to the Coach incase the Coach was urgently required.  What was the point in keeping the spare keys if no one in Long Fai (other than D) knew wherethe Coach was?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> On the other hand, the fact that the Coach was eventually âfoundâ inside YYCP is consistent with Dâs case that he did not failor refuse to inform P of the whereabouts of the Coach.  First, D had been permitted to park the Coach in the vicinity of his residenceand it is common ground that YYCP is within walking distance from Dâs residence.  Secondly, if he had wanted to keep P from knowingthe whereabouts of the Coach, would he have parked it at YYCP â something that he had been permitted to do?  Thirdly, Dâs witness,YUEN, also says that MAN had made it his business to know the whereabouts of YUENâs coach, which had also been permitted to parkaway from the designated car park.  This tends to confirm Dâs case that MAN should know the whereabouts of the Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> In her written closing submission, Ms. Wong criticizes D for referring to YYCP in 3 different ways.  In fact, D might only have referredto YYCP by 2 names at most, namely, âæ¦èåè»å ´â (see answer no.8 of Dâs cautioned statement at Agreed Bundle p.291) andâå®¹è¨åè»å ´â (see transcript at 12R at Agreed Bundle p.453).  The remaining description, namely, âåæå¤§æ£ è·¯æ¦èå£«å¤å°é¢åè»å ´âwas in fact used by a police officer (see Agreed Bundle p.321).  In any event, I find the 2 names used by D reasonably close to eachother.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In the premises, I do not accept that P did not know that the Coach was parked at YYCP at all material times.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Based on the above finding of fact, there can be no question of D breaching the employment contract.  D had been permitted to parkthe Coach in the vicinity of his residence and that was exactly what he did.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> There cannot be a claim on conversion in those circumstances either.

In any event, LIâs testimony is that he demanded D on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002 to return the Coach by 2 pm on the same day.  There is no evidence of P demandingfor the return of the Coach afterthe date of termination of the employment contract (i.e. after 14<sup>th</sup> September 2002) as pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(d) The 3 Covers</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> To recap, it is common ground that the 3 Covers were found missing from the Coach when MAN âfoundâ the Coach on 15<sup>th</sup> September 2002.  It is Pâs case that by removing the 3 Covers, D has breached the employment contract and/or committed the tortof conversion.  D admits to have removed the 3 Covers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> According to P, it is quite rare for the type of coach same as the Coach to be stolen.  It would suffice if drivers simply lock upafter work and Long Fai would not hold its drivers responsible for theft from or of the coaches assigned to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> MAN also gives similar evidence.  At one stage, he claimed that Long Fai was not concerned that its coaches might be stolen becauseit had bought comprehensive insurance for all its coaches.  However, upon further cross-examination, he retracted from this and allegesthat it is only common sense that no one would be interested to steal a coach manufactured by Mitsubishi or Isuzu!   It is notedthat the make of the Coach is Mitsubishi.  However, it is also his testimony that he felt it necessary to file a report with thepolice before actually recovering the Coach on 15<sup>th</sup> September because he was afraid that he might be mistaken as a thief and got beaten up!  If it were indeed common sense that no thiefwould be interested in the Coach, why did MAN hesitate in recovering the Coach on 15<sup>th</sup> September before going to the police?  After all, he did have the spare keys to the Coach, did he not?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> Whilst D admits that he removed the 3 Covers, he maintains that they were removed as a security measure to prevent the Coach frombeing stolen.  In any event, he has returned the 3 Covers to P through the police since 16<sup>th</sup> September 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> The question here is whether Dâs assertion of removing the 3 Covers as a security measure can be accepted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Ms. Wong has attempted to demonstrate in her examination of witnesses that the Coach without the 3 Covers might still be driven fora short while or distance and that was good enough for a thief.  In my view, that is quite beside the point. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Although P, MAN and LI all insist that they have not heard of removing the 3 Covers as a security measure before, it is clear fromMANâs evidence that he was unable to drive away the Coach in the evening of 15<sup>th</sup> September and had to await someone to tow it away on the following day. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> It is MANâs evidence that he noticed a strange noise the moment he ignited the engine on 15<sup>th</sup> September.  He then noticed that the big cover inside the driverâs compartment which covered the engine had been displaced.  Whenhe opened the big cover, he noticed the 3 Covers missing.  During re-examination, he explains that if he had tried to drive the Coachaway without the 3 Covers, hot coolant and lubricant would burst out from the uncovered tanks and might cause injury to him at thedriver seat.  In addition, the engine would eventually overheat and burn without sufficient coolant and lubricant. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> In my view, the effectiveness of Dâs alleged means of securing the Coach has been confirmed by the testimony of MAN.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Dâs act must also be viewed in its proper context.  It is common ground that the Coach was brand new when it was assigned to Dand no anti-theft security measure was installed.  Although it has been suggested that the more usual anti-theft measures adoptedby other coach drivers would be by means of steering wheel lock or brake lock, none had been supplied to D.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Ms. Wong has criticized D in her written closing submission for only employing such security measure over the weekends but not onweekdays.  D has explained that he would normally stayed across the border if he knew he had no order over the weekend.  So he wouldremove the 3 Covers to secure the Coach over such longer period.  I find Dâs explanation reasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> In the circumstances, I accept Dâs explanation and find that he had removed the 3 Covers as a security measure to prevent the Coachfrom being stolen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> Dâs act in securing the Coach is consistent with his obligation under the employment contract.  All employees are deemed to havea discretion to act for the protection of the employerâs property (see Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 18<sup>th</sup> Edition (2000), para.5-34).  This is all the more so as it is remembered that P had not instructed her employees to seek permissionbefore removing parts from their coaches.  As such, there cannot be any breach of the employment contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> There cannot be any conversion either as I have found what D did to be consistent with the right of P as owner of the Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(e) Item (8): $3,000 being additional wages paid to staff</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> P has adduced 2 receipts to support Pâs claim in this regard (at Agreed Bundle pp.596-597).  However, the sum total of these 2receipts, which is $3,755, does not support her claim of $3,000.  P has apparently noted this inconsistency in court and volunteersto limit her claim to $3,000 only.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Be that as it may, I am still not satisfied with the genuineness of these receipts.  These 2 receipts have been purportedly issuedto evidence payments to MAN and LI for their extra work on 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> September.  Both MAN and LI say they have already received payment and it is handwritten on each receipt the date of 30<sup>th</sup> September 2002.  If P has already paid them as early as 30<sup>th</sup> September 2002 and such payments have all along been evidenced by these receipts, I find it strange that P would claim for $3,000(but not $3,755) in her Statement of Claim dated 16<sup>th</sup> June 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(f) Item (2): $470 being towing charges</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Given my above finding that D was constructively dismissed by P, there is no basis for D to be responsible for any towing charges. In any event, the receipt produced by P (at Agreed Bundle p.593), which shows an amount of $400, does not tally with Pâs claimof $470!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(g) Item (3): $1,000 being change of lubricant with service fee</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> P has not satisfied me that this item is anything other than for general maintenance of the Coach to which P as owner should be responsible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(h) Item (5): $1,100 being replacement for car parts with service fee</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> P has failed to produce any documentary evidence to support this item of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> P has not satisfied me as to the circumstances of incurring this $1,100.  According to both P and MAN on the one hand, this sum of$1,100 is for the parts to replace the 3 Covers and was paid to the same garage which had changed the lubricant oil and servicedthe Coach (i.e. å»ºæ°è»æ¿).  P even claims that she has received a receipt from the garage but has since misplaced it.  However,it is LIâs evidence on the other hand that he himself bought the 3 Covers from Mitsubishi service centre and paid for them.  Hepassed the invoice to Long Fai and has been reimbursed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> In any event, MAN agrees that he has always knownthat the 3 Covers are being kept by the police and he could have obtained them fromthe police.  I am not satisfied that it was necessary to get replacement for the 3 Covers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(i) Item (4): $6,000 being loss of hiring contracts</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> The basis of Pâs claim here is that the Coach was under repair for 5 days.  But for the repair, P would have received hiring chargesin the sum of $6,000 from Avonwin (i.e. at $1,200 per day).  Pâs claim therefore is premised upon the fact that it has taken 5days to repair the Coach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> According to MAN, it required 5 days to repair the Coach because there was no available parts to replace the 3 Covers.  This is contradictedby LI who says that he managed to purchase the lubricant cover and the water-coolant cover from Mitsubishi service centre for theCoach (although he cannot quite remember exactly when he did that).  However, the small engine cover was out of stock and had tobe ordered in from Japan which would take 6 weeks.  In the meantime, the garage had used a wooden plank to act as a makeshift coverfor the small engine cover and the Coach was useable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Curious enough, LIâs evidence is consistent with MANâs witness statement filed herein (see paragraph 29 of MANâs witness statementat Agreed Bundle p.109) which stated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âBecause the Coach was required to be repaired, it was left with the service company Kin Sang Garage for 1 day.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> All in all, I am not satisfied with this item of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(j) Item (6): $9,000 being loss of hiring contracts</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> It is Pâs case that the Coach was hired to Avonwin at the material time.  As the Coach was repaired for 5 days, Avonwin hired areplacement coach at $1,800 per day for 5 days.  Hence, Long Fai paid $9,000 to Avonwin for this additional cost.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> To start with, this item is also premised upon the taking of 5 days to repair the Coach and I have already found against P in thisregard.  Secondly, no invoice or receipt is produced to evidence this payment of $9,000 to Avonwin and the payment is not reflectedin the accounting records of Avonwin either (see Agreed Bundle pp.561-567).  Thirdly, given Pâs case that Avonwin is paying P $1,200a day for the hiring of the Coach, the extra cost incurred by Avonwin (if any) in hiring the replacement coach for 5 days could onlyhave been $3,000 (i.e. ($1,800 â $1,200) x 5).  MAN has failed to provide any explanation on this discrepancy under cross-examination. Instead, he merely insists on the claim for $9,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>(j) Item (7): $100,000 being damages paid to customers in respect of disruption of contracts</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> This is perhaps the single most important item in Pâs claim by reason of the amount claimed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> According to P and MAN, the non-availability of the Coach to run Avonwinâs orders has caused business loss to Avonwin.  Eventually,P and Avonwin have agreed that P should pay $100,000 to Avonwin as compensation.  This agreement, according to Pâs case, has beenreduced in writing (see Agreed Bundle p.595).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> To start with, I find this alleged agreement highly suspicious in view of the intricate relationship between Long Fai and Avonwin. P says that she instructed MAN to negotiate with Avonwin and MAN says he negotiated with the other directors of Avonwin.  However,MAN himself holds 98 % of the shareholding in Avonwin and the remainder is held by P.  The other directors of Avonwin (i.e. otherthan P and MAN) do not have any beneficial interest in Avonwin!  Secondly, the written agreement produced at trial is apparentlyunsigned!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Most suspicious of all, it is Pâs case that the basis of the agreement on the amount of compensation of $100,000 is 10 % of theturnover of Avonwin for the months of July, August and September 2002 totaling $1,000,000.  P has even adduced the accounting recordsof Avonwin (at Agreed Bundle pp.561-567) purportedly to show that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="95%" valign="top" class="quote">the monthly turnover of Avonwin for the months of July, August and September 2002 is in the region of $300,000 odd; and</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="95%" valign="top" class="quote">there has been a significant drop in the turnover of Avonwin in the month of December 2002 to $254,400 (at Agreed Bundle p.564).</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">P and MAN both testify that it took about 3 months for Avonwinâs loss due to the non-availability of the Coach in September 2002to be reflected in the accounts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Mr. Iu has been most meticulous in scrutinizing Avonwinâs accounting records.

He says that D could do nothingif Long Fai was unwilling to offer such benefit and D eventually accepted the situation (i.e. without entitlement to end of yearpayment) by reporting to work.  It is also MANâs evidence that Long Fai has only offered end of year payment to one employee, namely,LI because LI is a supervisor. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> To start with, MANâs testimony that Long Fai has only offered end of year payment to LI is contradicted by his own evidence inthe Labour Tribunal.  On 28<sup>th</sup> November 2002, MAN has apparently told the Tribunal that many employees of Long Fai have received such benefit before (see the transcriptat 24K at Agreed Bundle p.171). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> More significantly, MANâs evidence that he did not offer end of year payment to D is contradicted by his own statement filed withthe Labour Tribunal.  In his statement to the Tribunal signed on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2002 (at Agreed Bundle pp.534-535), it is stated that D would be entitled to double pay upon completion of 12 monthsâwork.  When he is confronted with his own statement during cross-examination, he agrees that he did tell D that D would be entitledto end of year payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> MAN tries to salvage the situation by then insisting that Dâs entitlement to end of year payment should be conditional upon D completinga yearâs service and that such payment should be calculated on the basis of basic salary of $4,500 per month.  This last twistin MANâs testimony is particularly amazing.  First, that has never been Pâs pleaded case.  Secondly, P has clearly admitted onpleading that Dâs monthly basic salary should be $12,000.  MAN has failed to elaborate why Dâs end of year payment should becalculated on the basis of $4,500 per month but not the monthly salary of $12,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Although P was not present during the interview when the employment contract was concluded, her testimony may shred some light onthis issue.  After all, she is the sole-proprietress of Long Fai.  According to P, all drivers of Long Fai employed on monthly basisshould be entitled to end of year payment.  She, however, maintains that D is not entitled to such payment because D was employedon âdaily basisâ!  P has never alleged in her pleadings that P was employed on âdaily basisâ!  That much is admitted by Ms.Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> Insofar as D is concerned, he has consistently maintained that one of the terms of his employment agreement was that he was entitledto end of year payment.

Pâs allegation is said to bebased on Dâs own pleading that as far as D knew the routes operated by Long Fai designated to D were illegal (see Defence and Counterclaimpara.8(11) at Agreed Bundle pp.17).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  To start with, there is a presumption of legality.  According to Chitty on Contracts, 29<sup>th</sup> Edition (2004), para.16-193:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe party alleging the illegality of the contract bears the legal burden of proving this fact; therefore if the contract be reasonablysusceptible of two meanings or two modes of performance, one legal and the other not the legal burden of proving its illegality isundischarged and that interpretation is to be put upon the contract which will support it and give it operation.  If the contracton the face of it shows an illegal intention, an evidential burden lies upon the party supporting the contract to bring evidencereasonably capable of showing the legality of the intention.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> There is nothing illegal on the face of what I found to be the terms of the employment contract.  So the burden is on P (as the partyalleging illegality) to prove that fact.  However, P has denied on pleadings that the routes are illegal (see Re-Amended Reply andDefence to Counterclaim para.6(9) at Agreed Bundle p.614).  So the running of this most desperate allegation on the part of P isinconsistent with her pleaded case!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> Be that as it may, the evidence at trial in this regard is that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>				<td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">According to MAN, Avonwin hired coaches with driver from Long Fai to run Avonwinâs routes.  So, D had been assigned by Long Faito ply routes designated by Avonwin.  At all material times, Avonwin did not have the requisite licence from Transport Departmentto run those routes.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>				<td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">According to D, he was informed by the police that the routes that he plied for Long Fai were illegal.</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> Given MANâs role in Avonwin, he would be in a position to know whether the routes ran by Avonwin and designated to D were illegal. However, MANâs testimony at trial is contradicted by his evidence at the Labour Tribunal.  On 28<sup>th</sup> November 2002, he has apparently told the Tribunal that those routes were legal (see transcript at 16F-K at Agreed Bundle p.367).  I therefore find MANâs testimony in court to be suspicious.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> That leaves Dâs testimony.  However, Dâs understanding was apparently based on what he learnt from the police.  D was last interviewedby the police on 1<sup>st</sup> November 2002 (see Agreed Bundle p.321) and he has apparently complained to the Transport Department in November/December 2002 (seeAgreed Bundle p.201).  So the timing of Dâs complaint supports Dâs case that only learnt of such information from the police!</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> In the end, it is not at all clear whet the alleged illegality is.  Which route(s) is/are alleged to be illegal?  How is the runningof such route illegal?  What is/are the relevant legislative provision(s)?  What is/are the contravention(s) alleged?  All theseare neither covered by evidence nor dealt with in Pâs submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> All in all, I am not satisfied with the evidence before me that the routes assigned to D by P were illegal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> What P has tried very hard to say in this case is that the employment contract may be invalidated on the grounds of public policyso much so that D may not found his counterclaim on his employment contract.
