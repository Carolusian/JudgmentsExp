It is said that this actionof the police was taken under a search warrant. The personnel in question stayed on the premises for over an hour, and made a thoroughsearch. Resulting in also finding upon search things including a batch of sharpened iron bars and inflammatory posters.

Counsel for the defendant,on the other hand, contended that the judge did take notice of certain features of the disturbances but that, in any event, he wasnot bound to do so and, indeed, could not properly do so because the plaintiff had failed to plead particulars of these disturbancesin support of her legal innuendo.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The main weight of argument on the appeal has, however, been addressed to the plaintiff's contention that it was necessary for thejudge to ask himself and answer separately four questions; two of them being questions of law and two of them questions of fact.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Relying very largely on the case of <u>Knupffer v.

Unless the first question can be answered in favour of the appellant, the second question does not arise,and where the trial judge went wrong was in treating evidence to support the identification in fact as governing the matter, whenthe first question is necessarily, as a matter of law, to be answered in the negative.".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The case before the House was a jury case and no other Law Lord expressed himself as broadly as Lord Porter. His observations onthe procedure in a non-jury case are obiter. Taking the speeches as a whole I don't think they can properly be read to mean thatin all cases, however tried, the four questions must be asked and answered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Moreover, any such deduction would be in conflict with the view expressed by Diplock L.J., as he then was, in <u>Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd</u>.<sup>(3)</sup> where he analysed very thoroughly the source and significance of these different questions. After dealing with the determinationof the meaning to be ascribed to the words in question and the measure of control exercisable by a judge over a jury for the purposeof determining this issue, he said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          The exercise of this kind of control over juries in libel actions involved acknowledging that different men would not beunreasonable in ascribing different meanings to the same words. Hence the distinction between defamatory meanings which words arecapable of bearing and the particular defamatory meaning which, for the purposes of the tort of libel, they bear. The decision asto defamatory meanings which words are capable of bearing is reserved to the judge, and for this reason, and no other, is calleda question of law. The decision as to the particular defamatory meaning within that category which the words do bear is reservedto the jury, and for this reason, and no other, is called a question of fact ................</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          But where an action for libel is tried by a judge alone without a jury, it is he who has to arrive at a single 'right' meaningas 'the natural and ordinary meaning' of the words complained of; and with the concentration of functions in a single adjudicator,the need for his distinguishing between meanings which words are capable of bearing and the choice of the one 'right' meaning whichthey do bear disappears. It would be carrying artificiality too far, even for the law of libel, to suggest that a judge sitting alonemust approach the issue as to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of by asking himself not only the question:'What is the natural and ordinary meaning in which the words would be understood by reasonable men to whom they were published?'but also the further question: 'Could reasonable men understand them as bearing that meaning?'.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> However, counsel for the plaintiff has, with some justification, argued that if a judge sitting alone does not put to himself thefour specified questions, i.e. whether the article was capable of being defamatory, whether it was in fact defamatory, whether itwas capable of referring to the plaintiff and whether in fact it referred to the plaintiff, there may be difficulty in ascertainingon precisely what grounds a claim has been dismissed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Without necessarily subscribing to the view that it is essential for a judge sitting alone to ask himself and to answer each of thefour questions and without wishing to preclude the possibility of a judge, in such circumstances, selecting and dealing with onlyone of these questions if he found it decisive, one can recognize a danger if a short cut is taken or an attempt made to deal withthe matter compendiously that the reasons for the judge's decision may not emerge with the clarity that would follow from answeringthe four separate questions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In the present case I have found some difficulty in determining whether the judge thought the publication was capable of being defamatory.In the most relevant part of his judgment he sets out the allegations which he finds clearly capable of having a libellous meaningin a form somewhat different from those appearing in the article, but I am left with the impression that he did not regard the differenceas being material and that the intention was to convey the conclusion that the article was capable of being defamatory. Coming tothe fourth question, whether it was defamatory of the plaintiff, the judge certainly found that it was no libel on the plaintiffbut his language leaves it doubtful as to whether this conclusion was due to thinking that the article was incapable of referringto her or was not proved to have been published about her.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The importance of this distinction will emerge with greater clarity when I come to examine the facts which must be proved in an actionof this kind, where the plaintiff relies on a legal innuendo; for the moment I would say merely I am not satisfied that failure toask and answer separately each of the four specified questions is an error of law or procedure by a trial judge sitting alone butwe are still left with uncertainty in the present case as to how the trial judge reached his final compendious conclusion and whetherhe was right. Did he reach that conclusion because he thought the plaintiff was not sufficiently clearly identified in the articleor because he thought the article was not, in any event, defamatory of anybody with the possible exception of the two people wronglyalleged to have been arrested?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was contended for the defendants that there was no evidence of the plaintiff being the proprietress of the school, as the businessregistration certificate in respect of it was taken out after the filing of the writ. It seems to me, however, the even though, asthe judge found, she may not have had much knowledge of, or close contact with, day to day details, her evidence taken as a wholeshows that she was, in the ordinary sense of the term, the proprietress of the school. It is not a term of art and her uncontradictedstatements that her father used to run the school and supported it financially, that she took over after his death in 1964, thatshe owns the building in which it operates, that she is the registered manager and supervisor, that she takes the fees and standsthe losses - it being alleged that the school does run at a loss - and is known by those concerned with the school as the headmistressof it, seem to me, when taken together, sufficient to establish she was the proprietress of the school in the sense in which thatterm was used in her pleadings. I think she also showed that she played a prominent and important part in the school or, at least,would be regarded by members of the public as so doing.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> As for the contents of the article itself, the judgment, in the court below, gives much weight to the argument that merely to beassociated with the "left" or with communism did not necessarily mean that one supported or encouraged the disturbances which werethen troubling the Colony; as not all such individuals or organizations participated in or encouraged these disturbances. Withoutquestioning this argument, it seems to me that to allege a school had been raided by the police would inevitably tend to raise questionsin the minds of people who knew those responsible for running the school as to whether this responsibility was being duly and properlydischarged. To go further and allege, falsely as it appears in the present case, that sharpened bars etc. had been found on the schoolpremises and two people had been sent for interrogation, must enhance that anxiety and tend to lower in the minds of right-thinkingpeople their estimation of those responsible for running the school. Consequently and, subject to what I am going to say in a momentabout publication, I would have been disposed to think that this article was defamatory of those responsible for running the schooland that the plaintiff might have had a good cause of action if she had properly pleaded and proved a legal innuendo that someonewho saw and read the article knew her as the proprietress etc. of the school.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The necessity of proving a legal innuendo of this kind does not, perhaps, emerge with the greatest clarity from the English decisionsbut the point has been dealt with succinctly and clearly in certain Australian cases.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In <u>Consolidated Trust Co., Ltd. v.

This is not to say that the more fact that the name is not mentioned makes it essential to call a witness toprove that he identified the complainant by the description. To take an example used in argument, in an action against a widely circulatednewspaper for an alleged libel upon a plaintiff contained in an article which described him only as "the Prime Minister of Australia",it would be unnecessary to call a witness to prove that he had received the issue of the newspaper and knew who the Prime Ministerwas. In such a case the nature of the description would be such that special knowledge would be unnecessary to identify the personindicated: <u>Jones v. E. Hulton &amp; Co</u>.(7). But the less revealing the description the greater the danger of omitting proof of identification. It is hardly necessary toadd that it would be, to say the least, imprudent for a plaintiff who expected to obtain substantial damages to abstain from provingthe scope of the publication and its effect, in accordance with the usual practice in actions of defamation: cf. <u>Sunkissed Bananas (Tweed) Ltd. v.

No doubt if the publication were in a public newspaper and contained descriptive references reasonably capable of identifyingsome prominent personage it might be assumed that a substantial number of people would read or see and understand the matter complainedof and to whom it referred. Perhaps no further evidence might be necessary. But unless the description in the surrounding circumstancesshould approximate to a similar notoriety the position must differ in descending proportion to the extent of the clarity of the descriptionand of the probable number and knowledge of the readers. In order that a publication may injure the reputation of one who is attacked,there must be a reasonable probability of readers understanding the subject matter and to whom it relates. For example, if the descriptionand subject matter were in a foreign language evidence would certainly be required that the document reached a person or personscapable of understanding it: cf. <u>Amann</u> v. <u>Damm</u><sup>(9)</sup>.

The pamphlets were scattered in a picture theatre. On the following daya daily newspaper published a news item describing the incident together with some extracts from the pamphlet and ended with thewords "The pamphlets .... bore the imprint of Express Print, Auburn. ". The plaintiff, who carried on the business of the "X-pressPrintery" in Auburn, sued for damages and recovered a verdict, as it had been shown that some of his customers who read the newspaperitem and knew of his business at Auburn formed unfavourable conclusions about him as a result. Some doubt arose in the Full Courtas to whether the action in the lower court had been based upon the publication of the pamphlets to the audience at the picture theatre,the later publication in the newspaper being relied upon only as part of the damages flowing from the publication at the theatre,or on the later publication in the newspaper and further enquiry showed that it was the publication at the theatre which was thesubject of the action. In the course of his judgment, with which the other members of the Court agreed, Owen J. said :-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">But it was not enough for the plaintiff merely to show that the pamphlets were read by members of the public present at the theatre;it was necessary for him to prove also that the defamatory matter contained in the pamphlets was published "of and concerning" him,and this he failed to do, because no evidence was forthcoming that any member of the audience who read the pamphlet connected the"Express Print, Auburn" with the plaintiff. It is not only necessary that the words published should convey a defamatory meaning;they "must also convey a defamatory meaning of the plaintiff. If those who read or hear them, though understanding them in a defamatorymeaning, do not identify the plaintiff as the person referred to, there is no publication" (Gatley on Libel and Slander (2nd ed.) p.96). Where a defamatory statement refers to a plaintiff by name or, without mentioning him by name, describes him in such a waythat the man in the street reading or hearing it would know to whom it referred - as for example where without mentioning names thestatement is defamatory of a person who is described as the holder of a particular office - and it is a matter of general notorietywho the holder of that office is - evidence that some one or more persons who read or heard the statement understood it as referringto the plaintiff is unnecessary. But where, as here, the plaintiff could only be identified by that small percentage of the communitywhich happened to know that he was a printer using the imprint "X-press Printery", it must be shown that some one or more of thoseto whom the pamphlet was published had that special knowledge. The case in this ...(illegible) respect is on all fours with <u>Consolidated Trust Co., Ltd.</u> v. <u>Browne</u><sup>(4)</sup>, and, so far as publication at the theatre is concerned, the plaintiff failed to prove an essential element necessary to establishthe tort of defamation.".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> When Jordan C.J. in the earlier case referred to English authorities on privilege as supporting his construction he presumably hadin mind <u>Sadgrove</u> v. <u>Hole</u><sup>(11)</sup> where a postcard had been sent to a person in respect of whom privilege could properly be claimed.

The plaintiff failed because he failedto prove that anyone with knowledge which would connect the plaintiff with the contents, other than the addressee, who fell withinthe privilege, had read the postcard: consequently he had not satisfied the onus of proving publication of libellous matter concerninghimself.

Where it is the plaintiff whorelies on such extrinsic facts, he need only show that some of the persons to whom the words were published knew the facts, sincehe will have been defamed to them. 'So far as concerns knowledge on the part of the persons to whom the words complained of are published,no difficulty presents itself.

That argument, for what it is worth, could not, I think,be valid in the present circumstances because the plaintiff could not be said to enjoy the degree of prominence contemplated by DavidsonJ.. If the matter is one of degree, this case falls, I think, on the side where evidence is necessary.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> During the course of the argument, attention was also directed to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21">Cap.21</a>, and the necessity, even when an action is consolidated, of taking a separate verdict for and against each defendant in thesame way as if the actions had been tried separately. As the judgment had gone against the plaintiff in the court of trial, the pointwas not material there but counsel for the plaintiff suggested that it was also not material on this appeal. The main weight of hisargument in this behalf was based on the case of <u>Hopley</u> v. <u>Williams</u><sup>(15)</sup>, but that case cannot, I think, advance his argument because, in it, publication appears to have been admitted and the only issuebefore the court was the amount of the damages, which the defendants therein suggested should be contemptuous, but which could properlybe found as one sum and subsequently apportioned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In the present case, the fact that the statements of claim were originally drafted so as to name the school as the plaintiff, anerror which was subsequently met by an amendment the consequential details of which do not appear to have been fully worked out inthe body of the pleadings, has left them in a somewhat hazy and unsatisfactory state. Nevertheless, the defence specifically deniedthat the article had been published of the plaintiff. Consequently she faced an onus of proving such publication in respect of eachdefendant and, on the strength of the authorities already mentioned, I think that included the onus of proving that the article inthe defendants paper had been published to at least one reader who knew the circumstances of the plaintiff's relationship with theschool. As this aspect was apparently overlooked by counsel on either side it seems not unnaturally to have been hardly touched uponin the evidence. The only passages which, to my mind, could lend any support to an argument that, at least in respect of one newspaper,the onus had been discharged, occurred when the plaintiff, in the course of her examination-in-chief, gave the following answers:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">A</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="70%" class="quote">I read one newspaper, and then I bought all the newspapers.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="70%" class="quote">Look at Ex.15.

The Courtof Appeal upheld these contentions and the plaintiff appealed to the House of Lords. Lord Atkinson, who made the leading speech forthe majority, having reviewed a number of cases, said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">My Lords, ........ it is, in my view, now impossible to deny that if the Court of Appeal should in any given case be of opinion, first,that they have all the facts before them, and that there is no reason to think that further evidence of importance could be producedat another trial, and, secondly, should be also of opinion that the evidence given at the trial was such that the presiding judgeshould, if asked by the defendant's counsel, have either nonsuited the plaintiff or directed a verdict for the defendant, that Courthas now power under Order LVIII., r.4, not only to set aside a verdict found for the plaintiff, but in addition to enter judgmentfor the defendant. If the Court can do this, as these cases decide it can, where there is conflicting evidence in a case, but anoverwhelming balance of it on one side, it would be strange indeed if the same Court should not have power to do it where there isno evidence proper and sufficient to sustain a verdict found for a plaintiff, simply because the counsel for the defendant has atthe trial omitted to ask that this should be done. To hold so would appear to me to make this doctrine that parties are to be boundby the course of the trial an instrument of great injustice.".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Lord Atkinson then went on to quote the passage from Lord Herschell's judgment already mentioned and said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">          The rules here laid down, admirable and just in a case to which they apply, have no application whatever to a case likethe present, where all the defendants ask for is to get the opportunity to show that the verdict found against them has no properevidence to support it, and object to be shut out from doing this by the omission of a technical formality. In my opinion, therefore,the omission of the defendants' counsel at the trial to address to the judge the requisition I have mentioned did not, having regardto the provisions of Order LVIII., r.4, deprive the Court of Appeal of jurisdiction to make the order they have made based upon thefirst ground.

It was contended that, inasmuch as the matter was left to thejury without objection on behalf of the respondent bank, it was not open to the Court of Appeal to inquire whether there was evidencewhich could justify the jury, as reasonable men, in finding as they did. This contention does not appear to have been raised in theCourt of Appeal. The fact that the respondent bank had not objected to the matter being left to the jury was no doubt mentioned,but rather as showing that there must have been evidence for the jury to consider than as excluding the jurisdiction of the Court.It would perhaps be enough to say that the point, not having been taken in the Court of Appeal, must be treated as waived and isnot open before your Lordships' House. But in my opinion the point, if taken in the Court of Appeal, must have been overruled. Thereare no doubt cases in which the Court of Appeal have refused to allow points of law not taken in the Court of first instance to beraised on appeal. But these cases do not go to jurisdiction, but to discretion. It may be that if a point of law had been taken belowfurther evidence would have been adduced, or a further or different question left to the jury. In such cases it would be manifestlyunfair and unjust to allow the point to be raised for the first time in the Court of Appeal. In the present case there is no suchelement of unfairness or injustice. It is not suggested that had the point been taken below any further evidence could have beenadduced, or any further or different question left to the jury. Why, then, should not the Court of Appeal have felt itself at libertyto do complete justice between the parties on the evidence before them? I can see no reason at all. It was suggested that, havingregard to the nature of the point of law in this particular case, the old nisi prius procedure was of some materiality, and showedthat the point, if taken at all, must be taken at the trial. I cannot agree. The difference between there being no evidence to goto the jury and the jury's verdict being against the weight of evidence was no doubt of more importance then than it is now. It maybe that the former point had to be taken by asking a direction from the trial judge, but clearly the latter point could not be takenat the trial. It could only be raised on motion for a new trial. It must, therefore, have always been open in the Court which hadjurisdiction to grant a new trial. That Court is now the Court of Appeal. But the Court of Appeal have certain further powers underthe Rules of the Supreme Court, Order LVIII. Instead of granting a new trial, they can, in a proper case, direct judgment to be enteredfor the defendant. They ought, in my opinion, to exercise this power whenever such a course will, in their opinion, do complete justicebetween the parties - for example, when they have all the available evidence before them, and there is no chance of a new trial bringingto light other material facts. It appears to me that this is precisely that case. See <u>Millar</u> v. <u>Toulmin</u> (22).".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The passages in these speeches referring to the possibility of producing further evidence at another trial call for further attention.They must, I think, refer to instances where a new trial would have been available for other reasons and should not be read as implyingthat if, at the conclusion of a party's evidence, it is insufficient to establish his case he should be given an opportunity, merelyon that account, of doing so at another trial.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Bearing in mind that the judgments from which I have quoted deal with the position of an appellant it is necessary to consider whetherthe principles emerging from them are equally applicable to a respondent. Until recently, a respondent who was not seeking to varyan order made in the court below and consequently not affected by the need to file a cross-appeal was not restricted by rules ofcourt from supporting the judgment of the lower court on grounds not relied upon by the trial court but now, under O.59 r.6(2), recentlyintroduced in Hong Kong as in England, the respondent seeking to rely on such new ground is required to give notice to the otherside. In the absence of such notice O.59 r.6(3) gives to the court a discretion as to whether the respondent should be allowed torely on the new argument.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Counsel for the defendants has argued that no such notice was necessary in the case before us, but counsel also requested that, ifthe court took the contrary view, then leave to rely should be given. I am satisfied that notice should have been given and thatif reliance is to be placed on this ground leave is necessary. It does not seem to me inconsistent with the principles emerging fromthe cases already quoted to grant leave in the present case. The course of proceeding in the court of trial would not have been differentif, at the conclusion of the evidence, counsel had raised this point. He had, by his pleading, put on the plaintiff the onus of proofthat there was a publication about the plaintiff. The plaintiff's legal advisers knew that they had to meet that onus. No occasionto argue that they had failed to meet it arose until they had called their evidence and closed that part of their case. If raisedat that time, which would have been the appropriate time to raise it, the issues before the court and the evidence on which theyfell to be decided would not have differed from those now before us. Consequently I think the defendants should be allowed to raisethe point but on terms to which I will refer later.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> During the course of the hearing before us, in anticipation of leave being granted or found unnecessary, every opportunity was givento counsel for the plaintiff to meet this particular point and, in the course of doing so, he argued that because the judge had misdirectedhimself in holding, for reasons which do not emerge with any clarity from the judgment, that the article was not defamatory to theplaintiff, the proper order to make would be to direct a new trial at which this new point about the absence of evidence of publicationand other matters could be fully explored and examined.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> If one looks at this matter in the manner most favourable to the plaintiff and construes the judgment in the court below as indicatingthat the judge misdirected himself on the law by holding that the article was incapable of being understood to be defamatory of theplaintiff, it would still be necessary for the plaintiff to show that in such circumstances a new trial should be ordered becausesome substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been thereby occasioned (O.59 r.11(2)).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> No such wrong <u>or</u> miscarriage could have occurred if the evidence produced by the plaintiff was not sufficient to establish the case even with a properdirection. Without proof of publication the evidence would have been insufficient and, as already indicated, the proof of publicationwas insufficient.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The argument that, by means of a new trial, the plaintiff should be given an opportunity of filling the gap left in her evidencewould appear to be clearly precluded by the principle recognized in a well-known passage from the speech of Lord Chelmsford in <u>Shedden</u> v. <u>Patrick and the Attorney General</u><sup>(23)</sup> which is quoted in <u>Letchumanan Chettiar</u> v. <u>Sadayappa Chettiar</u><sup>(24)</sup> :</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" class="quote">It is an invariable rule in all the courts, and one founded upon the clearest principles of reason and justice, that if evidence whicheither was in the possession of parties at the time of a trial, or by proper diligence might have been obtained, is either not produced,or has not been procured, and the case is decided adversely to the side to which the evidence was available, no opportunity for producingthat evidence ought to be given by the granting a new trial.".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="4%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The <u>Chettiar</u> case<sup>(24)</sup>, where this principle was applied, might well be thought to have presented features more strongly favouring the appellant than thepresent case because the trial judge in that case had wrongly ruled that the onus of proof on the vital issue rested on the respondent,and it was contended that this ruling played a major part in inducing the appellant not to call the relevant evidence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Sub-rules (2) and (3) of rule 6 of O.59 are relatively new both in England and Hong Kong and there has as yet been little time forthe emergence of judicial authorities indicating how they should be applied. In this case I would, as already indicated, adopt alenient approach in permitting the defendants to benefit from sub-rule (3) but defendants should not be allowed to increase the costspayable by the other side through failure to comply with sub-rule (2). At the conclusion of the case in the lower court the plaintiffwas not entitled to succeed because she had failed to prove an essential ingredient in her case. It looks as if it may have beenan ingredient which, if she and her legal advisers had appreciated the necessity, could have been proved in respect of at least someof the defendants. Had the matter been raised in the court below, that might well have been the end of the case and we might haveheard nothing of this appeal. The failure of the defendants to raise it then has led to a lengthier hearing of this appeal duringwhich other arguments have been advanced to us in support of the judgment in the court below, which I would not be prepared to acceptbecause I think the article was defamatory of those responsible for the school and the plaintiff was in this category but failedbecause she did not prove publication to anyone who knew of her position in the school. Had the plaintiff, when first made awareof this particular point, accepted it as valid and not sought to contest the matter I think it might well have been appropriate tohave imposed on the defendants the condition that reliance could only be placed on the point if the defendants were prepared to meetall the costs of the appeal. But, in the circumstances, I think the fair order to make would be that the order in the court belowwill stand but that, as a condition of allowing the defendants to rely on the only contention which in my opinion could support thelower court's decision, the defendants will pay one half of the plaintiff's costs in the Court of Appeal.
