Arising from that ruling, it became necessaryfor the plaintiff to furnish further particulars in relation to the plaintiff's proposed amendments.  Therefore the order made atthat time was to adjourn the plaintiff's application to amend pending the particulars (or further particulars which the defendantmay seek) to be supplied relating to the proposed amendments.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The present application before me is the defendant's application by Summons dated 24 March 2006 asking that the proposed amendmentsby the plaintiff be disallowed.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The basis of the defendant's application to disallow the proposed amendments is that the proposed amendments seek to introduce anew cause of action which is, at the time of the application to amend, statute-barred and that the court has no jurisdiction to allowthe amendment sought.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> This application of the defendant to disallow the proposed amendments is opposed by the plaintiff who maintains that the amendmentsdo not introduce a new cause of action but which merely seek to clarify on the cause of action already pleaded by the plaintiff inthe Statement of Claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiff's claim before amendments</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiff claims against the defendant for damages to herself and on behalf of the estate of her deceased husband arising fromthe death of her husband (âthe deceasedâ).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> It is common ground that the deceased and the plaintiff were beaten by one Tang Kin Kwong (âTangâ) armed with a wooden pole on30 December 2000 and the deceased died on 1 January 2001 from the injuries sustained from that beating.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> It is the plaintiff's case that in about April 1999, the defendant had in one episode of a television programme compiled by the defendantand aired on the local television by the name of âTo See Better Todayâ attempted to expose Tang who claimed to practise as aChinese herbalist and was able to cure cancer with tree roots.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> In that episode, the deceased, who also practised as a Chinese herbalist several shop spaces from Tang's clinic was also interviewedby the defendant and who was asked for comments on Tang's claims of being able to cure cancer.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The main thrust of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was that when the deceased was interviewed by the defendant and askedto comment on Tang's claims, initially the deceased had refused to give the interview, but later agreed after the deceased had beenassured by the interviewing crew from the defendant that the deceased's image would not appear in the programme during its broadcastand that the deceased would not be harmed in any way and therefore the defendant owed a duty of care to the deceased to take reasonablesteps to keep the deceased's identity in confidence when broadcasting the interview with the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> It is the plaintiff's case that when the programme was aired, nothing was done by the defendant to cover up the identity of the deceasedin the interview given by the deceased to the TV crew of the defendant, thereby being in breach of its duty of care owed to the deceasedand his family as well as being in breach of the assurance given.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim was pleaded as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe aforesaid attack perpetrated by Tang on the Deceased and the Plaintiff was caused by the breach of the agreement and/or negligenceof the Defendant through its servant and/or agent in failing to keep the Deceased's identity confidential during the broadcast ofthe interview of the Deceased, knowing that failing which the Deceased as well as the family would be exposed to risk of violence,hostility and physical harm from Tang.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">                   PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)    Wrongfully showing the face and broadcasting the comment made by the Deceased in the programme.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)   Revealing the name of the Deceased in the programme.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)   Failing to cover, conceal, disguise the image and voice of the Deceased.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iv)  Failing to heed the Deceased's warning that the broadcast of the programme without concealing his identity would jeopardizehis family's safety.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(v)   Alternatively, failing to heed any risk of vengeance upon the Deceased, the Plaintiff and their family.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(vi)  Failing to give any or any sufficient consideration to the safety of the Deceased, the Plaintiff and their family.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The proposed amendments</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The amendments proposed by the plaintiff is to add a further sub-paragraph (vii) to the particulars of negligence pleaded in paragraph9 of the Statement of Claim.  The proposed amendments read as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(vii)  Having regard to the condition of Tang as exhibited in the programme, the Defendant should have taken effective steps toavoid any harm or risk of harm to anyone appearing in the programme, in particular, Tang and the Deceased.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> After the adjournment of the trial on 12 January, voluntary particulars relating to the proposed amendments have been supplied bythe plaintiff to the defendant.  Those voluntary particulars relate to âthe condition of Tangâ as well as to the âeffectivestepsâ which the defendant should have taken.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Thereafter, the defendant has sought even further and better particulars of the voluntary particulars which have also been answeredby the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The defendant's application</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In a nutshell, the basis of the defendant's application to disallow the proposed amendments, as already stated above, is that theamendments plead a new cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It is submitted by the defendant that the further particulars given by the plaintiff relies on the âunhealthy mental conditionâof Tang which the plaintiff says can be gauged objectively from the interview of Tang in the programme.  Since no mention had beenmade of Tang's âunhealthy mental conditionâ in the original pleadings, which only relies on the assurances given to the plaintiffand the deceased at the time the deceased was interviewed, it is said that these amendments tantamount to a new cause of action notoriginally pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In this respect, the defendant refers to Order 20 rule 5(5) which reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAn amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute anew cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of actionin respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The deceased died on 1 January 2001 from the attack by Tang.  The application for the proposed amendment, raising this new causeof action is well after the limitation period of 3 years in a fatal injuries claim.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The law and practice is such that the court would only have jurisdiction to allow such an amendment if the new cause of action aroseout of âthe same facts or substantially the same factsâ as the original cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In the present case, the original cause of action pleaded was the assurance given to the plaintiff and the deceased by the TV crewof the defendant but that the new cause of action arises from the âunhealthy mental conditionâ of Tang, which was not even pleadedin the original pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> For these reasons the defendant asks that the application to amend be disallowed.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Firstly, I am not persuaded by the defence that the proposed amendments raise a new cause of action for the following reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim (without the proposed amendments) makes it clear that the plaintiff's claim was brought inboth contract and tort.  It pleaded the breach of the agreement (i.e. based on the assurances given) and also pleaded expressly ânegligenceâas an alternative. Indeed the original six items of particulars given in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim were particulars ofnegligence.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Moreover, the case, when it was opened by Mr Lee, leading counsel for the plaintiff, was opened on both contract and tort.  In hisopening Mr Lee specifically referred to <i>Chitty on Contract</i> at page 1448 as to the remoteness of damage, as well as to <i>Clark and Lindsell on Tort</i> at page 120 paragraph 2-115 as to the foreseeability of damage in a case of tort and indicated that he would take a broad approachwhen referring to paragraph 2-126 in respect of the law applicable in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Therefore there can be no doubt that the plaintiff had pleaded and relied on negligence as well as breach of contract in his originalclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The act or omission complained of by the plaintiff was the failure of the defendant to cover up the identity of the deceased whenthe defendant aired the interview with the deceased commenting on Tang's practice and claim of being able to cure cancer with treeroots on its programme âTo See Better Todayâ.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> That still remains to be the act or omission complained of by the plaintiff even with the proposed amendments.  Therefore nothinghas changed in so far as the act of negligence goes.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The effect of the proposed amendment merely serve to allow the plaintiff to say why, based on the contents of the interview of Tangby the defendant, the defendant ought to have the knowledge that if it failed to keep the deceased identity confidential during thebroadcast of the interview with the deceased, the deceased and his family would be exposed to risk of violence, hostility and physicalharm from Tang, a matter which had already been pleaded in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I therefore do not accept the submission of the defendant that the effect of the proposed amendments is to add (or substitute) anew cause of action which had hitherto not been relied on by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Secondly, I must also consider the prejudice, if any, which may be caused by this late amendment.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In this respect I take into account that the mental condition of Tang was a matter known to both parties, especially after Tang'sevidence given in the criminal trial in which he was the defendant being charged with the killing of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Indeed that was the very basis for the parties to have instructed their respective psychiatric experts to prepare expert reportsand to give evidence in this case relating to the mental condition of Tang.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Moreover, much of what the plaintiff attempts to rely on in her proposed amendments and the further particulars given were mattersalready commented upon by the host of the programme broadcasted by the defendant and/or by the respective psychiatric experts instructedin this case.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In any event, the defendant have not completed their evidence and there is no objection by the plaintiff for the defendant to adduceany further relevant evidence which is necessary for the defendant to meet the amendments of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Finally, it must be said that the contents of that programme has all along been a central piece of evidence in this case, even beforethe application by the plaintiff to amend.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Given the above, there can be little or no prejudice to the defendant which cannot be cured by consequential orders allowing forfurther evidence from the defendant, both expert and factual, should such be necessary, to meet the amendments proposed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In the circumstances, I am prepared to allow the amendments sought by the plaintiff together with the further particulars alreadygiven by the plaintiff relating to such amendments.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Accordingly, I shall order that paragraph 1 of the Summons dated 24 March 2006 taken out by the defendant be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> There will be the following further orders in respect of both actions :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The plaintiff in both actions do have leave to amend the Statement of Claim by adding the proposed sub-paragraph (vii) tothe Particulars of Negligence pleaded in paragraph 9 thereof;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     leave to the defendant to amend its Defence in both actions within 28 days of this Order;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     leave to the parties to exchange supplemental expert reports if so advised within 28 days thereafter;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     leave to the parties to exchange supplemental/additional witness statement if so advised within 42 days from this Order.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> There will be a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of and occasioned by such amendments be to the defendant in any event but that the costs of the hearing on 28 April2006 be borne by the defendant in any event.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The plaintiff's own costs be taxed in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> (A.R.
