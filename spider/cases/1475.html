At that time, the plaintiff was a front seat passenger in the car registration number JR3106 (âthecarâ) driven by her husband along Princess Margaret Road southbound.  Following the car was a taxi registration number GK3824. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was driving a light goods vehicle registration number FG7310 along the same lane of Princess Margaret Road following thetaxi.  The car stopped on reaching the junction with Chung Man Street.  The taxi which was following the car also stopped.  The lightgoods vehicle did not stop in time and ran into the rear of the taxi.  As a result of this the taxi went forward and hit the rearof the car causing the plaintiff to sustain personal injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> These proceedings were commenced on 19 September 2006 by the issue of the writ of summons.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On 24 October 2006 interlocutory judgment was entered against the defendants for damages to be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> This is the trial of the assessment of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff is now 40 years old.  At the time of the accident she was 35 years old.  She was employed at that time as a Legal Counselat the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (âPCOâ).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in April 1994.  From 1994 to 2000 she was a litigation solicitor in privatepractice in Messrs Yung Yu Yuen.  She married her husband in 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiff joined the PCO in June 2000 as a Legal Counsel.  At that time there was only one other Legal Counsel there namely,Ms Brenda Kwok Mei Ling (âMs Kwokâ).  Later on there was also an additional temporary Legal Counsel.  The plaintiff joined thePCO on a contract for 3 years.  That contract was renewed in June 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Ms Kwok joined the PCO in February 1997.  Although she had more experience in the PCO than the plaintiff, Ms Kwok had less post-qualifyingexperience as a solicitor as she was admitted to practice in July 1995. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The two Legal Counsel were under the direct supervision of the head of the Legal Division namely, Mr Eric Pun (âMr Punâ) whowas the Legal Director.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Mr Pun left his post at the PCO in March 2003.  There was a vacancy for his post.  As a result of a restructuring, the title of LegalDirector was replaced by the title of Chief Legal Counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that but for the accident she would have been promoted to take over Mr Punâs vacant post. It is her casethat she would have been promoted to be Chief Legal Counsel.  Instead, Ms Kwok was promoted.  Ms Kwok became the Acting Chief LegalCounsel in October 2003 and she became the Chief Legal Counsel in February 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In October 2003 the plaintiff also developed psychiatric symptoms.  This adversely affected her working performance at the PCO. Her second contract at the PCO was due to expire in June 2006 but in May 2006 she was informed that her contract would not be renewed. Her case is that but for the accident her contract at the PCO would have been renewed.</p>    <p class="heading">The applicable legal principles</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The applicable legal principles are not disputed.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In considering whether the accident caused the physical and psychiatric illness, it is useful to bear in mind what is stated at paragraph2-137 <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> Edn as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIt is not uncommon for a claimant to develop a major psychiatric condition following a relatively minor physical injury.  Providedthat a causal connection (medically) can be demonstrated between the physical injury and the psychiatric condition, the defendantis liable in full for the psychiatric consequences, no matter how unforeseeable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> It is also important to bear in mind that where it is established that physical injury to a claimant, who was a primary victim ofthe accident, was foreseeable, it is unnecessary to ask whether it was foreseeable that the claimant would suffer psychiatric injury.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In <i>Simmons v British Steel plc</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] UKHL 20</a> the pursuer sustained head injuries in the course of employment.  He was wearing protective head gear.  He sustained a severe blowto the head but the head injury was not as serious as it might have been.  However, the consequences of the accident were not confinedto the physical injuries.  After the accident the pursuer experienced an exacerbation of a pre-existing skin condition and he developeda change in personality which resulted in a severe depressive illness.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In his opinion in the House of Lords, Lord Hope said at paragraph 21:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â The fact that the pursuer sustained physical injuries in the accident for which the defenders have been found liable makes itunnecessary, applying <i>Page v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 155</a>, to ask whether the psychiatric injury from which he has also been suffering was reasonably foreseeable.  The pursuer is in the positionof a primary victim of the accident on Lord Lloydâs analysis, which has been followed and applied in Scotland: see <i>Fraser v State Hospitals Board for Scotland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2001%20SLT%201051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2001 SLT 1051</a>, per Lord Carloway.  So no distinction needs to be made between his initial physical injuries and his subsequent mental state.  Theduty of care which the defenders owed to the pursuer extended to the psychiatric symptoms as well as to the physical consequences. They must take their victim as they find him, so the aggravation of his psoriasis and the anger which led to his depressive mentalillness can both be assumed to fall within the scope of their liability, so long as there was a causal connection between these symptomsand the accident.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> As Lord Hope said at paragraph 18:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â â¦â¦â¦â¦   The general rule is that it must be shown that the injury would not have occurred but for the act or omission ofthe defender.  But if a number of factors contributed to the injury it is sufficient that the contribution which the factor attributableto the defenderâs fault made to the injury was material: <i>Wardlaw v Bonnington Castings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1956%20SC%20%28HL%29%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1956 SC (HL) 26</a>, 32 per Lord Reid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I would also refer to what Lord Rodger said in his opinion at paragraphs 55 and 56:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â 55.   Since the pursuer in the present case actually suffered physical injuries as a result of the defendersâ fault and negligence,the starting point is that he is a primary victim in terms of Lord Lloydâs classification.  Mr Smith argued, however, that thepursuerâs psoriasis and his depressive illness sprang not from the accident itself, but from his anger at the happening of theaccident.  Hence he could not recover damages.  I see no reason to give effect to such a distinction, even supposing that it canbe realistically drawn in a given case.  Regret, fear for the future, frustration at the slow pace of recovery and anger are allemotions that are likely to arise, unbidden, in the minds of those who suffer injuries in an accident such as befell the pursuer. If, alone or in combination with other factors, any of these emotions results in stress so intense that the victim develops a recognizedmental illness, there is no reason in principle why he should not recover damages for that illness.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">56.   Not only is there no hint of the distinction advocated by Mr Smith in Lord Lloydâs speech in <i>Page v Smith</i>, but indeed the whole thrust of the speech is to quite the opposite effect.  On Lord Lloydâs approach, all that matters is thatthe defenders were in breach of their duty of care not to expose the pursuer to the risk of personal injury and that, as a resultof the breach, the pursuer suffered both physical and psychiatric injuries.  The defenders are liable in damages for both types ofinjury and, in particular, for the exacerbation of the pursuerâs psoriasis and for the depressive illness which followed - evenif those developments were not reasonably foreseeable.  Moreover, as the Second Division rightly held,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2003%20SLT%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2003 SLT 62</a>, 67E, it does not matter whether a psychologically more robust individual would have recovered from the accident without displayingeither condition: the defenders must take their victim as they find him.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> A contribution which comes within the exception <i>de minimis non curat lex</i> is not material, but any contribution which does not fall within that exception must be material (per Lord Reid in <i>Wardlaw</i> at page 32 as cited by Lord Hope at paragraph 26 in <i>Simmons</i>). </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the High Court of Australia in <i>Shorey v PT Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%20197%20ALR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) 197 ALR 410</a> Kirby J (as he then was) succinctly stated the principle at paragraph 41:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â It is a basic principle of the law governing the recovery of damages that a claimant does not have to prove â¦â¦â¦. that animpugned event was âtheâ cause, in the sense of the one and only cause.  It is enough that the claimant shows that the eventis âaâ cause of the condition for which damages are claimedâ¦â¦.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> He also said at paragraph 44:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âThe principle of law is that a negligent defendant must take its victim as it finds her and must pay damages accordingly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Thus the court has to consider whether as a matter of fact the accident was a materially contributing cause of the physical injuriesas well as the psychiatric illness.  The burden is on the plaintiff to show this on a balance of probabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As to the proper approach in considering the question of causation in the light of the medical evidence, this was re-affirmed byCheung JA in <i>Li Sau Keung v Maxcredit Engineering Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20HKC%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 HKC 434</a> at paragraph 54 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â <i>The proper approach</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">54.

In <i>Davies v Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] A.C. 207</a> at 213, Lord Reid stated that</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">â ... You can prove that a past event happened, but you cannot prove that a future event will happen and I do not think that thelaw is so foolish as to suppose that you can.  All that you can do is to evaluate the chance.  Sometimes it is virtually 100 percent.: sometimes virtually nil.  But often it is somewhere in between.  And if it is somewhere in between I do not see much differencebetween a probability of 51 per cent and a probability of 49 per cent.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">42. Consistent with this approach, the English Court of Appeal in <i>Allied Maples Group v Simmons &amp; Simmons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%201602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 1602</a> at 1610 per Stuart-Smith LJ held that</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">â Questions of quantification of the plaintiffâs loss, however, may depend upon future uncertain events.  For example, whetherand to what extent he will suffer osteoarthritis, whether he will continue to earn at the same rate until retirement, whether, butfor the accident, he might have been promoted.  It is trite law that these questions are not decided on a balance of probability,but rather on the courtâs assessment, often expressed in percentage terms, of the risk eventuating or the prospect of promotion,which it should be noted depends in part at least on the hypothetical acts of a third party, namely the plaintiffâs employer.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">43. This was expanded later in the judgment under the third category of situations which may arise where the plaintiffâs loss dependsupon the action of an independent third party.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">44. The three situations are best summarised by Otton LJ in <i>Doyle v Wallace</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PIQR%20Q146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PIQR Q146</a> at Q149 as follows :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">â (1) In his first category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of some positive act or misfeasance and thequestion of causation was one of historical fact, in which event proof on the balance of probability prevailed.</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">(2) In the second category fell cases in which the defendantâs negligence consisted of an omission where caution depended not upona question of historical fact but upon the answer to the hypothetical question âwhat would the plaintiff have done if there hadbeen no negligence?â; here the answer is provided by the application of proof on the balance of probabilities.</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">(3) In the third category fell cases in which the plaintiffâs loss depended upon the hypothetical action of a third party, whetherin addition to action by the plaintiff or independently of it; here the plaintiff need only show that he had a substantial chanceof the third party acting in such a way as to benefit him.  The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs needed to show only thatthere was a significant chance, which could be less than likely, that the third party would have been prepared to offer them thisprotection and held that the loss of such a chance had been made out and it was assessed at 50 per cent.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">For ease of reading I have numbered the three situations.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Mr Ashok Sakhrani, counsel for the defendants, did not dispute the relevant legal principles.  He, however, submitted that in consideringthe question of whether but for the accident the plaintiff would have been promoted and whether the plaintiffâs employment contractwould have been renewed, the case fell within the first category of cases summarized by Otton LJ in <i>Doyle v Wallace</i> as set out above at paragraph 44 of Cheung JAâs judgment.  He submitted that the question of causation was, on the plaintiffâscase, one of historical fact and that as such the plaintiff had to prove the same on a balance of probabilities.  I am unable toaccept this submission.  In my view this case falls within the third category of cases as set out above at paragraph 44 of CheungJAâs judgment.  It seems to me that whether the plaintiff would have been promoted or whether her contract would have been reneweddepended on the hypothetical action of a third party namely, the Commissioner of the PCO (âthe Commissionerâ).  That being so,the plaintiff need only show a substantial chance of the Commissioner acting in such a way as to benefit her.  She only needs toshow a substantial chance that she would have been promoted and that her contract would have been renewed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I heard evidence from the plaintiff and from Ms Kwok.  I found both of them to be honest, credible and truthful witnesses.  I alsofound them to be reliable witnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The medical evidence</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The medical evidence is not disputed.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> By consent, it was ordered on 19 July 2007 by Master B. Kwan that the report of the plaintiffâs treating orthopaedic expert DrDanny Tsoi (âDr Tsoiâ) dated 2 September 2004 and the report of the plaintiffâs treating psychiatrist Dr Sylvia Chen (âDrChenâ) dated 18 August 2006 should be adduced without oral evidence.  Those reports were in evidence before me.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> There was also a joint orthopaedic report of Dr Lam Kwong Chin (âDr Lamâ) dated 9 December 2004 and a supplemental joint orthopaedicreport of Dr Lam dated 23 December 2004.  There was also a joint psychiatric report of Dr Wong Chung Kwong (âDr Wongâ) dated28 February 2007.  Those joint reports were also in evidence before me.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> There is no dispute that the plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result of the accident.  She sustained relatively minor physicalinjures.  She was a front seat passenger in the car driven by her husband and she was wearing a seatbelt at the time.  The car washit from behind when it was stationary.  The plaintiff dashed forward but was held by the seatbelt.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> After the accident the plaintiff was admitted to the Accident &amp; Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital where the physicalexamination found tenderness over the neck.  The clinical diagnosis was neck sprain.  She was treated and discharged with sick leaveof 4 days.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The plaintiff first consulted Dr Tsoi on 3 October 2003 for her persistent neck, back and left knee pain.  His preliminary diagnosiswas soft tissue sprain injury of neck and back and contusion left knee.  He decided to treat her conservatively by prescribing analgesicsand also arranging for physiotherapy at his clinic.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> He treated her from October 2003 to July 2004.  On 1 December 2003 in view of static progress in his treatment of her an MRI scanof the lumbar spine was performed.  Apart from lumbar scoliosis, very likely caused by muscle spasm, no other abnormality was detected. Based on his physical findings and the MRI report, Dr Tsoi made the clinical diagnosis of musculotendinous strain of left side paraspinalmuscle.  Conservative treatment was adopted.  Despite receiving continuous analgesics and physiotherapy for a few months the plaintiffstill complained of fluctuating low back pain.  Dr Tsoi recommended that she seek psychological advice as he believed that some ofher symptoms were psychosomatic in origin.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Dr Tsoi last saw the plaintiff on 20 July 2004.  She had consulted a psychologist for counseling.  Dr Tsoi advised her to consulta psychiatrist and Dr Chen was recommended to her.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Dr Tsoi concluded that the plaintiff suffered from musculotendinous strain of the left paraspinal muscle of her lower back.  Thesymptoms were magnified by the psychological problems.  He believed that her orthopaedic condition had reached a stage of maximalmedical improvement but that she still required further psychiatric treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Dr Lam in his joint report confirmed that the diagnosis of soft tissue sprain injury of neck and back and contusion left knee wasan appropriate diagnosis and compatible with the mode of the accident.  He agreed also with the conservative treatment given by DrTsoi.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Dr Lamâs assessment was done almost 14 months after the accident and at that time the plaintiff still had multiple complaints. She complained of residual neck pain and stiffness although it had improved a lot after treatment.  On examination of the neck DrLam found tenderness at the midline of the cervical spine.  She had limitation in neck motion in all planes by the pain.  She hadtenderness over both trapezius muscles but no paraspinal muscle spasm.  He said that clinically the neck pain was one of muscularorigin with no features of radiculopathy.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As regards her back pain, Dr Lam said that on examination she still had tenderness at the right upper and left lower lumbar areas. There was tenderness at the midline.  The back motion was limited by pain, particularly in extension.  He said that clinically theback pain was also one of muscular origin with no features of radiculopathy.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Dr Lam agreed with Dr Tsoiâs view that the clinical diagnosis should be musculo-tendinous strain of left side paraspinal muscle,that the symptoms were magnified by the psychological problem and that her orthopaedic condition had reached a stage of maximal medicalimprovement.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> He considered it beneficial for her to try another 2 monthsâ intensive course of orthopaedic and physiotherapy treatment.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The plaintiff was under the care of Dr Chen from 27 July 2004.  She attended Dr Chenâs clinic regularly every fortnightly mostlyoccasionally at three to four weeksâ interval.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In her report Dr Chen deals with the history of mental symptoms, psychiatric treatment and progress as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><strong>â<u>History of Mental Symptoms, Psychiatric Treatment and Progress</u></strong></p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">In October 2003, when she was aware that she has lost the opportunity of promotion, she developed sleeping problem, which had persistedever since.  This was perpetuated by Miss Kâs attitude towards her and the hard time she gave her throughout her office hours. This was the main reason of her being referred by Dr. Danny Tsoi to see me in July 2004.</p>        <p class="quote">My answers to the questions raised in your initial instruction letter are as follows:-</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">1) <u>Diagnosis: <b>Adjustment Disorder, with Anxiety and Depression</b></u></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">This diagnosis was made because of the very close (almost immediate) proximity of onset of symptoms to the stress.  Upset and aggrievedby 1osing her opportunity of promotion, Ms. Cheung developed the following constellation of symptoms:</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  her mood became persistently and consistently low;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she had pressure of worrying thoughts throughout the day;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§ these persisted at bedtime so that she had difficulty in falling asleep, so she requested the prescription of hypnotics from Dr.Tsoi;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§ even if he could fall asleep her sleep was light, she had bad dreams and woke repeatedly throughout the night.  The dreams wereoften about the loss of promotion and gloomy career prospect;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she was unable to concentrate in daytime;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she became more irritable, and became angry easily;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she became tense and nervous;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she had tremor of hands at times;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she lost interest in and was unable to derive pleasure from activities she previously enjoyed, e.g. shopping; dressing up, traveling,karaoke;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she sought relief in indulgence in sweet food, which resulted in weight gain which added to her sorrow;</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Â§  she had reduced interest in sex: she had no sex with her husband for almost six months immediate1y after the accident, and sincethen, had infrequent sex, about once every two months, not for joy, but only out of a wifeâs obligation.  She was haunted withthe underlying fear that sexual activities might aggravate the injury or jeopardize recovery.</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">Owing to the change for the worse of her life circumstances over the past two years, her condition fulfils the criteria of a <b><u>Dysthymic Disorder</u></b>.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> She was prescribed medications namely anxiolytics and anti-depressants.  The reasons given by Dr Chen for prescribing such medicationwere:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(a) poor sleep affecting her concentration power and energy level which affected her performance at work;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(b)    her other symptoms as set out above affected her general functioning and reached a stage where pharmacological interventionwas warranted;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(c)    she was prone to emotional outbursts beyond control;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(d)    in December 2004 she was so depressed that she thought about jumping from height as a suicidal act;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(e) her negative emotions contributed to the aggravation of and delayed recovery from her neck and back pains.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Dr Chen said that with the medication the plaintiffâs sleep improved somewhat, her mood was lifted sufficiently to maintain a fightingspirit and carry on living and also increased her ability to control her emotional outbursts.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> She was of the opinion that the plaintiff would probably need about two more years (from the time of her report) when with supportivepsychotherapy the plaintiff hopefully would come to terms with her adverse life circumstances and find new developments in her career. She was of the view that in her dysthmic mood the plaintiff was suffering from some reduction in efficiency in performing job dutieswhich would improve when she found a job.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> She also opined that all the psychological, behavioural and occupational changes in the plaintiffâs after the accident had affectedthe harmony of the plaintiffâs marital relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Dr Wong examined the plaintiff in January 2007.  He asked her to describe her mood during the first few days after the accident. She told him that she did not feel troubled.  She did not think it was any serious injury.  She told herself that she would nottake much sick leave.  She returned to work two weeks after the accident.  Even on sick leave she often telephoned the office tocheck on progress of a project.  She was keen to get well as soon as she could.  She did not experience any anxiety.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Dr Wongâs mental state examination of the plaintiff and his findings are contained at paragraphs 59 and 60 of his report.  He observedthat the plaintiff was in full contact with reality.  She was genuine, spontaneous and forthcoming.  She did not suffer from anydelusions or hallucinations.  She did not show any psychomotor retardation or agitation.  Her mood was depressed and bitter.  Sheexpressed low self-esteem.  She felt hopeless and helpless about her future.  She clearly expressed that she was unable to let goof her tragic past.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Dr Wongâs psychiatric diagnosis was that she did not suffer from post traumatic stress disorder.  However, after the first twoweeks and despite daily physiotherapy she did not get better.  She started to feel worried.  The catastrophic blow was the loss ofher promotion that happened about one month after the accident.  This loss also shattered her self-esteem and her faith in herself. She was a very success driven person and had not experienced any major setback in life until then.  Starting from November 2003she started to suffer from adjustment disorder with depressed mood.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Dr Wong said that the adjustment disorder with depressed mood deteriorated to become dysthymic disorder sometime in mid 2004.  Thisis a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood together with biological symptoms, in the plaintiffâs case, of insomnia, over-eating,fatigue; cognitive symptoms, in the plaintiffâs case, of poor concentration, impaired thinking and judgment, and other psychologicalsymptoms such as low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness. </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Dr Wong emphasized that he agreed with the diagnosis of Dr Chen.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> He also commented that from the psychiatric angle, it was well recognized that pain was a common concomitant of psychiatric disorders,such as dysthymic disorder.  When the plaintiff was most depressed the pain was also most severe.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Dr Wong opined that the plaintiff was able to return to work as a lawyer but her working capacity was compromised to some extent. The best thing for her was to get back to work.  He was of the view that her prognosis depends on psychiatric treatment and hervoluntary choice to let go of her losses.  He was also of the view that at the end of two more years (from the time of his reportin February 2007) she would no longer suffer from any impairment due to her psychiatric disorder.  He recommended that she continuewith treatment by Dr Chen for two more years.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Main Issue (1)</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Materially contributing cause</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> It is not disputed that the accident was a materially contributing cause for her physical injuries and I so find.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Was the accident a materially contributing cause for her psychiatric illness?  It was submitted on behalf of the defendants thatthe plaintiff has failed to discharge her burden to show that it was.  It is, however, important to bear in mind that the defendantsdo not assert any positive case as to what caused the plaintiff to develop her psychiatric illness.  They simply rely on a failureof the plaintiff to prove that the accident was a materially contributing cause.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The undisputed fact is that before the accident the plaintiff enjoyed good health with no sleep problems or psychiatric problems.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> There is no doubt that the plaintiff was bitterly disappointed at not being promoted and took the news of the promotion of Ms Kwokbadly.  This was, as Dr Wong said, a catastrophic blow to the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> As Dr Chen said, the plaintiffâs mental condition was definitely precipitated by the adverse changes in her career as arrangedby her seniors consequent on her sick leave and health condition caused by the accident.  Dr Chen said that the traffic accidenthad ruined her career. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Dr Wong also said in his report that in order to accurately appraise the psychiatric sequelae of the accident, it was essential tounderstand how the plaintiff perceived the accident and the subsequent chain of events.  The plaintiff felt that she had been veryunfairly treated and was unhappy.  As Dr Wong said, her mood was depressed and bitter.  She expressed low self-esteem.  She felthopeless and helpless about her future.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Dr Wong said that the nature of the accident and the physical trauma directly brought about by the accident appeared to be mild,yet the accident seems to have totally derailed the plaintiff from her previous successful and healthy way of life.  The plaintiffalso said that she hated the accident as it ruined her career and her life.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Taking the medical evidence into account and applying common sense it seems to me that the happening of the accident was a materiallycontributing cause of her psychiatric illness and I so find.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged her burden of showingon a balance of probabilities that the psychiatric illness was also caused by the accident.  The main issue (1) is resolved in theplaintiffâs favour.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Main Issue (2)</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that the plaintiffâs loss of promotion was caused by the physical injuries whereas the loss of her employmentat the PCO was caused by the physical injuries and the psychiatric illness.  It is plain that the psychiatric illness only startedafter the plaintiff learnt in October 2003 that she would not be promoted.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> As the plaintiff said in evidence, joining the PCO led her to a new life.  She became the co-ordinator of international projectsand had opportunities to draft Codes of Practice.  She left private practice deliberately to join the PCO as she felt that she wantedto make a contribution to society in the public sector.  This job gave her satisfaction.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> After Mr Pun left the PCO in March 2003 Ms Kwok was appointed Acting Senior Legal Counsel in April 2003.  Basically, she took overMr Punâs duties.  She was basically supervising the daily operation of the whole Legal Division.  This included supervising theplaintiff.  Ms Kwok said that she was the Acting Senior Legal Counsel for administrative convenience which, as she explained, meantthat when there was a vacancy somebody had to handle the duties.  Ms Kwok remained as Acting Senior Legal Counsel until October 2003when she became the Acting Chief Legal Counsel.  She explained that despite the public recruitment exercise the Commissioner hadnot been able to find a suitable candidate.  As Ms Kwok had less than the required 10 years post-qualification experience for thepost of Chief Legal Counsel at that time, she had to be the Acting Chief Legal Counsel from October 2003 until she attained the requisitepost-qualification experience.  She was appointed Chief Legal Counsel in February 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> It is clear from the appraisal reports of the plaintiff to which I was referred that there was a steady improvement in the plaintiffâswork performance over the years before the accident.  Obviously her immediate superior Mr Pun thought highly of her and the Commissioneragreed with his assessments.   In the appraisal reports prior to the accident, the assessment of her overall performance was improvedfrom âvery effectiveâ to âoutstandingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> In the appraisal report signed by Mr Pun on 31 May 2002 he stated that efforts were being made to increase the spectrum of work ofthe plaintiff. He also praised her for her strengths which included her thoroughness, strong sense of responsibility and keen mind. He also expressed his strong satisfaction with her consistently high standard of her work.  His positive and encouraging appraisalof the plaintiff received the full endorsement of the Commissioner.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> I believe the plaintiff when she said in cross-examination that Mr Pun had once told her that he would recommend her to the Commissionerto be promoted.  This was before writing his appraisal dated 17 May 2003.  It was submitted that she was not reliable in giving thisaccount as it had not been mentioned in chief or in her witness statements or in the accounts given to the doctors.  I have consideredthe criticism of her evidence made on behalf of the defendants.  However, I believe the plaintiff and find that Mr Pun did say toher, as she said in evidence, that he would recommend her for promotion.  </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> It is also important to bear in mind that in the case of the plaintiff Mr Pun specifically stated in his assessment dated 17 May2003 that she was âsuitable for advancementâ.  Mr Pun did not say anything similar in any of the appraisal reports of Ms Kwok. In his said assessment of the plaintiff he also praised her for performing all of her duties with flair and with providing him withinvaluable assistance in the drafting of a code.  He also re-iterated that efforts were being made to increase the spectrum of workof the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> By his assessment dated 19 June 2003 the Commissioner agreed with Mr Punâs assessment of the plaintiff.  He also stated that withbroader experience and a wider spectrum of work, the plaintiff had the potential to make significant contributions to the PCO.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> It seems to me, and I so find, that as part of the efforts that were made to increase the plaintiffâs spectrum of work, in June2003 she was assigned to take up two important international projects namely, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Privacy Project(âAPEC projectâ) and Asia Pacific Telecommunity Privacy Project (âAPT projectâ).  These were in addition to her involvementin an important local project i.e. the revision of the Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The Commissioner also took her along with him instead of Ms Kwok to attend international conferences in Sydney and Melbourne in Australiain September 2003.  This was shortly before the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> I was reminded of the plaintiffâs evidence in cross-examination that the progression of her psychiatric symptoms after October2003 included insomnia, impaired concentration, impaired attention and perhaps impaired memory.  I have considered the defendantsâcriticism of the plaintiffâs evidence.  However, I believe the plaintiff and accept her evidence when she said that the Commissionerintroduced her at the international conferences in Australia in September 2003 as âthe best legal counselâ and âfuture divisionhead of PCOâ.  Either the Commissioner did introduce her as she has described or he did not.  She was in my judgment telling methe truth and her evidence is credible and reliable.  I bear in mind that Dr Wong in his report made it clear that although the plaintiffwas suffering from the psychiatric illness with the symptoms that he and Dr Chen described, the plaintiff was not at any time sufferingfrom any delusions or hallucinations.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> It is also important to bear in mind what the Commissioner told the plaintiff in October 2003.  The details are recorded in the reportof Dr Wong at paragraph 30:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âAbout the same time, in October 2003, one day the Commissioner talked to her in person.  She recalls that conversation:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">âHe talked to me in person. He told me that he looked highly on me and that he and I worked very well together. He said he realizedthat the Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data was a very difficult task and he felt very glad that I did it so successfully. He then said nevertheless he felt very worried about the APEC project and so he had to make a very painful decision.  He told meto get well first and to think of promotion later.  He had decided to promote my junior to become the ActingDivision Head with immediateeffect.â â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> I am satisfied that what she told Dr Wong was true.  Although Ms Kwok was not in fact her junior in the PCO she was, however, herjunior in terms of post qualification practice.  It was plain that the Commissioner regarded the decision to promote Ms Kwok insteadof the plaintiff as a painful decision. </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> It was also submitted on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff confused events and that she was not a reliable witness.  Iam unable to accept the defendantsâ submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> According to Dr Chenâs report the plaintiff informed Dr Chen that she was âimmediately dischargedâ from the APEC project afterthe accident.  In evidence the plaintiff confirmed that she was only relieved of the APEC project and the APT project in late 2003or early 2004 which was what she had told Dr Wong as recorded by him in his report. She said that the Commissioner expressed hisworry about the projects when speaking to her in October 2003 informing her of his âpainful decisionâ.  I do not regard the discrepancyas an important one.  This is a minor discrepancy.  In October 2003 she had been told that she would not be promoted and no doubtshe was bitterly disappointed.  The loss of promotion must have been foremost in her mind at the time.  I am satisfied that the discrepancyas to the sequence of time when she was actually relieved of duties concerning the APEC and APT projects does not affect her credibilityand reliability as a witness.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that it was virtually certain that she would have been promoted.  However, there is no evidence of anydecision having been made by the Commissioner prior to the accident as to Mr Punâs successor.  I am unable to accept that it wasvirtually certain that she would have been promoted.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> It seems to me, and I so find, that the plaintiff had a good chance of being promoted to the post of Chief Legal Counsel but forthe accident.  I have come to this view despite the fact that Ms Kwokâs had more experience than the plaintiff in the PCO and alsohad international exposure at international conferences earlier than the plaintiff.  I regard the fact that the Commissioner hadintroduced the plaintiff as âthe best legal counselâ and the âfuture head of the PCOâ at the international conferences inAustralia in September 2003 as cogent evidence that the plaintiff had a good chance of the promotion ahead of Ms Kwok. </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> As I have found that the Commissioner did speak to the plaintiff in October 2003 in the manner as set out in Dr Wongâs report,it seems to me that quite clearly the Commissioner was worried about the plaintiffâs health.  He told her that he was very worriedabout the APEC project.  He told her to get well first and to think of promotion later.  He told her that he had to make a âpainfuldecisionâ to promote Ms Kwok to become the Acting Division Head with immediate effect.  Although at that time the plaintiff wasexpecting to recover from her physical injuries soon, her physical injuries did cause the Commissioner some concern.  On the evidencethe plaintiff attended Dr Tsoiâs clinic on 14 occasions just in October 2003 as shown in the undisputed Table 1 to Mr Lamâs opening. She returned to work about two weeks after the accident.  She had to attend physiotherapy at Dr Tsoiâs clinic and for this purposeshe had to leave her office early to go over to his clinic in Kowloon.  She was also wearing a neck collar at the time and she haddifficulty in walking according to Ms Kwok.  Although the plaintiff herself considered that she would recover soon from her injuriesit is obvious that the Commissioner did not share this view.  Hence the conversation that he had with her in October 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the physical injuries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident causedher to lose the chance of a promotion which, as I have said, was a good chance.  I am satisfied that the accident caused her to losethat chance.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> There is no dispute that after the onset of her psychiatric illness her condition deteriorated.  Dr Chen has described in detailher mental state and the symptoms she displayed.  There can be no doubt that her work performance was adversely affected.  From thepost-accident appraisal reports after the accident to the time she left the PCO the overall performance deteriorated from âoutstandingâbefore the accident to âeffectiveâ and then to âmoderateâ.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> I was also referred to the plaintiffâs heated written response to Ms Kwokâs appraisal of her after the accident and Ms Kwokâsreply.  It is not necessary to determine whether or not the details of the plaintiffâs complaints were made out.  Needless to say,I accept Ms Kwokâs evidence that her treatment of the plaintiff was fair and considerate in view of the plaintiffâs medical conditionalthough the plaintiff may not have considered that to be so at the time.  The plaintiff was prone to emotional outbursts.  As shesaid, she felt that her temper and patience deteriorated.  She easily got irritated or angry over trivial matters.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> The plaintiff accepted in evidence that she may have been oversensitive and overreacted to the adverse comments of Ms Kwok in theappraisal reports after the accident.  I find that she was probably being oversensitive and had overreacted to Ms Kwokâs commentsand this was as a result of her psychiatric illness.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Her psychiatric illness undoubtedly adversely affected her work performance after the accident.  Not surprisingly, her contract wasnot renewed in June 2006.  I am satisfied that but for the accident there was a good chance that the plaintiffâs contract withthe PCO would have been renewed.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> I would assess the plaintiffâs loss of the chance of promotion and the loss of the chance of renewal of her contract with her PCOto be as high as 70%.  So there will have to be a discount of 30% on the following heads of damages: past loss of earnings and MPFbenefits, loss of congenial employment and future loss of earnings and MPF benefits.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to claim damages under the following heads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1) General damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities (âPSLAâ);</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(2) Past loss of earnings and MPF benefits;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(3) Loss of congenial employment;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(4) Future loss of earnings and MPF benefits;</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(5) Special damages; and</p>        <p style="text-align:left">(6) Future medical expenses.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">PSLA</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The surveillance tape Exh D1 which was introduced in evidence did not provide assistance to me.  The plaintiffâs case is that shewas involved in a relatively minor traffic accident which did not cause her serious physical injuries.  However, she did developpsychiatric illness as a result of injuries in the accident.  It has never been suggested by anyone that her physical injuries andpsychiatric illness were not genuine.  Exh D1 is not particularly helpful.  It does not take matters any further.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The plaintiff was unemployed from June 2006 until May 2007 when she was able to secure employment as an inhouse lawyer with EvergoHoldings Ltd.

She is now the head of the Legal Department earning a salary of $90,000 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> She said in evidence that as she is now employed in her present job she feels much happier.  As a result although she still consultsDr Chen she does so less frequently.  She is expected to continue to need treatment until about February 2009.  Hopefully with theend of this litigation she will be able to let go off her tragic past.  She said that she was willing to follow the recommendationsof Dr Chen and Dr Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> According to Dr Wong the plaintiff should by early 2009 no longer suffer from any impairment due to psychiatric disorder.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> It is also clear on the evidence that after the accident her marital relationship with her husband deteriorated as she had less frequentsexual activities with her husband due to the pain she experienced in her back.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> After the accident she also lost interest in her shopping activities which she used to enjoy before the accident.
