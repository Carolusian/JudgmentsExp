It was not until the second day of the hearing in this Court that it became apparent to us that theAmended Statement of Claim to which the application at first related was the document which appears at P. 3 of the appeal recordbut which bears no indication whatever that it is not the original (unamended) Statement of Claim. We had understood from what wehad been told on the first day that, although the "Amended Statement of Claim" which appears at p.40 of the record had never beenfiled, it was, by consent of the parties, treated in the Court below as having been filed and that it was to that document that thesummons referred. This shows once again that failure to observe the established rules of practice strictly almost invariably resultsin confusion. The true position now appears to have been that the "Amended Statement of Claim" at p.40 (which I shall I hereinafterrefer to as "the draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim) was relied upon only at a later stage in the proceedings before Mayo, J. On18th January 1985 he considered only the document at p.3 and it was that Statement of Claim which he then declined to strike outas he thought it did disclose a cause of action. Counsel for the 7th Defendant reminded the judge that his client had applied forparts of the Statement of Claim to be struck out on the alternative ground that they were embarrassing, and Counsel complained ofpara. 22 in addition to the paragraphs listed in the summons. Counsel for the Plaintiffs having indicated that he would wish to amendthe Statement of Claim, the judge adjourned that aspect of the matter and it was then that the draft Re-Amended Statement of Claimcame into existence. The hearing was resumed on 25th June and the judge proceeded on the assumptions that the Statement of Claimhad been re-amended and that the summons had been amended to include an application to strike out para. 22 of the draft Re-AmendedStatement of Claim.  Since the present appeal is against the decision of 25th June, it is with the draft Re-Amended Statement ofClaim that we are concerned. The appeal record is made even more confusing by the inclusion at p.87 of another "Amended Statementof Claim" which is in fact a draft Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim, but with that we need not concern ourselves.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is common ground that the claim against the 7th Defendant Company ("Katakura") is founded in conspiracy, but objection is takenthat the nature of the conspiracy or conspiracies relied upon does not clearly appear and that, in so far as the overt acts havebeen indicated, they do not justify a claim against this Company.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Before we turn to the pleading as it is now deemed to stand, it is necessary to identify the parties to the action. The 1st Plaintiff(Mr. Wang) is a speculator in Hong Kong in shares of Japanese public limited companies. He is also Chairman, Managing Director andprincipal shareholder in the 2nd Plaintiff, a private limited company incorporated in Hong Kong. The 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs are associatesof Mr. Wang.  Katakura, whose appeal this is, is an old-established Japanese limited company which formerly traded principally insilk but which is now also a land developer. The 1st, 3rd and 5th Defendants are respectively Hong Kong stockbrokers controlled bythe 2nd, 4th and 6th Defendants, which are Japanese stockbrokers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Mr. Wang bought shares in Katakura and persuaded the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs to do the same. They all now allege that they wereinduced to buy their shares as a result of misrepresentations made to Mr. Wang by the 1st, 3rd and 5th Defendants on behalf of the2nd, 4th and 6th Defendants, those misrepresentations being made pursuant to the conspiracy or conspiracies already mentioned.</p>    <p>               </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Paragraph 22 of the draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" class="quote">In or about July or August 1978 the Defendants or some of them with or without others unknown wrongfully and fraudulently conspiredto injure the Plaintiffs or one or more of them by inducing the Plaintiffs or some of them to purchase shares in Katakura and toprocure purchasers for such shares upon the false and fraudulent misrepresentations below mentioned upon a scale and amount for whichpurchasers could or might not otherwise be found in the thin and uncertain market in Katakura shares.  Such representations weremade in circumstances in which to the knowledge of the Defendants or those of them party to the conspiracy, and to the intent ofKatakura, the Plaintiffs who bought shares in Katakura upon the faith of such representations would be unable to buy more than 25per cent in aggregate, under the law mentioned in paragraph 23(12) below. In such circumstances the Plaintiffs would be unable topurchase sufficient shares in Katakura to obtain control of that company and so could not realise the value of the assets on thebasis of which the Plaintiffs were induced to buy shares in Katakura upon the representations aforesaid. The Plaintiffs were andwere intended to be locked into a minority position. The Plaintiffs will at the trial refer to the market price of and turnover inKatakura shares for the period from January 1973 to October 1984 which are set out in Schedule 1 annexed hereto. Having induced thePlaintiffs to make such purchases, they took measures to keep the Plaintiffs' capital locked up and to prevent the Plaintiffs fromdisposing of such shares at all or only at great financial loss. Alternatively, it would be and was the inevitable consequence ofthe Plaintiffs' inability to obtain a controlling interest in Katakura and of the thin and uncertain market in Katakura shares thatthe Plaintiffs would be unable to sell the said shares at all or only at great, financial loss and that the Plaintiffs' capital waslocked up."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>What is required in pleading a conspiracy is a clear statement of the precise tortious agreement which is alleged and then a statementof the overt acts which show that each conspirator was party to that agreement - and, of course, damage to the Plaintiff.  Mr. Hamilton,for the 7th Defendant, points out that the judge began his final decision with the words</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">I am satisfied that the conspiracy or conspiracies referred to in para. 22 are sufficiently described"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>and he reasonably argues that, if the judge did not know whether there was one conspiracy or more, it or they could not have beensufficiently described. The judge had or 18th January thought that the conspiracy originally pleaded was "a continuing conspiracy".At the outset of the appeal we asked Mr. Wright to tell us what he contended was revealed by the new pleading, and he told us thatthere was one conspiracy to cause loss to the Plaintiffs by inducing them by misrepresentations to buy shares and by improper conductthereafter both to prevent them from selling their shares at a reasonable price and from buying more shares so as to enable themto acquire control of the company. I cannot accept that such a conspiracy is readily apparent from para. 2 or even that it is thereto be wrung out from amongst the mass of extraneous matter set out in that paragraph. The plea is so obscure as to place an intolerableburden upon the 7th Defendant and its advisers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Even if that be wrong and the agreement itself is sufficiently pleaded, I think the pleader has failed to allege any overt acts whichwould show that the 7th Defendant was party to the agreement. He purports to allege the overt acts in para. 23, which so far as ismaterial is as follows</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">                The following are particulars of the conspiracy and from which the existence of such conspiracy is to be inferredand the overt acts used to carry the same into effect.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                Early in August 1978 Yamaichi HK on its own behalf and/or on behalf of Yamaichi by Mr. Takahashi the Manager of YamaichiHK without request by Mr. Wang put to Mr. Wang in Hong Kong a trial list ("the List'') of latent profits of Katakura. The List containedparticulars set out in Schedule 2 annexed hereto of properties alleged to be owned by Katakura. The List was supplied by YamaichiHK to Mr. Wang for the purpose of attracting investment in Hong Kong in shares of Katakura.  Alternatively, the List had been suppliedto Yamaichi HK by Yamaichi with the intent that it should be used in Hong Kong to attract investors in Katakura. The List was falsein the respects set in Schedule 3 annexed hereto which falsity was known or ought to have been known to Yamaichi and/or YamaichiHK by reason of the fact that Yamaichi was the underwriter or sole underwriter of the shares of Katakura, by reason of Yamaichi'sconnection with Katakura through Fuji Bank, by reason of Yamaichi's general standing as a stockbroker, by reason of the circumstancesin which the List was given to Mr. Wang and the representations mentioned in the next two following sub-paragraphs were made to Mr.Wang which circumstances are set out in sub-paragraph (11) of this paragraph and by reason of the participation of Yamaichi HK and/orYamaichi in the said conspiracy or for any or more of such reasons.

Yamaichi and Yamaichi HK well knew from previous investment by Mr. Wang in quoted Japanesecompanies that his practice was to buy a huge amount or 10% of the capital of any Japanese company in which he invested, being themaximum individual foreign holding permitted by Japanese law and to recommend friends and associates to buy further shares so thattogether they could exert more influence than they could individually seek.

The information contained in such document was false in the respects set out in Schedule 7 annexed hereto.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(10)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                The representations made by supplying such document in manner aforesaid were made fraudulently knowing them to befalse or recklessly careless whether they were true or false and with the intent that they should be relied upon by prospective investorsin Katakura shares.  Such knowledge or recklessness is to be inferred from Nikko Tokyo's and Nikko's connection with Katakura throughMitsui, from Nikko's general standing as stockbroker, and from the circumstances in which such document was supplied and such representationswere made as set out in the next following sub-paragraph, and from the participation of Nikko in the conspiracy or any one or moreof such reasons.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(11)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                The List and the documents supplied by NKK and Nikko as aforesaid all followed a consistent, cumulative and unusualpattern. Yamaichi HK, NKK and Nikko follow and at all material times followed the usual practice of brokers in Hong Kong by providingprinted or typed bulletins in English upon Japanese investments. Occasionally representatives of each of them would telephone Mr.Wang with particular pieces of advice. The Plaintiffs are unable to give further particulars of any such telephone calls. The Listand each of the said documents were handwritten in Japanese, each depended for its impact upon precise information or misinformationabout properties belonging to or said to belong to Katakura, and in each case the approach was one of urging rather than advisinginvestment. It is to be inferred that the information or source of the information in the List and in each such document was providedby Katakura. The Plaintiffs cannot give further particulars of the source until after Discovery and/or Interrogatories.               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(12)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                Prior to about December 1980 foreigners were not allowed to own in aggregate more than 25% of the equity share capitalof any Japanese company without the consent of the company concerned and of the Japanese Government. In 1978 the Plaintiffs and eachof them expected that such restrictions would be lifted as far as Katakura was concerned in the close foreseeable future. Internationalpressure had by then been brought to bear on the Japanese authorities for some years to remove such restrictions. By Article 2 ofthe supplementary provisions of the amended Japanese Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Act coming into operation in December1980 those restrictions were removed except where their removal would "result in injuring Japan's national security, disturbing themaintenance of its public order or interfering with the preservation of the people's safety; or causing any substantially adverseeffect on the operation of its national economy". The plaintiffs will at the trial refer to the said Act and a translation thereoffor their full terms and effect.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(13)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                The initial list to which such restrictions applied comprised 11 companies.

Four others were companies operating in technical fields,namely Hitachi and Fuji Electric (Defense Industry Nuclear Power), Tokyo Keiki (Aircraft), and Sankyo (Pharmaceutical). The lastwas Katakura. Katakura is the smallest quoted company. It is one of the fear remaining silk spinners in a declining industry of nonational strategic importance. Only one half of Katakura's business is concerned with silk. The decline of the silk industry leftKatakura with large areas of unused land. No Japanese company concerned with land development is on the said list. The inclusionof Katakura on the said list is not justified upon the criteria set out in the said Act.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(14)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                The inference is that Katakura was placed on the said list at the request or instigation of Fuji Bank and/or Mitsuiand/or Katakura or with their consent or acquiescence.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(15)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                The purpose of such inclusion was to prevent the Plaintiffs or any of them from buying further shares in Katakuraso as to obtain control of that company and obtain the benefit of the full value of Katakura's properties notwithstanding that suchproperties and their true value were the foundation of the representations upon which the Plaintiffs and each of them were inducedto buy shares in Katakura.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">xxx</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="12%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(17)</td>            <td width="70%" valign="top" class="quote">In March 1980, Mr. Wang sent his assistant Mr. Lui Wah Lee to attend the annual general meeting of Katakura to be held in Tokyo inMarch 1980 to ask questions and urge the development or realisation of the lands referred to in the List and the said documents.Before such meeting Mr. Lui Wah Lee met Mr. Yanagizawa, a managing director and Mr. Akiyama, a director of Katakura who advised inintimidatory terms not to ask questions or raise difficulties at the annual general meeting. Therefore at such general meeting Mr.Lui refrained from asking questions. The Plaintiffs will at the trial refer to such meetings for their full proceedings.

The fact that a third party publishes information about a company's businessdoes not justify an inference that the company inspired, requested, instigated or connived at the publication, whilst the fact thatthe third party urges rather than advises investment in the company does not assist in fixing the company with involvement in theproduction and distribution of the document. It matters not that the third party may be associated with the company, nor, in my view,does the fact that information was passed in an unusual manner, nor does the fact that it was passed by three stockbrokers at thesame time alter the position. I am not persuaded that the information given was of a nature which could only have been obtained bythe stockbrokers with the privity of the 7th Defendant.   Even less does the inclusion of a company's name in a list of companiesexempted from the operation of a statute suggest, let alone begin to prove, that the company has been guilty of improper pressureupon the legislating authority, whether or not the inclusion of its name is at first sight justifiable. These matters may arousesuspicion, but I do not think they justify the launching of legal proceedings with a view to a fishing expedition for possible evidencewhich might support them. The Court will be slow to drive away a plaintiff before his evidence has been heard, but, where it is clearthat the only evidence he has does not begin to justify the action, it seems to me that the defendant must be protected from beingvexed with proceedings which have no prospect of success.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Hamilton further argues that, even if the pleading were otherwise sufficient, the agreement relied on was not one which had asits predominant purpose the injury of the Plaintiffs: para. 33 expressly states that the overt acts "were perpetrated by the Defendantsand each of them for their own benefit and profit or with the motive of benefiting and profiting themselves in total disregard ofthe in of the Plaintiffs". He relies upon <u>Lonrho Limited v. Shell Petroleum Company Limited (No. 2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1982%20A%20C%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1982 A. C. 173</a>, and in particular upon a passage in the speech of Lord Diplock at p. 189F:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="87%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">I am against extending the scope of civil tort of conspiracy beyond acts done in execution of an agreement entered into by two ormore persons for the purpose not of protecting their own interests but of injuring the interests of the Plaintiff".</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>It is true, of course, that in that case it was conceded that there was no intention to injure the Plaintiffs, so that there was noquestion what was the predominant motive. Mr. Wright here relies upon para. 22 as alleging the motive of the conspiracy, and he saysthat para. 33 was necessary to found a claim for aggravated damages. I do not so read para. 33, and it seems to me that para. 22is as equivocal as much of the rest of the draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim: it says that "the Defendants or some of them" conspiredto injure the Plaintiffs, and, since the "some of them" may not include the 7th Defendant, the Plaintiffs have alleged no cause ofaction against it.  Nevertheless, I accept that para. 22 does allege that the aim of the conspiracy was to injure the Plaintiff,and, if the 7th Defendant were party to the conspiracy, it would be for the trial judge to decide whether that was the predominantmotive. The most that can be said in favour of the Defendants is that the draft Re-Amended Statement of Claim is ambiguous as tothe motive of the conspirators. If that had been the sole objection I would not have struck out any part of the draft pleading.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Although it is not necessary to do so, for the sake of completeness I would express my view on the contention that paras. 14 to 21should have been struck out on the ground that they were irrelevant. Mr. Wright submits that they are relevant as similar facts andthat the rules require them to be pleaded. He says that it is not essential that similar facts should be relied upon as establishinga system. For my part I think that similar facts can rarely be logically relevant unless they do tend to establish a system. Hereit is conceded that the evidence "did not show the same kind of operation", but it is relied upon as showing "that Katakura was preparedto embark on the kind of conduct of which [the Plaintiffs] complain to achieve their purpose". It cannot do that unless it provesthat Katakura had embarked on such conduct before: similar fact evidence is not admissible to show merely that Katakura has brokenthe law. The Plaintiffs endeavour to connect those earlier breaches of the law with the present case by alleging that it is to beinferred from such breaches, and from what Katakura did before and after those breaches, that Katakura had, when committing them,the principal motive of insuring that the two associated companies retained control of Katakura. Then it is said that retention ofcontrol was the ultimate object of what has been described as "the second prong'' of the conspiracy now alleged. As it seems to me,the issue before us is whether the inference which the Plaintiffs seek to draw is, like the other inferences they have relied upon,so manifestly unjustifiable that the facts pleaded in paras. 14 to 21 could not be relevant. I would not have been prepared to holdthat they were necessarily irrelevant, nor do I think it would have been oppressive to admit such evidence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> However, for the reasons given earlier in this judgment I would allow the appeal and strike out the Plaintiffs' claims against the7th Defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Cons, J.

I, too, would strike out the Plaintiffs' claim againstthe 7th Defendant. However, since my Lord has gone on to consider paragraphs 14 to 21 of the Statement of Claim (the "similar facts"allegations) I must respectfully indicate that on this issue, I am not in agreement with him.  When one examines the nature of theconspiracy alleged against the 7th Defendant, and the overt acts pleaded, for my part I find it impossible to hold that the similarfact evidence is "logically probative, that is ..... logically relevant in determining the matter which is in issue" to apply partof Lord Denning's test in <u>Mood Music Publishing Co v. De Wolfe Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20W%20L%20R%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 W. L. R. 451</a>, at p.456. I cannot find a sufficient nexus between the similar facts pleaded and the facts in issue and have reached the conclusionthat they clearly fall on the wrong side of the line. I cannot discern any features in the evidence that paragraphs 14 to 21 wouldpermit to be adduced which provides the necessary link, even when one recognises the distinction, which turns on degrees of relevance,between the application of the "similar fact rule" in civil, as opposed to criminal cases.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> And so, I would have struck out paras. 14 to 21 of the Statement of Claim as "tending to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fairtrial of the action".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Sir Alan Hugging, V.-P.:</strong></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> We are agreed that there should be an order nisi that the Respondents pay the costs here and below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>23rd December 1985</p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>G.
