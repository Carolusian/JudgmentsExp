The defendant is registeredunder Part II of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, Chapter 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong, and part of the Cantor Fitzgerald Incorporated Group of Companies, a firm of brokers operatingon various bond markets around the world. It closed its business in Hong Kong on 17 March, 1988. The contracts of the plaintiffswere terminated, and they were told that they would receive salary until the end of April, 1988. However, the employment contractsmade no provision for early termination, and the defendant has not offered compensation or other employment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that the claims fall within the ambit of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, Chapter 25, which reads as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"7.

(as he then was), who felt that "Practically every case involving a breach of service agreement gives riseto a claim for unliquidated damages (<u>Yip Wan-chiu v. Magnificent Industrial Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20HKLR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] HKLR 183)".</a> He went on, at page 278:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The phrase 'sum of money' must be construed in the light of the fact that practically every claim for 'breach of a term.....of acontract' will be for damages unliquidated in law but quantified in practice. It follows that the phrase must cover such claims.I agree with Roberts, C.J. that the legislature anticipated a 'quantified' claim and a claim that was 'ascertained' or ascertainable.But I regret that I cannot agree that this makes the claim one for liquidated damages, or that it limits the tribunal's jurisdictionto such claims. This conclusion seems to me to be supported by paragraph 3 (of the Schedule). No claim 'founded in tort' can be forliquidated damages. It may contain a calculated or special damages element; but the bulk is likely to be for general damages. I ammuch comforted to know that the same conclusion was reached by O'Connor, J. on 18th December 1979 in <u>Steward and Others v. The Hong Kong Philharmonic Society Limited</u> (H.C. Civil Action No. 3031/79). Unfortunately as this decision was not reported, it was not cited to Roberts, C.J."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Having reasoned in this way, Hunter, J. at p. 278 felt "constrained by the rigidity of the ordinance to make orders quite contraryto the merits of the case."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In other words, Hunter, J. decided that a claim for a "sum of money" was not necessarily a claim for liquidated damages, but couldinclude a claim for unliquidated damages. He was thus in diametric opposition to Roberts, C.J. in <u>National Ebauch Ltd. and Rishi Kaumar Bhatnagar</u> <sup>(2)</sup>, who concluded "that a claim for a sum of money arising from a breach of contract, does not include a claim for unliquidated damages".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Hunter, J. derived support from the unreported decision of O'Connor, J. in <u>The Hong Kong Philharmonic Society</u> case. O'Connor, J. there pointed out that the phrase "sum of money" was clearly envisaged by paragraph 3 of the schedule to includea claim for unliquidated damages, for since all claims in tort are for unliquidated damages, the paragraph, in effect, concedes thata claim for a sum of money can arise in a cause of action founded in tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Smith, on behalf of the plaintiffs, submitted that Hunter, J. was clearly wrong. He submitted that the phrase "sum of money"carried a clear and unambiguous meaning. It did not have to be a liquidated sum, as such, in the sense that "liquidated damages"is an agreed pre-estimate of damage in the event of a breach. It merely had to be a claim for any sum of money. He pointed to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>, which requires a claim to contain, inter alia, the "sum of money claimed by each claimant or person represented", and also"such particulars of the claim as shall be reasonably sufficient to inform the defendant of the grounds for the claim and of themanner in which the amount claimed by each claimant or person represented has been calculated", as reinforcing his argument.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> He submitted that the plaintiffs' claims were not for a specific "sum of money" in the ordinary meaning of that expression, althoughobviously they were asking for monetary damages. But the amount awarded, if the plaintiffs were successful, would depend on manyimponderables, and was not quantifiable in advance. In other words, he was submitting that a claim for a sum of money does not includea claim for unlimited unliquidated damages. (Roberts, C.J. in <u>National Ebauch</u> had held that it does not include <u>any</u> unliquidated damages.)</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Smith referred to <u>Hung Sang Engineering Works Limited and Yu Wing Fat</u> <sup>(3)</sup>, a decision of the Full Court of Hong Kong. The respondent there brought a claim against the appellant in the Labour Tribunal, claimingwrongful dismissal from his position of apprentice and claiming $338, being one month's wages in lieu of notice. The President transferredthe matter to the District Court on the ground that he considered it was a case where the respondent could claim unliquidated damagesfor the remaining period of his apprenticeship. Judgment was eventually given for $6,000 in favour of the respondent as general damagefor wrongful dismissal.  The appellant appealed to the Full Court, the appeal was allowed, and a new trial in the District Courtwas ordered for the purpose of assessing damages arising out of the wrongful dismissal of the respondent. (Briggs, C.J. dissenting).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The issues argued at the appeal are of no relevance to the present case, but Huggins, J. (as he then was) said at p. 400:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is therefore the proceeding between the claimant and the defendant which may be transferred under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 10</a> and we must construe the order of transfer accordingly. But what was the proceeding between the Respondent and the Appellants whichwas transferred" According to the Form of Claim as I have interpreted it, it was a proceeding for the recovery of unliquidated damagesfor breach of a contract of apprenticeship limited to $338. ...... In my view the presiding officer was right in thinking that therewas no unlimited claim to unliquidated damages before him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Unless I have misunderstood him, Mr. Smith submitted that this was an implicit recognition by Huggins, J. that while aclaim for aspecificsum of money could properly be described as unliquidated damages, and correctly brought in the Labour Tribunal, a claim for unlimitedliquidated damages should be transferred to the District Court, or the High Court.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>                (It would seem that the claim in <u>Hung Sang Engineering</u> would have been regarded by Roberts, C.J. as having been incorrectly brought in the Labour Tribunal, for his conclusion in <u>National Ebauch</u> was that âa claim for a sum of money arising from a breach of contract does not include a claim for unliquidated damages", andHuggins, J. described the claim as an unliquidated one for a limited sum.)</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Faulkner submitted that following the decision in <u>Colchester Estates v. Carlton Industries</u> <sup>(4)</sup>, I, as the third Judge, should follow the second Judge, namely Hunter, J., who, having fully considered the decision of Roberts,C.J., the first Judge, came to a very different conclusion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Smith, whilst acknowledging the correctness of this principle, submitted nevertheless that this was that rare case where thesecond Judge has been clearly wrong in not following the first, and that I should therefore follow the first Judge, namely Roberts,C.J. he submitted that <u>Hung Sang Engineering</u> was not cited to either Judge, and that it was both a binding and persuasive authority.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In my view <u>Hung Sang Engineering</u> is quite clearly not a binding or persuasive authority for the proposition that a claim for damages arising from a breach or contractis not a claim for a sum of money within the Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>. It is perhaps, possible to infer that Huggins, J. considered thata limited claim for unliquidated damages had been correctly brought in the Labour Tribunal, and that there was nothing wrong, assuch, for the transfer to the District Court of an unlimited claim for unliquidated damages. But I find it impossible to concludethat Huggins, J. decided that an unlimited claim for unliquidated damages had to be transferred out of the Labour Tribunal. The factis that Huggins, J. was concerned with entirely different issues, and nothing that he said can be regarded as a binding or persuasiveauthority in relation to the issue upon which Roberts, C.J. and Hunter, J. specifically ruled.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the decision of Hunter, J. was reached after full and careful consideration of thedecision of Roberts, C.J., and I therefore propose to follow and apply it in this case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It would be inappropriate for me to empress my own views of the matter in any detail, and it will no doubt be determined by the Courtof Appeal. I only wish to say that it seems likely that the difficult and ambiguous phrase, "sum of money" may well have been usedto highlight the distinction between any monetary claim whatsoever, arising from the breach of a contract of employment, be it aclaim for liquidated damages, or unliquidated damages, limited or unlimited, on the one hand, and any non-monetary claim, on theother.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The plaintiffs claim is therefore struck out, as in their application to join two additional plaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> There remains the plaintiffs' application to continue the injunction, and the derendant's application to have it discharged.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr. Faulkner submitted that <u>Siskina and Distos Compania Naviera B.A.</u> <sup>(5)</sup> was authority for the proposition that if the Court was held to have no jurisdiction to hear a matter, it also had no jurisdictionto grant an injunction, or to continue an injunction already granted.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In my view, It is authority for nothing of the kind. In that case it was held that the injunction sought in the action had to bepart of the substantive relief to which the plaintiffs' cause of action entitled them; and the thing that it was sought to restrainthe foreign defendant from doing in England had to amount to an invasion of some legal or equitable right belonging to the plaintiffsin England and enforceable by a final judgment for an injunction; t hat in the <u>Siskina</u> the plaintiffs had no equitable right or interest in certain insurance moneys which had been paid to the defendant by insurers inEngland, in respect of the loss of a vessel; for all that they had was a claim to compensation arising from a cause of action againstthe defendant which could not be brought in England without the defendant's consent, which such consent had not been given, and thatnotice of the writ should be set aside as not falling within Order 11, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 1(1)(i)./</a></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Order 29 l.(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court permits the grant of an injunction to any party to a cause or matter, and Order29 i.(3) prohibits such an application before the issue of the writ or originating summons by which the cause or matter is to bebegun except where the case is one of urgency, and in that case the injunction applied for may be granted on terms providing forthe issue of the writ or summons and such other terms, if any, as the Court thinks fit.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Since I have struck out the plaintiffs' action, I propose to treat their application for a continuation of the injunction as an applicationfor an injunction made before the issue of a writ, in a case involving some urgency. I say that because it is obvious that if therestraint on dealing with its assets was to be lifted, the defendant could forthwith remove them from the jurisdiction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> It follows that I regard proceedings in the Labour Tribunal to be a "cause or matter".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> There is no power in the Labour Tribunal, so far as 1 can ascertain, to grant an injunction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It is inconceivable that parties to a dispute in the Labour Tribunal should not have the protection afforded by an injunction torestrain the removal of assets out of the jurisdiction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I therefore order as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="98%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="114" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="114" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="84%" height="114">                That the Defendant whether acting by itself its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever be restrained until furtherorder from removing any of its assets save as to any excess over hk$600,000 out of the jurisdiction of this Court or from disposingof, charging, transferring out, or otherwise in any way dealing with or dissipating all or any of such assets.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="55" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="55" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="84%" height="55">                That the plaintiffs file claims with the Registrar of the Labour Tribunal within 14 days of this date.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="61" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="61" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="84%" height="61">                That there be liberty to apply to set aside or vary the terms of  this order and the date for any such applicationto set aside or vary the terms of this order be fixed in consultation with all the parties involved.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="53" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="53" valign="top">(4)</td>            <td width="84%" height="53">                That the plaintiffs case be struck out with costs (excluding any costs associated with the injunction) of the applicationand the action to the defendant.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="45" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="45" valign="top">(5)</td>            <td width="84%" height="45">                That the plaintiffs application to join two additional defendants be struck out with costs to the defendant.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="64" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="64" valign="top">(6)</td>            <td width="84%" height="64">                That the defendant's application to discharge the order of Garcia J. made on the 19th day of March 1988 be refusedwith costs reserved.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="48" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="48" valign="top">(7)</td>            <td width="84%" height="48">                That the costs of the plaintiffs' application to continue the injunction ordered by Garcia, J. on 19th day of March1988 be reserved.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="7" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="7" valign="top">(8)</td>            <td width="84%" height="7">                That both parties have leave to appeal.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" align="left" height="24" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" align="left" height="24" valign="top">(9)</td>            <td width="84%" height="24">That in the event of an appeal by the plaintiffs against the order to strike out the action, the order requiring the plaintiffs tofile claims in the Labour Tribunal be stayed</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(M.S.
