The Plaintiff claimed for damagesin the total sum of HK$228,000.00 and his cause of action was that of tort of nuisance and/or breach of Deed of Mutual Covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Plaintiff is at all material times the registered owner of Unit 3, 3/F Shun Fat Industrial Building, 17 Wang Hoi Road, KowloonBay, Kowloon. (âthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premisesâ), whereas the Defendants the registered owners of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises directly above the Plaintiffâs.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The issues before me, like in most other similar cases, are simply what caused the water seepage and whether it came from the Defendantsâ4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises. If the Defendants were responsible for the water seepage, then what were the damages suffered by the Plaintiff, ifany.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  There was complaint concerning water seepage onto the Plaintiffâs 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises and as a result on or about 31<sup>st</sup> October 2006 (or according Mr. S.T. Wong the registered structural engineer who attended the inspection the date was 1<sup>st</sup> November 2006), a joint inspection took place at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises to inspect the defective floor slab (at toilet area) at the ceiling of 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor. The exact date of the inspection does not really matter. There were also photographs taken as to the condition thereat. Mr.Wong had this to say :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPlease be advised that the slab is under going serious deterioration. Serious corroded steel reinforcing bars and spalled concretehave been found; some steel reinforcing steel bars are even brokenâ¦.</p>        <p class="quote">âThe aforesaid defective slab must be properly repaired and strengthened immediately in order to prevent the floor from collapse.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Thus, it was a warning from a professional structural engineer that the ceiling of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor was in serious deterioration and that it had to be repaired, otherwise the ceiling might even collapsed.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendants were quick to respond. The letter from S.T.Wong &amp; Partners Ltd. did not reveal any cause nor did it say thatany water seepage came from the Defendantsâ 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises onto the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises. Mr. Tung the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIâd recommend you to provide proper documents to prove officially the share of responsibilities of the subject matter as soonas possible. Should the proper documents be ready, please fax to [no.], I will then evaluate and take appropriate course actionsaccordingly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendants did not reject the Plaintiffâs claim out of hand, and to be fair to them, they asked for evidence that they wereresponsible.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On the other hand, on 13<sup>th</sup> November 2006, the Plaintiff instructed solicitors to issue a letter before action and demanded HK$70,000.00 as the estimate of costsof repair of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises and also demanded maintenance works to be done at the Defendantsâ premises. No doubt by threatening legal action,it did not enhance cordial neighbourhood relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Meanwhile, on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2006, the managing company Hang Yick Properties Management Ltd. carried out a special check for the common used drainagepipe and water pipe by their technical staff and found that <i>âthere was no any leakage or seepage from the common used pipe.â</i> This information was related to the Defendants on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 20<sup>th</sup> November 2006, S.T. Wong &amp; Partners Ltd. wrote another letter dealing with the cause of the water seepage addressed to the Plaintiff.Mr. Wong said this :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPlease be advised that the slab is under going serious deterioration due to water leakage/seepage from floor above. Serious corrodedsteel reinforcing bars and spalled concrete have been found, some steel reinforcing steel bars are even broken.</p>        <p class="quote">âThe aforesaid defective slab must be properly repaired and strengthened immediately in order to prevent the floor from collapse.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  This letter tried to address the Defendantsâ concern as to evidence or proof that the water seepage problem was originating fromtheir 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises. However, the Defendants in a letter also dated 20<sup>th</sup> November 2006 still insisted that <i>âprofessional documents to verify the share of responsibilities of the subject matter should be properly prepared and submitted,should you need any assistance from my end. I will then evaluate the case accordingly</i>.â</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Thus, it can be seen that the Defendants were still not accepting any responsibility. Nor were they convinced by this latest letterof Mr. S.T.Wong as to the cause of water seepage. As to what the Defendants required by way of âprofessional documentsâ, theydid not specify. Thereafter, government departments became involved.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 5<sup>th</sup> December 2006, the Joint Office of Building Department and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department went to the premises to carryout a colour pigment test but they could not identify the cause at that time. However, the department promised to do further testingin future.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 5<sup>th</sup> February 2007, the department sent some staff to carry out a ponding water test on the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor of female toilet. In a letter dated 13<sup>th</sup> April 2007, it said that <i>âthe test revealed that the source of water seepage at the ceiling of Unit 3 on 3/F should be defective water-proofing materialon the floor of toilet. In this regard, we have informed you and the complainant of the identified source of water seepage on 14<sup>th</sup> February 2007.â</i> The letter also recorded that a Nuisance Notice was issued to the Defendants on 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2007 requiring them to repair satisfactorily the toilet at your premises by providing proper water-proofing material to preventwater seepage to Unit 3 on 3/F.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Pausing here and by this juncture, it must seem to any reasonably objective bystander that the evidence was quite conclusive. Mr.Lawrence Cheung for the Defendants has done a remarkable job in attempting to persuade me that there must have been some doubt asto the cause of the water seepage since the first letter of S.T.Wong did not specify the cause came from the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises, the first test by the government department could not identify the cause and that if there had been any problem ithad nothing to do with the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  There are the attacks on phrases used, for example âwater dripping downâ which was not seen by the structural engineer and thatMr. Wong was not in any position to comment on water seepage since he was only a structural engineer and that as I have mentionedalready in the first inspection by the government departments staff no cause could be identified, let alone the fact that water seepagecame from the Defendantsâ premises. I have considered all those and other points taken by Mr. Cheung in this aspect.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Realistically, water is elusive. Different tests have to be taken and once it was confirmed that there was no leakage from the commonpipes adjacent or in-between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises, it is difficult to see where else could the water have originated from. Of course, there would be some cases wherethe true cause could not be found. Further, I note that there was no expert report on the side of the Defendants to point to othercauses for water seepage other than from their 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises. When that being the case, I am left with the government staff pointing to the cause being from the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises, even if I were to disbelieve Mr. S.T.Wong, which I have no valid reason to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In addition, the evidence of Mr. Tung of the Defendants who also pointed to some water on the toilet floor of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises at different times. Of course, Mr. Tung insisted that such water as there was present did not cause any problem. ButI am not convinced. I have no doubt and I do find that the water seepage did come from the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises and onto the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises causing damages thereat.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  That is not the end of the story here.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Defendants also dispute the quantum and said that the Plaintiffâs claim for damages were exaggerated, excessive and he failedto mitigate the losses.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  At the earliest stage of cross-examination by Mr. Lawrence Cheung for the Defendants, the Plaintiff withdrew his claim for the rentallosses (for the sum of HK$105,000.00), once it turned out that the Plaintiffâs claim here could not really stand. The reason being,as it was rightly pointed out by Mr. Cheung for the Defendants that, the original sitting tenantâs monthly rental was less thanthe new tenant and thus begs the question how could the Plaintiff managed the increased rental of HK$35,000.00 per month suddenlyand that Lap Kei Engineering Company Ltd. (âLap Keiâ) was in fact controlled by the Plaintiff. After the Plaintiff abandons hisrental claim, then, it begs the question as to whether the rest of the Plaintiffâs claim i.e. the HK$120,000.00 repair costs byKa Tai Decoration Engineering Co. (âKa Taiâ) and HK$3,000.00 being the costs of ST Wongâs expert report also stands.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendants also counterclaim for a sum of HK$168,000.00 as damages suffered for reduced rental from their tenants due to thetrouble and nuisance caused as a result of this water problem. The Defendants also claimed that the delay/conduct of the Plaintiffcontributed to increase of the renovation costs in the sum of HK$45,000.00. In other words, if repair could have been carried outearlier, it would have cost much less than what the Defendants eventually paid.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In short, firstly I have to ask myself whether the Plaintiff having lost his credibility on nearly half of his original claim affectsthe remainder of his claim.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  For that, I have to examine the Plaintiffâs claim here.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For the HK$3,000 paid to ST Wong &amp; Partners Ltd., I see there is an invoice in the file that the money was paid by Lap Kei toST Wong &amp; Partners Ltd. It is already established that Lap Kei was a company controlled by the Plaintiff. It is not surprisingthat it was Lap Kei who paid since the letters from ST Wong &amp; Partners Ltd. were all addressed to Lap Kei and I have heard evidencethat the water seepage problem was dealt with by the Plaintiffâs manager Mr. Leung from Lap Kei. I have no reason to doubt thatevidence. Thus, I find that the Plaintiff did pay the sum of HK$3,000.00 which was a direct loss arising from the water seepage problem.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Then the Plaintiff claims the costs of rectification in the sum of HK$120,000.00. It arises from an invoice of Ka Tai dated 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2008. It only gave a total figure in the sum of HK$120,000.00. The description on this invoice is far from adequate. Thereis paucity of information such as breakdown as to how much each type/unit of construction works cost and the detail of what did itinvolve, or for that matter the payment terms and any deposits so on which are usually apparent on any such quotations or invoices.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Then, I have to contrast the amount of repair costs eventually paid by the Defendants which only amounted to some HK$51,500.00 fromone Shun Ming Construction Co. Ltd.. There seems to be some dispute between the Defendants and their contractors as to quality ofworks and the Defendants have not paid them in full yet. From Exhibit D2, only HK$46,350.00 was paid. Of course, the two differentpremises and their works to be undertaken would not be the same. The areas would be different and the extent would also vary, especiallywhen I see the photographs of the damage to the ceiling of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises. Thus, the costs of the Defendants could only be a reference point and no more than that.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Nonetheless, I see that there were receipts from Ka Tai for cash payments made by the Plaintiff respectively for HK$50,000.00 on3<sup>rd</sup> January 2008, HK$35,000.00 on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2008 and HK$35,000.00 on 28<sup>th</sup> February 2008 in relation to the works done. In absence of any other cogent evidence to the contrary, I am not prepared to simplyreject these receipts which would signify some bigger conspiracy. Nor do I have some other independent evidence to say that the sumwas totally out of normal proportion.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I remind myself that the standard is only on balance of probabilities and as a result, I find that this sum of HK$120,000.00 provenand I allow this sum.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I now turn to the Defendantsâ counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I first deal with the increase in renovation costs as claimed by the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The Defendants point to some conduct of the Plaintiff, for example his solicitors threatening injunction to enter the Defendantsâpremises for repair works to be done and then during the Defendantsâ renovations threatening injunction to stop them. Such wasthe reason for the delay and subsequent increase in renovation costs.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  However, all such matters happened because parties sadly could not work in harmony. When the Defendants started renovation on top,slabs fell from the ceiling in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor premises. It had to stop to prevent injury. Of course, thing would have turned out differently, if both parties carried outtheir renovations and repair works at the same time. That could not be achieved. But I do not find the conduct/delay caused the increasein renovation costs.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  When I compare the two quotations (the original and the increased costs), they covered somewhat different works. In addition, thecosts of HK$51,500.00 from Shun Ming was quite reasonable. Thus, I reject this counterclaim by the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Insofar as the reduction of rental claim by the Defendants, it is really quite incredible. What the Defendants are saying is simplysince there were so much trouble to the tenant, they agreed with the tenant a reduction from the market rate of HK$35,000.00 to HK$28,000.00for a period of 24 months for 15<sup>th</sup> November 2007 to 14<sup>th</sup> November 2009; making it a total loss of HK$168,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I have no hesitation in rejecting this claim. Firstly, the Defendantsâ stance throughout was that there was no problem in thetoilet area of the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor premises. If there was, it was only a slight one. If that was their case from the outset and maintained at trial throughout,then, the reduction of rent had nothing to do with the nuisance. Secondly, I can well understand some reduction for any trouble causedduring the renovation period or before, but not for an extra two years after all was well and repaired. That must be stretching theimagination too much. For these reasons, I also reject this counterclaim of HK$168,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As a result, I enter judgment for the Plaintiff for the sum of HK$123,000.00 (being HK$120,000.00 + HK$3,000.00). As to costs, Imake an order nisi for the allowance of half of the Plaintiffâs costs only with certificate for counsel, as nearly half of hisclaim failed. At the same time, I dismissed the Defendantsâ Counterclaim. The interests of the sum of HK$123,000.00 at half ofjudgment rate from the date of writ to date of judgment and at full judgment rate thereafter until payment. Needless to say, I thankboth counsel for their comprehensive and excellent work and assistance in this matter.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">( Osmond Lam )</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>The Plaintiff : represented by Mr. Lam Chin Ching Gary instructed by Messrs.
