In the court below it was in issue whether the application to the judge was properly made by summons, and itwas held that it was - by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s200.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.200(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> The point has not been pursued upon the appeal, so that we have heard no argument upon it. Nevertheless I wish to express my doubtwhether the "directions" contemplated by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s200.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.200(3)</a> were intended to encompass anything more than directions as to the conduct of the proceedings. Had the application been by OriginatingSummons not only might other interested parties have had notice of it but we should have had evidence before us on a number of relevantmatters. As it is, we are told that the official Receiver has received notice of claims against one or more of the companies fromthird parties who say that they are entitled to demand unliquidated damages from the companies by reason of the existence of policiesof compulsory insurance taken out by divers owners of motor vehicles and employers. We are asked to assume that each of the companiesis insolvent, and it is common ground that the material date for ascertaining whether a debt may be proved in a winding up is thedate of the winding-up order.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Jones, J. in a careful judgment decided that unliquidated claims brought pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> could properly be proved, but that claims under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance</a> could not. The Attorney General appeals on behalf of the Director of Social Welfare in respect of the claims under the latter Ordinance,the Director being interested by reason of the new Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme, under which the third parties maybe granted compensation from the Director if they do not recover it from the insured owners or from the companies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Any right to claim in the winding-up stems from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s264.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.264</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="18%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="68%" class="quote">In the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to the respective rights of securedand unsecured creditors and to debts provable and to the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities as are in forcefor the time being under the law of bankruptcy with respect to the estates of persons adjudged bankrupt, and all persons who in anysuch case would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the assets of the company may come in under the winding up,and make such claims, against the company as they respectively are entitled to by virtue of this section."</td>            <td width="14%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>We therefore have to turn to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>.

That might be material, because the vital words appearin sub-s.(1), namely "demands arising by reason of a contract".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> First we have to consider what is the nature of the demands against the companies which are here in issue. Clearly there was no privityof contract between the third party claimants and the insurance companies: those contracts were made by the insurers with the insured.But for the statute the third parties could have no right to proceed against the insurers. However, the protection which the Legislatureintended to afford to third party victims of traffic accidents by imposing on users of motor vehicles an obligation to insure againstthird party risks could only be fully effective if a direct right of action against the insurers were conferred. As I understandit, third party claims must be brought under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1).</a> The only other provision in the Ordinance which gives a right of indemnity, is <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(2)</a>, but (in so far as it is concerned with rights rather than liabilities) that is concerned with the right of a "person specified inthe policy" other than the insured himself to claim in his own name against an insurer. Such persons would have no privity of contractand at Common Law would have no right to sue under the policy for an indemnity if a third party claim were made against him. Theeffect of the equivalent English provision (s.36(4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1930) was discussed in <u>Guardian Assurance Co. Ltd.</u> v <u>Sutherland</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1939%202%20All%20ER%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1939 2 All E.R 246</a>, a case concerned with the right of an insurer to avoid a policy issued in reliance upon representations which were shown to havebeen false. In the course of his judgment Branson, J. said of s.36(4) at p. 250D :</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="18%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="68%" class="quote">The section does not, in my opinion, impose any statutory liability upon the insurer. It only gives to 'persons specified' a statutoryright, which, apart from statute they did not possess, to sue upon the contract. This is on all fours with the right given by theThird Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act, 1930, to third parties in the event of bankruptcy or winding up of persons insured,and the rights given by the Road Traffic Act, 1934, s.10, to persons who have recovered judgment against persons insured."</td>            <td width="14%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>Section 10(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1934 is in the same terms as s.10(1) of the Motor Vehicle Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinanceand accordingly it is argued that the right given by the latter provision is on all fours with that given by s.36(4) of the RoadTraffic Act 1930, namely a statutory right to sue the insurer where the third party has obtained a judgment against any person insuredby the policy, that is to say against the policy holder or against any other "person specified in the policy". Mr. Smith fairly pointsout that Branson, J. was not concerned with s.10(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1934, and there is an obvious distinction (whether materialor not) between conferring a right to sue upon a contract and conferring a right to sue upon a judgment given in an action upon thecontract. We have, of course, no evidence before us that judgments have been obtained in the present case against the persons protectedby the relevant policies or, if they have, whether they were judgments for damages which have been assessed or for damages whichhave yet to be assessed. Only in the latter case would the demands against the companies under s.10 be for liquidated damages. Itis not disputed that such judgments would be based upon a claim in tort and would be against the Defendants as tortfeasors and notas parties to a contract. It is argued that the third parties would have no right to sue under the statute were the companies not"insurers" by virtue of the contracts, and that cannot be gainsaid. Is it enough to justify holding that the demands arose "by reasonof" the contracts? Undoubtedly the contracts were a sine qua non for liability, but the liability itself arose under the statute.On behalf of the Attorney General it is urged that, if the contracts were a sine qua non for liability, they were necessarily a reasonfor the demands, even if the liability did not arise under the contracts but under the statute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Mr. Tong seeks to support his argument by reference to the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a>, which is said to be in pari materia. Jones, J. took the view that the wording of the two statutes was sufficiently different toforce upon him the distinction which he made between them, and at least at first sight there is ground for that view: the schemeof the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> is clearly to make statutory amendments to those contracts of employment to which it relates, with the result that the right of aworkman to sue his master's insurer directly is a right which arises under the contract itself. Thus <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.43(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">44</a> provide:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="18%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="68%" class="quote">                43(1). Subject to this section, where in relation to an employee there is in force a policy of insurance for thepurposes of this Part and the employer of the employee becomes liable to pay any sum under this Ordinance or independently of thisOrdinance in respect of an injury to the employee arising out of and in the course of his employment, such sum shall forthwith becomedue and payable by the insurer, including any sum payable in respect of interest and costs, notwithstanding anything to the contraryin the policy of insurance."                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="14%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="18%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="68%" class="quote">44. Every policy of insurance issued for the purposes of this Part shall be deemed to provide that any employee or other person havinga claim against the person insured in respect of the liability in regard to which such policy was issued shall be entitled to recoverin his own name, as though he were a party to the policy, directly from the insurer any amount "Which he would have been entitledto recover from the person insured."</td>            <td width="14%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>What one then has to ask is this, If the third party were a party to the policy, what would be the nature of his claim against theinsurer?  The parties are not ad idem as to the answer to that question, for the Respondent submits that the liability of the insurerarises under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s .44</a> whereas the Appellant contends that the insurer's liability arises under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(1)</a> and that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.44</a> merely provides machinery for giving effect to a claim under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43(1).</a> For my <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> do not think anything turns upon this. It seems to me that the sections are to be read together, but the effect is that the statuteoperates to give the third party - by virtue of the statutory fiction that the third party was a party to the contract - a rightto sue under the contract for the indemnity to which the insured would have been entitled under the policy. That right would notexist but for the statute, but it must, none the less, be deemed to be a contractual right, and any unliquidated demand by the thirdparty would clearly be within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>. Therefore, Mr. Tong argues, the case under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance</a> should similarly be regarded as falling within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>: in neither case would liability exist in the absence of the statute or in the absence of the contract. He goes on to point out theanomalies which would arise if the judge were right in distinguishing between the two cases. One example he gives is that of a workmaninjured in a traffic accident in the course of his employment through the negligence of a stranger. The risk of such injury is onewhich must be covered by compulsory employees' compensation insurance: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.40.</a> In respect of the same injury the workman might be able to prove in the winding up of the master's insurers by virtue of the provisionsof the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> but could not prove in the winding up by virtue of the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance</a>, although similar protection was aimed at by both pieces of legislation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In my judgment the fallacy in this argument on behalf of the Appellant is the treating of these statutes as in pari meteria: theydo not deal with the same subject matter but with different subject matters in a comparable way. In no sense do they form a systemor code of legislation. They must therefore be construed independently.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Similarly I find no assistance from the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/273" class="autolink_findacts">Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Ordinance</a>, although it could properly be considered as in pari materia with the Motor Vehicle Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance. Section2 of the former statute is concerned with cases where it is the insured who becomes bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangementwith the creditors. In such circumstances the insured's rights against the insurer "under the contract" are "transferred to and vestin the third party". That being so, the third party acquires a right which is clearly to be regarded as contractual in nature althoughconferred by statute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> We must in the end come back to the words of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a> and give them their normal meaning. To be provable, the demands must have arisen "by reason of a contract". It is the old problemof causation in one of its many contexts. Put in another way the question is whether the contracts which the Legislature had in mindwere necessarily contracts to which the third party was, or by statute was deemed to be, a party. Mr. Smith in effect submits thatthey were, and he bases his contention on the fact that before the Bankruptcy Act, 1869 no unliquidated claims were provable; itwas in that statute that the present s.34(1) originated; it was the object of the Legislature to allow proof of a demand where thebankrupt had personally promised to undertake a liability to the claimant; here there was no such promise, either in fact or in legalfiction; as this provision became law before the Judicature Acts, the old rules of pleading were in force; therefore it was necessaryto bring the claims within one of the recognized forms of action; the claims in question would necessarily have been pleaded as actionson the statute and not in assumpsit. As I see it, in a claim under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/272" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance</a>, whilst the contract constitutes a less important element than in a claim under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.43</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> or under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/273/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/273" class="autolink_findacts">Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Ordinance</a>, it is still a vital element: the claim cannot be (and never could have been) pleaded without alleging the contract. I am not persuadedthat the words "arising by reason of a contract" were related to the old form of action in the manner suggested. Again, <u>Harvey</u> v <u>R.G. O'Dell Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%202%20QB%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 2 Q.B. 78</a> is of no assistance. There it was held that an action for contribution under s.6 of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tort feasors)Act, 1935 was not a proceeding "in respect of a cause of action in tort".

Indeed, an employed driver could so prove for damagesfor injury sustained in the course of his employment and as a result of the use of a motor vehicle on a road. But the markedly differentlanguage found in sections 9 and 10 of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance cannot be overlooked or strained in an effort to obviate anomalieswhich are inevitable in the light of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s263.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 263</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s264.html" class="autolink_findacts">264</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, or to achieve consistency. The three ordinances, subject to differing conditions, make provision for an injured party directly tosue the insurers of an allegedly responsible tortfeasor; by which expression is comprehended a party in breach of statutory duty.Section 11 of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance specifically refers to the Third Parties (Risks against Insurers) Ordinance and the provisoto section 6(1) refers to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees Compensation Ordinance</a>. Be that as may the relevant sections of the Motor vehicles Ordinance cannot, in my view, be construed as statutory modificationsto policies of insurance which, as between the contracting parties, remain of full force and effect while <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>, read in context, does not admit of the meaning "connected with or related to a contract."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> It has none the less become apparent to me, on analysis, that whereas the words "arising otherwise than by reason of a contract -"postulate the exclusion of a causal relationship between a contract and a demand, one of the causes of the demands with which weare presently concerned is the existence of a contract of insurance albeit the terms of the legislation constitute another and, arguably,the critical cause. The word "solely" does not appear between "than" and "by" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>. It is on this somewhat laconically stated ground that I too find that the material directions of Jones J. are unsustainable andthat claims under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 9</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a> of the Ordinance, unliquidated at the commencement of the winding-up of an insolvent company, are prima facie admissible to proof.Accordingly I agree that this appeal should be allowed in the terms of an order or declaration to be the subject of further consideration.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(M.

Having reached that conclusion, I do not think it necessary to consider whether such a demand or right is contractualor statutory; it is sufficient that it arises by reason of a contract.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Accordingly I, also, would allow the appeal and agree that counsel should be heard on the terms of the order to be made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>17th April 1986</p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1986/143.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
