The 1st Plaintiffs in this action are the registered owners of a piece of land known asSection A of Lot  No. 75, Section A of Lot No. 78, The Remaining Portion of Lot No. 78 and Lot No. 79 in Demarcation District No.83 ("Adjacent Land"), which is adjacent to the Disputed Land.  The Defendant is the registered owner of those pieces of land registeredas the Remaining Portion of Lot No. 75, Lot No. 76 and the Remaining Portion of Lot.No. 77 in Demarcation District No. 83, of whichthe Disputed Land forms part.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is a tenant of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, and occupies a part of the Disputed Land.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  There are separate legal proceedings in the District Court between the 1st Plaintiffs and the Defendant, in Action Number 3039 of2005 (âDCCJ 3039â), in which the Defendant claims (as plaintiff) against the 1st Plaintiffs and the 2nd Plaintiff (as defendants)for possession of the Disputed Land.  By way of defence, the defendants in DCCJ  3039 claim that the title of the plaintiff in thesaid action to the Disputed Land had been extinguished by virtue of their adverse possession of the Disputed Land for more than 20years.  Initially, summary judgment was entered in DCCJ  3039 in favor of the Defendant (as plaintiff in DCCJ 3039) on the basisof the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Chan Tin Shi</i> <i>v. Li Ting Sung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 HKC 1</a>, but execution on the judgment was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal to be determined by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i>.  When the Court of Final Appeal reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i>, the parties initially agreed to set aside the summary judgment obtained, but negotiations on the terms apparently broke down andthe matter was not fully resolved. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The acts complained of</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Matters took a drastic turn in May 2007, when unidentified parties, claiming to be representatives of the Defendant in these proceedings,visited the 2nd Plaintiff as well as Wah Fu Marble Company Ltd. (â Wah Fuâ), which is another tenant of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs occupying a part of the Disputed Land, and demanded rent from the 2nd Plaintiff and from Wah Fu in respect of their occupationand possession of the Disputed Land.  According to the evidence of the Plaintiffs filed in support of the ex parte application forinjunction, the 2nd Plaintiff and Wah Fu were informed that if they refused to pay rent for their last few years of occupation andrefused to sign tenancy agreements with the Defendant, these representatives would take action to fence off the Disputed Land.  Redmarks were painted on the Disputed Land for erecting the fence.  Reports were made to the police, security guards were called in,and meetings were held between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, but matters could not be resolved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 5 July 2007, representatives of the Defendant erected iron poles on the Defendantâs own land but immediately outside the maingate of the Disputed Land, which main gate was (according to the Plaintiffs) the only entrance to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs premises.  On 6 July 2007, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff removed two of the iron poles erected by the Defendant for their vehicles to pass through, and the Defendant then blockedthe main gate by a lorry.  On 7 July 2007,the Defendant erected again the two iron poles which were removed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff on 6 July 200 and erected metal sheets instead.  On the same day, the Defendant sent representatives to erect iron polesand metal sheets to block the small gate at the other end of the Disputed Land which was the only entrance to the premises of WahFu.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The ex parte application</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 7 July 2007, the Plaintiffs applied to the court ex parte with notice served in the course of the hearing and was eventuallygranted an injunction ("Order") which restrained the Defendant, whether by itself, its servants, agents, employees or otherwise howsoeverfrom blocking or otherwise erecting any structure obstructing the access to or egress from the entrances to or exits from the Plaintiffsâpremises situate on the Disputed Land (referred to as "the Trespassed Land" in paragraph 1 (a) of the Order), until the return dateon 13 July 2007 or until further order.  The Plaintiffs now seek by the Summons  the continuation of the Order, as well as furtherinjunctions to restrain the Defendant, whether by itself, its servants, agents, employees or otherwise howsoever from (1) intimidating,annoying, causing nuisance to or otherwise interfering with or in any way disturbing the peaceful and quiet enjoyment by the Plaintiffs,their servants or agents of the Plaintiffsâ premises including the Disputed Land, or threatening to do any of the above acts; and (2) inciting, procuring, instigating or permitting, directly or indirectly, any person to do any of the said acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Whether there was material non-disclosure</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In opposing the Summons, the Defendant claims that the Plaintiffs had failed at the ex parte hearing to make full and frank disclosure. It is claimed that at the ex parte application, the Plaintiffs had misled the court when claiming that the main gate to the premisesof the 2nd Plaintiff was the only entrance to the 2nd Plaintiff's premises, and that the small gate to the premises of Wah Fu wasthe only entrance to Wah Fu's premises.  The Defendant claims that in fact, people and vehicles can pass through the Disputed Landfrom the main gate to the small gate, and vice versa.  The Defendant submits that on 7 July 2007, when the ex parte injunction wasgranted, the court might have a misconception that if the main gate was blocked by the Defendant, the Plaintiffs would not have anyvehicular access to or egress from the 2nd Plaintiffs' premises.  The Defendant submits that if the Plaintiffs had disclosed to thecourt the fact that vehicles might pass through the small gate to gain access to the 2nd Plaintiffâs premises, "albeit with difficulty",the degree of legitimate urgency in granting the ex parte injunction would have been lesser.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In support of the claim of material non-disclosure, an affirmation of Chan Ho Chi was filed on behalf of the Defendant.  Plans areexhibited to the affirmation, to show that there are two roads leading to the Disputed Land.  One leads to the main gate of the DisputedLand (" Blue Road"), and one leads to the small gate at the other end of the Disputed Land ("Pink Road").  The Defendant claims thatparagraphs 34 and 35 of the 1st affirmation of Chan Chak Sang ("Chan") made on behalf of the Plaintiffs and used at the hearing on7 July 2007 suggest that the Blue Road is the only vehicular access to the Plaintiffs' premises which, the Defendant claims, is untrue,as the Plaintiffs could have used the Pink Road "with no difficulty at all".</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is obviously important to examine paragraphs 34 and 35 of the 1st affirmation of Chan, as this was the main affirmation filedin support of the Plaintiffs' application when the ex parte injunction was granted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Chan states in paragraph 34 of his 1st affirmation as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">On 5 July 2007, the Defendant's agents and/or servants came to the said land again and intended to erect iron poles on the Defendant'sown land but immediately outside the main gate of the said Land (<i>defined in hisaffirmation to mean the Adjacent Land and the Disputed Land</i>) <b>which is the only entrance of the 2nd Plaintiff's business premises</b>. â¦ There are now produced and shown to me marked "CCS-13" a bundle of photographs taken at the said land on 5 July 2007 showingthat the said iron poles had totally blocked the said main gate and prevented vehicles from entering and/or leaving the said Landwhich has totally interfered with the business of the second Plaintiff.

It is relevant to consider the 2nd affirmationto obtain a picture of what the Plaintiffs informed the court on 7 July 2007.  In addition to correcting errors contained in his1st affirmation, Chan states in his 2nd affirmation:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">"</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">5.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">There is a family residing within the business premises of the 2nd Plaintiff.  <b>The main gate is the only entrance of the 2nd Plaintiff for vehicles to pass through.</b>  The said family has been residing in the said location for more than 40 years. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">6.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">On 7 July 2007, <b>both the main gate and the smaller gate referred to in my 1st affirmation have been blocked</b> by iron poles and metal sheets and have been so blocked ever since until on the day of the making of this my affirmation.

In his 1st affirmation,Chan referred to the main gate as "the only entrance of the 2nd Plaintiff's business premises".  He separately referred to the smallgate as "the only entrance of Wah Fu".  From the Skeleton Argument of the Plaintiffs used at the ex parte hearing on 7 July 2007,it is also clear that the Plaintiffs referred to the Defendants' erection of iron poles outside the main entrance as completely blockingvehicular access to and egress from the 2nd Plaintiff's premises, and separately to the erection of iron poles outside the entrancegate of Wah Fu, as completely blocking vehicular access to and egress from Wah Fu's premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It would appear from the materials laid before the learned judge on 7 July 2007 that the main thrust of the Plaintiffs' submissionswhich led to the grant of the injunction on 7 July 2007 was that the Plaintiffs' business interests had been severely tampered with,and that the safety of the occupiers on the Disputed Land was at stake, particularly in the event of emergencies, when the main gateand the small gate were blocked.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In response to the evidence filed on behalf of the Defendant, the Plaintiffs produced evidence to explain that the 2nd Plaintiffand Wah Fu, as tenants of the 1st Plaintiffs, occupy different portions of the Disputed Land and the Adjacent Land, which portionsof land are physically divided.  Both the 2nd Plaintiff and Wah Fu carry on the business of marble trading and processing.  The BlueRoad leads to the main gate, which is the only entrance of  the 2nd Plaintiff.  The Pink Road leads to the small gate, which is theonly entrance for the premises of Wah Fu.  According to the Plaintiffs, the portions of the land occupied by the 2nd Plaintiff andby Wah Fu respectively are physically separated, and there is no thoroughfare for vehicles from one part of the Disputed Land tothe other part.  Vehicles may only pass from one part of the Disputed Land to the other if and only if the structures, erectionsand buildings which separate the business premises of the 2nd Plaintiff and those of Wah Fu are removed or demolished.  The Plaintiffs'evidence is that even if these structures, etc are removed, large or long vehicles such as container trailers and some types of emergencyand fire services vehicles will not be able to pass through the Disputed Land from the small gate at one end to the other parts ofthe Disputed Land at the other end, because there is a sharp bend on the Pink Road leading to the small gate which prevents largeor long vehicles to enter the Disputed Land through the small gate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Photographs have been adduced by the Plaintiffs to show the structures which exist and which divide or separate the parts of theDisputed Land occupied by the 2nd Plaintiff and Wah Fu.  These comprise large metal frames, buildings, steel structures and metalstorage containers - the last of which are, unfortunately, commonly seen on New Territories land in Hong Kong.  It appears to beclear from the photographs that these structures which exist and stand on the premises in question are not readily transportable. I therefore cannot accept the Defendants' submissions to the effect that the Plaintiffs should have informed the court on 7 July2007 that vehicles could easily or otherwise pass through the Disputed Land from the small gate at one end to the main gate or the2nd Plaintiffs' premises at the other end, and vice versa, if the metal containers and other structures were demolished or removedby some means.  Nor am I persuaded that the learned judge would have considered that the safety of the occupiers within the DisputedLand would not have been jeopardized, or that the business interests of the 2nd Plaintiff would not have been affected, had the Plaintiffsdisclosed this fact.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  More importantly, as counsel for the Plaintiffs pointed out, both the main gate and the small gate had been blocked by 7 July 2007when the Defendant erected iron poles and metal sheets immediately outside both gates.  Even if it were true, as the Defendant alleges,that despite the blocking of the main gate, there was still vehicular access to the 2nd Plaintiffs' premises from the small gateon the other end of the Disputed Land, this point is immaterial or academic, as the small gate was in fact also blocked by the Defendant. Counsel for the Plaintiff also pointed out that Chan Ho Chi was only able to state, in his affirmation filed on behalf of the Defendant,that provisions were made for people (and not vehicles) to walk in and through the Disputed Land after the iron poles were installed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Having considered all the evidence, I do not accept that the fact of vehicles being able to pass from one end of the Disputed Landto the other ( i.e. from the small gate to the main gate) <b><i>provided</i></b> that the large structures currently standing on the Disputed Land are removed or demolished, is material or relevant to the weighingoperation which the court has to make in deciding whether or not to grant the Order on the ex parte application.  There is no materialnon-disclosure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The continuation of the injunction</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In relation to the Plaintiffs' application for the continuation of the injunction granted under the Order, I am satisfied that thereis a serious question to be tried as to the Defendants' liability to the Plaintiffs in nuisance, in relation to their acts of blockingand obstructing the access to and egress from the Disputed Land (<i>Lippiatt v. Gloucestershire Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20All%20ER%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 All ER 149</a>; Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts para 20-52).  The Defendant's' liability for the intimidation of the 2nd Plaintiff and Wah Fu is alsoa question to be tried.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In the affirmation of Chan Ho Chi filed in opposition to the Summons, it is claimed that the iron posts where the Defendant hadinstalled the new gates outside the main entrance were installed on the land belonging to the Defendant, and not on the DisputedLand.  Even if this is true, the iron poles and the new gates referred to by the Defendant had the effect of completely blockingthe entrance to the premises of the 2nd Plaintiff.  There is a serious question to be tried as to whether this constitutes nuisancein the form of interference with the Plaintiffs' rights of enjoyment of the Disputed Land in which the 1st Plaintiffs claim to havetitle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In relation to the obstruction of the small gate, and the iron poles and metal sheets which were erected outside Wah Fu's premises,it is clear even from the plan exhibited to the affirmation of Chan Ho Chi filed on behalf of the Defendant that the obstructionwas erected on the public Pink Road, such that the Defendant had no right whatsoever to do this.  When this was pointed out to theDefendant, it offered at the hearing on 28 August 2007 an undertaking not to block or obstruct the entrance to or exit from the premisesof Wah Fu, essentially in terms of paragraph 1 of the Order.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Having been satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried, I am also satisfied on the evidence that damages awarded attrial will not be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiffs, particularly since the personal safety of individuals working and residingwithin the Disputed Land is concerned.  The balance of convenience is in favor of maintaining the status quo so far as the parties'use of their land is in question.  The Plaintiffs and their predecessors in title have been occupying and using the Disputed Landwithout disturbance by or encroachment from the Defendant or its predecessors in title since 1973, and the 2nd Plaintiff and WahFu, as licensees of the 1st Plaintiffs, have been using the main gate and the small gate as their respective entrances to their premises. The Defendant only took steps from May 2007 to erect the iron poles and the metal sheets and otherwise to obstruct the gates andprevent the 2nd Plaintiff and Wah Fu to gain access to the Blue Road and the Pink Road.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Orders</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  I am therefore prepared to grant an order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 of the Summons.
