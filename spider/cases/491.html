Since about 1989, it hasrun a renowned public educational programme called "Project Hope" (å¸æå·¥ç¨) which aims at providing subsidized education toimpoverished children in rural areas in the mainland. In doing so, the Plaintiff would from time to time pledge for public supportand donations, often in the form of promotional campaigns. Hong Kong has been one of the areas targeted for these campaigns. Thesubsidies provided by "Project Hope" include assisting students to pay for their fees and building/improving school buildings andrelated facilities.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> D1 was at the material time the publisher of a weekly magazine published in Hong Kong (and also among the Chinese communities overseas)called "The Next Magazine" (å£¹é±å). D2 and D3 were respectively the editor and reporter of this magazine. It is undisputed thatits average circulation in Hong Kong from January to June, 1994 came to some 152,000 copies.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> A report relating to "Project Hope" was published in its Issue 202 on about 21 January, 1994. The report can be found on the Issue'scover, its editor's introductory remarks and its contents page. An article also appeared therein as a cover story. All the aboveare collectively called "the Article" below.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Plaintiff commenced this action complaining that the Article is defamatory of the Plaintiff. The Defendants deny the claim andcontend that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the parts of the Article relied upon by the Plaintiff did not bear a defamatory meaning;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) they were not defamatory of the Plaintiff;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) if they were defamatory of the Plaintiff, the Defendant can "justify" those parts of the issue;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) further to (c), the Defendants can rely on the defence of "fair comments";</p>        <p align="justify">(e) further to (c) and (d), the Defendants can rely on the defence of "qualified privilege";</p>        <p align="justify">(f) in any event, the Plaintiff is unable to establish any loss or damage.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Preliminary Objection (1): Proof of the Pleaded Case</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Further to the contentions set out under "Introduction" above, Mr Wong for the defence raises 2 preliminary objections. The firstobjection is related to the way in which the Plaintiff's case was pleaded in its Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The words complained of must be set out verbatim in a statement of claim in a defamation action: see <em>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobs Precedents of Pleadings</em> (1990) 13th Ed., p. 623. To meet that requirement, the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim herein sets out in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and6 thereof the words in the Article which are the subject of complaint. All these paragraphs are set out in a similar manner as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The [specified part of the Article] alleged <em>in ... Chinese characters</em> (the English translation whereof is set out in the Particulars below) ... that [the meaning or effect of the words is set out]" (emphasissupplied), or:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The [specified part of the Article] repeated <em>in Chinese characters</em> (the English translation whereof is set out in the Particulars below) the aforesaid allegations concerning [the meaning or effectof the words is set out]" (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The pleading then sets out by way of particulars the English translation of those Chinese characters. The Chinese characters concernedwith the allegations set out in para. 3 to 6 thereof are set out in the Schedule attached to the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim.Certified English translation of Issue 202 was included in the document bundle used at the trial.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr Wong argues that the certified English translation relied on by the Plaintiff bears no reference to any of the words in the Englishtranslations in the particulars given in the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim. Since the Plaintiff must prove its case as pleadedin the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim (which the Plaintiff has chosen to plead in English) in order to succeed, Mr Wong contendsthat the Plaintiff must fail in this action for failing to prove its pleaded case; that is, the English words pleaded are not supportedby the certified English translation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This objection is highly technical, but what is important is it has no substance. The relevant paragraphs of the Re-Re-Amended Statementof Claim clearly complain about the Chinese characters. The actual characters themselves are set out in the Schedule attached to,and are expressly referred to in the body of, the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim. The action was set down for trial before a bilingualJudge (originally with a jury). It is therefore abundantly clear that the Plaintiff has always intended to prove that the Chinesecharacters in the Article were defamatory. Indeed, from time to time throughout the trial, counsel for both sides referred to theChinese characters rather than the English translation (whether certified or not).</p>    <p class="heading">Preliminary Objection (2): the Plaintiff's Capacity to Sue</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr Wong's second objection is related to an alleged lack of capacity by the Plaintiff to commence this action. He refers to <em>The Supreme Court Practice 1999,</em> Vol. 1, para. 18/19/39 (and the cases cited therein) for support:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Authority to sueâIf the Court becomes aware that the plaintiff is incapable of giving a retainer, it will strike out the actionat the trial without any formal application (<em>Daimler Co. v. Continental Tyre Co.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1916%5d%202%20AC%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1916] 2 A.C. 337).</a> But if the defendant desires to question the authority to sue in the plaintiff's name, he must apply to strike out the plaintiff'sname at an early stage; he cannot by his defence dispute the authority, nor can he do so at the trial ... ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The factual basis on which this objection of Mr Wong is based is this. It is common ground that the Plaintiff is in substance a legalperson similar to a Hong Kong limited company. Mr Wong contends that there is no provision in any of the documents adduced by thePlaintiff to confer capacity on its part to commence this action.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> <strong>Daimler Co. v. Continental Tyre Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1916%5d%202%20AC%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1916] 2 AC 307</a> is a case with very special facts. In short, an English company sued another English company in England at a time when there waswar between Britain and Germany. All the directors of the plaintiff company were, however, Germans resident in Germany. The Houseof Lords concluded they were the enemies and incapable of exercising their powers as directors. Hence, the plaintiff's claim shouldfail for that reason.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In the present case, the Plaintiff's "Articles of Association" (ç« ç¨) contain inter alia the following clauses:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) <em>Article 1:</em> the Plaintiff is a non-profit making social organization with independent legal person status;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) <em>Article 2:</em> the Plaintiff's objectives are to obtain support and donation from local and overseas societies and persons who are concerned withthe affairs of youth in China, to promote the development of the work and education .. and welfare of youth ... ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(c) <em>Article 22:</em> the fund of the Plaintiff comes from the donations from societies, organizations and individuals within China and overseas ... andother legal income;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) <em>Article 23:</em> the Plaintiff shall apply the fund raised to the business which meets the objectives of the Plaintiff and to fund projects accordingto the wishes of the donors.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">It is not suggested by the Defence (nor can it properly be suggested) that one of the Plaintiff's businesses was to commence or carryon legal actions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Because the Plaintiff was registered in the mainland, strictly speaking this issue should be resolved by examining Chinese law regardingthe Plaintiff's capacity to sue. No expert evidence on the relevant Chinese law has been adduced by either party. The parties donot dispute that in the absence of such expert evidence, I am to apply Hong Kong law in approaching this issue: see also <em>Dicey &amp; Morris on The Conflict of Laws</em> (2000) 13th Ed., Vol. 1, Rule 18(2), para. 9-001 (p. 221) and para. 9-025 (p. 232). Sometimes this was stated as the courts willpresume foreign law to be the same as Hong Kong law in the absence of satisfactory evidence on foreign law: see 8(1) <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> (1996) 4th Ed., para. 1093, text to n. 6.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The following provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a> set out the powers of a limited company:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"5A. Powers of a company</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(1) A company has the capacity and the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person.</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(2) ... a company may do anything which it is permitted or required to do by its memorandum or by any enactment or rule of law.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">5B. Power limited by memorandum, etc.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(1) A companyâ</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) whose objects are stated in its memorandum shall not carry on any business or do anything that it is not authorized by its memorandumto carry on or do; and</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) shall not exercise any power which is expressly excluded or modified by its memorandum ... , contrary to such exclusion or modification.</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">...</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(3) An act of a company ... is not invalid by reason only that it contravenes subsection (1)".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> With respect to Mr Wong, I consider he has failed to distinguish between the rights, powers and privileges of a company as a (legal)person as opposed to the objects of a company. The former is governed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s5a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5A</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a> whereas the latter by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s5b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5B</a> thereof. It is of course trite law that a company can only transact businesses falling within its objects. However, this does notmean that there is a need to set out in a company's memorandum all the things incidental to the businesses which the company is authorizedby its memorandum to transact, for example, to sue to enforce its legal rights or to employ staff to carry on its businesses andso on. In fact, I understand it is rare that this is done in relation to companies incorporated in Hong Kong. As was observed inthe chapter dealing with "Advantages and Disadvantages of Incorporation" and under the heading "Suing and being sued" in the variouseditions of <em>Gower's Principles of Modern Company Law</em>:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"[after referring to the problems with unincorporated bodies] Needless to say, none of these difficulties arises when an incorporatedcompany is suing or being sued; the company as a legal person can take action to enforce its legal rights and can be sued for breachof its legal duties. ... " (p. 104 of the 4th edition and p. 92 of the 5th edition).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> For the above reasons, I conclude that both the passages in <em>The Supreme Court Practice 1999</em> and the <strong>Daimler</strong> case have no relevance to this action and find that the Plaintiff has the capacity to commence this action. Further, if in fact thePlaintiff's capacity to sue should fall within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s5b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5B</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>, such an act is still not invalid by reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s5b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 5B(3)</a> thereof.</p>    <p class="heading">Witnesses' Credibility and Findings of Fact</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Only the Plaintiff called 2 witnesses to testify during the trial, the Defendant did not call any witness. The Plaintiff's 2 witnesseswere Mr Xu Yong Guang (å¾æ°¸å) ("<em>Xu</em>"), the Plaintiff's secretary general and legal representative, and Mr Yang Xiao Yu (æ¥æç¦¹) ("<em>Yang</em>"), the manager of the Plaintiff's overseas section.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Despite Mr Wong's thorough cross-examination, I am satisfied that the testimony of Xu and Yang is truthful and reliable in relationto the matters regarding liability. However, having considered the parties' submissions and the relevant materials, I find that thattheir testimony relating to matters relevant to quantum of loss cannot be relied upon because it is based more on personal opinion,projection and/or speculations.</p>    <p class="heading">Is the Article Defamatory of the Plaintiff?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> For ease of reference, the passages in the Article which were referred to (and particularized) in para. 3 to 6 of the Re-Re-AmendedStatement of Claim are attached to this Judgment as "Schedule 1". Further, all the points made in the parties' respective closingsubmissions have been considered even though some of them have not been expressly set out herein.</p>    <p class="heading">(a) Relevant Legal Principles</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Having heard the parties' submissions, I do not find that there is any substantial difference or dispute between them as to the applicablelaw regarding how this issue is to be determined. The relevant legal principles include the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the matter complained of was calculated to hold the Plaintiff up to "hatred, contempt or ridicule";</p>        <p align="justify">(b) whether the words would tend to lower the Plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally or wouldcause it to be shunned or avoided;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the defamatory nature of the publication depends upon the probabilities of the case and the natural tendency of the publicationhaving regard to the surrounding circumstances;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) if a publication is defamatory in its ordinary meaning, it is irrelevant whether it was (or was not) actually not believed bysome readers to be defamatory;</p>        <p align="justify">(e) the mere intention to vex and annoy will not make the language defamatory if it is not so in its own nature;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(f) in construing the publication, the whole document is to be taken into account, provided it all relates to the same defamatorymeaning;</p>        <p align="justify">(g) words are to be taken in the sense it is most natural and obvious.

The Plaintiff argues that this theme was illustrated by the Defendantsby way of the following examples:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the matters set out in para. (d)(2) above relating to the missing RMB460,000 and RMB180,000;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the matters set out in para. (d)(5) above relating to missing records;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the matters set out in para. (d)(6) above relating to share speculation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(c) The Defendants' Case</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The following arguments are advanced by Mr Wong in relation to this heading:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the Article read as a whole does not suggest that the whole of the $70 million donation has gone missing;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the derogatory remarks were not directed against the Plaintiff;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the references to the Plaintiff were not derogatory.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(d) Decision on this Issue</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> As stated above, the whole document should be taken into account regarding this issue. However, Mr Wong's skeleton submissions referto specific parts of the Article. For this reason, I propose to deal with them before considering the Article as a whole.</p>    <p class="heading">Did the Article Say that $70 Million was Missing?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Wong further elaborates the above arguments as follows. First, the cover headline only said that donations of Project Hope werefound missing, it did not say that the entire $70 million was found missing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Having looked at the headline in isolation, I agree that the headline can either mean what Mr Wong contends, or that the whole $70million was found missing. I consider the headline is capable of having the latter meaning because the sum of $70 million was expresslyreferred to in the headline, it may therefore give a reasonable reader the impression that "the missing donations" refer to the "$70million". However, since the Article should be read and considered as a whole, the true meaning of the headline ought to be dealtwith together with the other parts of the Article. This will be dealt with further under the sub-heading "The True Meaning of theArticle".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Secondly, Mr Wong contends that the contents page also did not say that the whole $70 million was found missing. He relies on thefollowing passage:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... å»ç¼ç¾å¤§ç­ææ¬¾ä¸ç¥æè¸ª".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In an earlier paragraph of the same part of the Article, however, the following passage can be found:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... å¸æå·¥ç¨ ... å¨é¦æ¸¯æäºå©å¹´, ... å±æäºä¸åè¬å ... ä½éä¸åè¬åæå¾å»äºé£è£,å»ä»ç¶ä¸æ¸ä¸æ¥".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Again, the true meaning of this part of the Article should be considered with its other parts. However, taking into account the passagequoted above, I find the contents page on its own meant that the whole $70 million has gone missing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Thirdly, Mr Wong relies on the following passage in the editor's introductory remarks:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">" ... è¨èå¾æ±åæ¡è¨ªæ ... æ¸ä¸åæçå¶ä¸­ä¸æå¸æå°å­¸,å»ç¼ç¾ææ¬¾æç¶ä¸ç¥æçµ[è¸ª]",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">and submits that these funds were the ones said to have gone missing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Even if one were to limit one's consideration to this part of the Article, I consider that it is capable of meaning that other fundsmight have gone missing as well. The "introductory remarks" start by saying that some reporters have donated to Project Hope beforebut none of them received any information about the students. After the passage relied upon by Mr Wong, the "introductory remarks"continued to say that after an on-and-off investigation by D3 for some 5 months, clues were discovered by the reporter. The investigation(and the report) was finally completed after D3 has located and confronted the Plaintiff which was responsible for the whole project.The tenor of the "introductory remarks" was that the story unearthed by D3 was wider than the incident found in Jilin Province. Asstated earlier, this part of the Article should also be considered together with the other parts.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Fourthly, Mr Wong says that the same applies to the incident regarding the donation of Madam Lam (found at p. 54 of the Article).Since the passage in question was part of the "cover story" itself, I find that it must be read and considered together with theother parts of the Article.</p>    <p class="heading">Were the Derogatory Remarks made against the Plaintiff?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> At para. 7 of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions, he made the point that whenever criticisms were made, they were not made against thePlaintiff, but either against village representatives, the individual schools or their individual staff, or were general criticismsdirected against no particular individual. In this connection, he draws my attention to the following parts of the Article: referencesto "éé·" (at pp. 50 and 52 of the Issue), "è¬æ ¡é·" (at p. 54 thereof) and "å­¸æ ¡" and "èå¸«" (at p. 56 thereof). Further,possible reason for the delay in remitting the money has been given (referring to p. 54 of the Issue). I conclude that these referencesought to be considered together with the rest of the Article.</p>    <p class="heading">Were the References to the Plaintiff Derogatory?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> At para. 8 of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions, he contends that references to the Plaintiff in the Article were not derogatory remarks.On the contrary, the Article reported the Plaintiff would investigate the problems and therefore showed the Plaintiff as being responsible.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Mr Wong finally submits at para. 9 of his skeleton submissions that although a heading in the cover story says "Using the donationsfor share speculation", the contents of that part of the Article under that heading did not actually say that the Plaintiff speculatedin shares.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Similar to the conclusion made under the earlier sub-heading, these should be considered in the context of the Article.</p>    <p class="heading">The True Meaning of the Article</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Mr Wong argues that the Article merely reported the following findings of D3:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) donations had disappeared for more than a year;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) some schools abusively charged a variety of fees;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) children of senior cadres were hogging school places.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">No doubt the Article expressly stated the above matters. But whether the Article also carries in addition the meaning contended forby the Plaintiff (see the earlier paragraphs under the sub-heading "The Plaintiff's Case") is the issue over which the parties areengaged in this action.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As stated above, in order to determine this issue, I will have to consider the Article in the context in which it appeared in theIssue. Before turning to that aspect, the relevant legal principles should be stated first.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The test to be adopted to determine whether words convey a defamatory meaning to those to whom they were published is set out in<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (1998) 9th Ed.:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The essence of libel is the publication of written words to a person or persons by whom they would be reasonably understood to bedefamatory of the plaintiff ... In the case of words defamatory in their ordinary sense it is not permissible to call evidence toprove that anyone did understand the words in a defamatory sense, but the question is simply whether reasonable people would haveso understood them" (para. 3.13).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The fictitious "reasonable person" is described as one with the following temperament:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"He is a sort of half way house between the unusually suspicious and the unusually na?ve. He is essentially fair-minded and reasonableand does not jump to hostile conclusions on flimsy evidence; but he may be guilty of a certain amount of loose thinking and doesnot read a sensational article with cautious and critical care ... and his capacity for implication or drawing inferences is greaterthan the lawyer's ... The layman reads in an implication much more freely, and ... is especially prone to do so when it is derogatory"(para. 3.23 of <em>Gatley</em>).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I have borne in mind the above principles when considering the true meaning of the Article. Further, the reasons why I concludedthat the Article read as a whole conveyed the meaning contended for by the Plaintiff include the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the layout on the cover of the Issue and the way in which the heading on the cover was worded regarding the loss of donationswas intended to be sensational and strongly suggested the discovery of a scandalous incident;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) in relation to the contents page, the words "å»ç¼ç¾å¤§ç­ææ¬¾ä¸ç¥æè¸ª" appeared after the reference to "ä½éä¸åè¬å... å»äºåªè£,å»ä»ç¶ä¸ç¥æè¸ª". The reference to "å¤§ç­ææ¬¾" in this context means a sum in the region of $70 million;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) there were express references to the Plaintiff in the editor's introductory remarks and the cover story itself. The Plaintiffwas described as follows: (1) in the editor's introductory remarks, the Plaintiff was described as "è² è²¬æ´é è¨åç ... ";(2) in the cover story, the Plaintiff was described as "çµ±è¾¦å¸æå·¥ç¨ç ... " (p. 49 of the Issue), "æç®¡äºåææ¬¾çåºéæ... " (p. 52 thereof), "ç¸½é¨" and "... åºéæåäº¬ç¸½é¨ ... " (p. 54 thereof), "æ°è¾¦çä¸­åéå°å¹´ç¼å±åºéæä¸å¹´å¤åéå§æå¸æå·¥ç¨...

" (p.58 thereof),;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(d) in the cover story itself, the contents were punctuated by headings printed in red. By and large, all the headings were derogatoryin nature (except those which say "Artistes denying pocketing the fees" and "Hong Kong donated $70 million").</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In relation to Mr Wong's argument that the Article did not convey the meaning that $70 million has gone missing, this sum has repeatedlyappeared on the cover, the contents page, the first page of the cover story (p. 48 of the Issue) and at pp. 50 ("several tens ofmillion") and 54 ("out of which $70 million came from Hong Kong donations"). The other parts of the Article referred to large sumshaving gone missing or astray, or remittances taking exceedingly lengthy time to arrive, a widespread phenomenon of peasants or studentsbeing required to pay for all kinds of "expenses", corruption and the loss of record of donations. In these circumstances, I agreewith the Plaintiff that the Article conveyed the message that $70 million had gone missing.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In relation to Mr Wong's argument that the derogatory remarks were made against other parties and not the Plaintiff, I consider thatthe repeated express reference to the Plaintiff as being "in charge" of (one passage, at p. 58 thereof, actually said that the Plaintiffwas responsible for "monitoring") the "Project Hope" funds conveyed the message that the Plaintiff was responsible for the flawsalleged in the Article, in particular the allegedly missing $70 million.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Wong's contention that the references to the Plaintiff were not derogatory again has to be considered in context. The passagesin the cover story regarding the Plaintiff would investigate the problems were short paragraphs placed at or towards the end (lastpage) of the cover story. In effect, an explanation given by Mr Yang of the Plaintiff was set out (but there is no independent verificationof this explanation). This is to be contrasted with the other parts of the cover story about the various incidents of inadequaciesin the management of the funds (which took up some 4 pages in total) which were purportedly discovered by the reporter from "independent"sources. The message it conveyed was that there was a self-serving statement being made by the Plaintiff to explain the inadequacies.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Wong's argument that the contents (as opposed to the relevant heading) of the cover story did not accuse share speculation alsohas to be considered in context. I consider it shows (at least as far as that part of the cover story is concerned) at best a recklessdisregard of the true position (set out in the passages under that heading) or at worst a deliberate attempt to "sensationalize"the topic.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> For the above reasons, I agree the Article conveyed the meaning contended for by the Plaintiff, in particular,</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) $70 million of the donated funds had gone missing;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) there were many incidents of chaotic or mis-management of the donations;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the Plaintiff was responsible for the above because it was the body responsible for collecting, distributing and monitoring thedonations;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) the loss was caused by the Plaintiff's incompetence or negligence.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> To avoid any doubt, I have already taken into consideration the alternative meanings Mr Wong put forward (see the sub-headings aboveunder this heading) when coming to this conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence (1): Justification</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> At least from a practical point of view, the burden of proof is on the Defendants to show that the defamation is substantially true:Gatley, para. 11.3. If the Defendants prove that "the main chare, or gist, of the libel" is true, they need not justify statementsor comments which do not add to the "sting" of the charge: <em>Gatley</em>, para. 11.7 and para. 10.1 of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> By reason of my earlier findings on the true meaning of the Article, I do not consider there is any evidence or material to supportsuch a defence. Therefore, insofar as the Defendants have the burden of proving this defence, I conclude that they have failed todo so.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In the part of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions dealing with this defence, he argues that this defence has been established in relationto the individual aspects set out therein. These were different from the "sting" of the charge which I found earlier and thereforeit is strictly unnecessary for me to deal with them. For the sake of completeness, however, I shall deal with them below.</p>    <p class="heading">(a) Missing Remittance to Xianghai Village</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In relation to the missing remittance sent to Xianghai Village, Mr Wong contends that this episode has been established. He refersto the different accounts given at various times in difference articles as supporting his contention that the Plaintiff's versionof this incident is not credible. Having considered his contention, I find that the Plaintiff's evidence, especially Xu's testimony,is truthful and reliable regarding this. Hence, I find that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) Xianghai Village never applied for and the Plaintiff never approved the donation of RMB460,000;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) RMB180,000 (which was not donated by the Madam Lam referred to in the Article) was received and handed over to Xianghai Villageon 29 July, 1993;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the alleged conversation between Yang and D3 concerning RMB460,000 did not take place.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(b) Charging Fees in Yougi Village</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Mr Wong argues that it was the Plaintiff who promulgated this incident in an attempt to put pressure on the local governments. Havingconsidered the materials referred to by the parties, in particular the way in which it was reported in the China Youth Daily (on16 November, 1993) and Ming Pao (on 27 November, 1993), I find that the student in question (Shen Fei Fung) could well have missedschool for a short period. However, this does not warrant the criticisms levied against the Plaintiff in the Article (as I foundabove).</p>    <p class="heading">(c) Missing Computer Records</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> While it may be true that the Plaintiff's computer records did not contain all the detailed information and breakdown which wouldenable all individual donors (and the amount they donated) to be identified, I do not find this justified the derogatory imputationsmade by the Defendants in the Article.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Further, I agree with the following criticisms made in the Plaintiff's "Closing Submissions" against D3 when she interviewed Yang:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) she did not tell Yang she donated through an intermediary but misled him into thinking she donated through Ming Pao;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) she told Yang not to continue the search after the initial check did not reveal her donation;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) she did not produce any receipt to the Plaintiff despite being requested to;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) she did not tell Yang the way in which her colleague made the donation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(d) Share Speculation</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Despite a heading to such effect in the Article, the Article did not assert the Plaintiff speculated in shares, nor does Mr Wongseek to justify the said heading in the Article. In the context of the Article, I do not find that this assists the Defence case.Quite on the contrary, I consider it shows a complete lack of proper basis for publishing such a sensational heading in the Article.</p>    <p class="heading">(e) Other Matters</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> In Mr Wong's skeleton submissions, he referred to matters like "The structure of the Plaintiff" and "The empty promises by the HongKong artistes". I do not regard that complaints have been made by the Plaintiff over these and therefore do not propose to deal withthem.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> However, at para. 10.7 of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions, he argues that (presumably when taken together with the other matters setout above) these 2 matters support the defence of justification. I will simply say that I disagree with this argument.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Other matters are referred to in the Plaintiff's "Closing Submissions" such as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) whether contributions from the local peasants can properly be regarded as "hacking the poor peasants";</p>        <p align="justify">(b) whether any funds have disappeared or been misapplied;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) whether the children of senior cadres have been given preferential treatment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Incidents such as those set out in (a) to (c) above could well have occurred but there is insufficient evidence that they were widespreador common. Moreover, there is certainly no evidential or other legal basis for saying that the Plaintiff was (or should be) in anyway responsible for any such instances. Further, I do not find that they should be taken into account in assessing damages in viewof my findings on the imputations made in the Article, as well as the reasons given below.</p>    <p class="heading">(d) Partial Justification</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Mr Wong submits that evidence adduced in a partial and unsuccessful defence of justification may go to reduce damage: relying on<em>Gatley</em>, para. 11.11.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> As stated above, I am far from being satisfied that the incidents referred to in (a) to (c) above were common or widespread, or thatthe Plaintiff was (or should be) responsible for any such incidents. There is hence no evidence which tends to damage the Plaintiff'scharacter such as would entitle me to reduce the quantum of damages: <em>Gatley</em>, para. 11.13 and 11.14.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence (2): Fair Comments</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> This part of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions is premised on the basis that I had found for the Defendants regarding the "sting" ofthe libel: see, for example, para. 12.5 and 12.6(b) and (c) of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions. As indicated earlier, I have foundin the Plaintiff's favour over this point. This part of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions is therefore irrelevant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Mr Wong also argues that the Defendants were entitled to make fair comments in their report. While this is in principle correct,the Article was not such a publication.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> The findings made earlier regarding the individual matters set out in sub-headings (a) ("missing Remittance to Xianghai Village")to (e) ("Other Matters") under the heading "Defence (1): Justification" are relevant to this point. In view of the said findings,I do not consider there is sufficient factual basis for the Defendants to make any fair comment regarding the incidents in XianghaiVillage. Similarly, in relation to the Yougi Village incident, by reason of the imputations which I found were made against the Plaintiff,I do not agree with Mr Wong that fair comments were made by the Defendants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> By reason of the above findings, it is unnecessary to consider the question of "malice" in relation to this line of defence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> Mr Wong argues that the Plaintiff's own conduct in using the media to publicize the incident in Yougi Village in order to exert pressureon the local governments should be taken into account (as regards quantum). However, it must be noted, first, the emphasis of thePlaintiff was on the impropriety of the local governments and not "Project Hope" or the Plaintiff, and secondly, this does not justifythe way in which the Article imputes on the Plaintiff's reputation.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence (3): Qualified Privilege</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The Defendants also rely on the defence of "qualified privilege": see para. 14.1 to 14.6 of Mr Wong's skeleton submissions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I agree with the Plaintiff's submissions that the law does not recognize the press has a duty (in relation to this line of defence)to inform the public about public matters: <em>Gatley</em>, para. 14.27, text to n. 63 and 14.81, or that the public has a corresponding interest to receive such matters: <em>Gatley</em>, para. 9.13 and 9.14. The Article therefore does not fall within a "privileged" occasion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In any event, even if the Article fell within an occasion of "qualified privilege", by reason of the earlier findings, it was nota fair and accurate report of the matters stated therein.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> For these reasons, I do not consider this line of defence avails the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">Malice</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The lines of defence "Fair Comment" and "Qualified Privilege" can be defeated by malice on the part of a defendant. I have alreadyrejected both lines of defence in this action for the other reasons stated earlier. For the sake of completeness, I shall also dealwith the question of whether there is evidence of malice on the part of the Defendants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Mr Wong argues that there was a proper motive for D3 to commence her investigation into funds donated to "Project Hope". Further,the fact that D3 actually made trips to various places and interviewed Yang before compiling the report published in the Articleindicates that there was no malice.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> On the other hand, the Plaintiff contends that there was evidence showing that there was malice. One, the report made in the Articlewas inaccurate; in this connection, the Plaintiff refers to the discrepancies between the tape transcript and the purported recordof the interview in the Article. Further, excessive language was used in the Article: see <em>Gatley</em>, para. 32.26.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The Court of Appeal decided in <strong>Tse Wai Chun Paul v. Cheng Gilbert and Anor.</strong>, Civ. App. No. 170 of 1998, the test for "malice" should be the same whether the defence is "fair comment" or "qualified privilege"."Malice" is a fact to be decided in the circumstances of the case but "malice" can usually be proved by the following matters:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) it is proved if the defendant knew or believed what was published was untrue;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) "malice" can also be inferred if the defendant did not care whether what was published was true or not but carelessness, impulsivenessor irrationality is insufficient;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the defendant's knowledge or honest belief of truthfulness is insufficient if it can be proved that the words were published forsome improper motive which was the dominant motive behind the publication;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) personal spite, ill will or a desire to injure the plaintiff is unnecessary.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> Taking all circumstances into account, I agree with the Plaintiff's contention and if it had been necessary to determine the issueof malice (in relation to liability), I would have found that there is evidence to show that the Defendants published the Articlewith malice. In coming to such conclusion, I have taken into account (together with the matters relied on by the Plaintiff set outearlier under this heading) the lack of evidence from defence witness(es) to refute the Plaintiff's case, or to confirm that therewas proper reason for making the libelous statements.</p>    <p class="heading">The Respective Liability of D1, D2 and D3</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> The Defendants did not testify and there is no evidence as to whether different Defendant was responsible for a particular part ofthe Article (and if so, which part(s)). Because of this, I raised the question of whether there is a need to differentiate betweenthe liability of the 3 Defendants in the course of Mr Fung's final submissions. He pointed out that all the Defendants should bejointly liable and the Amended Defence does not seek to differentiate their respective liability: see para. 3 of the Amended Defencewhich admits para. 3 of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim. That part of the Plaintiff's pleading avers in essence that the Articlewas published (or caused to be published) by the 3 Defendants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Mr Wong does not raise any issue over this point either. In these circumstances, I only mention it here for the sake of completeness.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages (1): "General" Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Having decided in the Plaintiff's favour on liability and having concluded that none of the matters referred to above can reducethe quantum of damages, I now turn to consider the first limb of damages sought by the Plaintiff. I have already considered all thepoints made by the parties in their respective closing submissions although not all of them have been set out herein.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> Before actually doing so, I should clarify the matter of terminology. Para. 26.27 of <em>Gatley</em> described "general damages" as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"'The law will presume some damage will flow in the ordinary course of things from the mere invasion of [the plaintiff's] absoluteright to reputation', and he is entitled to such general damages as the court may properly award, although he neither pleads norproves any actual damage".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">This is in contrast to para. 26.28 and 26.29 of Gatley which described "special damage" as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"However, where the plaintiff claims to have suffered any injury going beyond the normal damages which is presumed to follow ... hemust give particulars ... " and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Where the plaintiff claims to have suffered financial loss, he must allege such damage, including a general falling-off of business,with reasonable particularity ... ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">The parties, however, have chosen to call the latter "general damages" or "compensatory damages" as well: see para. 15 of Mr Wong'sskeleton submissions and para. 51 to 52 of the Plaintiff's "Closing Submissions". This is the reason why I decided to include itunder this heading.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> 2 types of loss are claimed under this heading:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) "compensatory damages", that is, damages to "restore the plaintiff, as far as money can do so, to the position he would have beenin if the tort had not been committed": see <em>Hung Yuen Chan Robert v. Hong Kong Standard</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 H.K.C. 519</a>, 533 and they "must be sufficient to publicly and demonstratively and absolutely vindicate the plaintiff and to compensate for seriouslyinjured feelings": see <em>Cheung Ng Sheong Steven v. Eastweek Publisher Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 H.K.C. 601</a>, 613 citing <em>Yu Kwong Chu v. Consolidated Newspapers Ltd</em>, A258/86, unreported;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(b) damages by way of a loss of donations from Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">These 2 types of loss will be dealt with separately below.</p>    <p class="heading">(a) General or Compensatory Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> In relation to this type of damages, Mr Wong refers to about 10 cases in para. 15.2 of his skeleton submissions. The awards madein these cases range from $25,000 in 1987 to $2,500,000 in 1992. On the other hand, Mr Fung relies on the said award of $2,500,000made in 1992 and submits that the present case is in a "class by itself". In assessing the award in this action, I have borne inmind the relevant principles set out above, and the circumstances of this case, in particular:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the Article was published in a magazine which has a circulation of about 150,000 copies at the time;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the imputations made against the Plaintiff in the Article;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the Article appeared therein as one of the cover stories and was given prominence therein as shown by the headline on the cover,the editor's introductory remarks and the contents page;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) my finding that the Defendants published the Article with "malice";</p>        <p align="justify">(e) the Plaintiff was a charitable organization which needs, among other things, a reputation and good public image in order to attractcharitable donations.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">I conclude that an award of $3,500,000 should be awarded under this heading.</p>    <p class="heading">(b) Damages for Loss of Donations</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> The evidence adduced and the arguments advanced regarding this issue makes it a difficult point to decide. The way in which the Plaintiffinvites me to approach this issue is as follows.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> The Plaintiff submits that a comparison should be made between the amounts donated in Hong Kong for the pre-publication period andthe post-publication period, namely:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the 11-month period leading up to January, 1994;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the 11-month period following January, 1994.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">The total amount of donations for period (a) was RMB28 million whereas that for period (b) was RMB7 million. The loss was thereforethe difference between the 2 figures, that is, RMB21 million.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> The Defendant disputes the validity of this approach, pointing out:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) there were other competing organizations or campaigns in Hong Kong during the post-publication period;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(b) a sponsored campaign could "run out of steam";</p>        <p align="justify">(c) in 1993, reports were published about abusive incidents in China, such as students' parents being asked to advance loans;</p>        <p align="justify">(d) there were indications that Ming Pao and Commercial Radio have decided to stop (or suspend) their promotional programme in July,1993;</p>        <p align="justify">(e) similar charitable programmes have been set up by others in the mainland;</p>        <p align="justify">(f) there were minimal promotional activities in Hong Kong after the publication of the Article from about 1995 to 1997.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> The Defence further argues that according to the Plaintiff's case, there were 2 main sources of donation in Hong Kong, namely, (1)donations from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, and (2) those from MingPao. In relation to the 2 Federations, Mr Wong refers to the figures set out in exhibits "D1" and "D2" and points out the total amountdonated in 1994 was in fact more than that for 1993. As regards the total amounts of donations for 1993 and 1994 from Ming Pao, MrWong submits that the decrease was probably caused by Ming Pao "suspending" its promotional support of "Project Hope" as from 19July, 1993.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> Apart from the said 2 main sources, there were also donations made by individuals from Hong Kong when they were in the mainland.There was a drop of this from RMB4,413,318 in 1993 to RMB992,385 in 1994.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> Having considered the parties' submissions and the materials adduced in the trial, I consider the approach advocated by the Plaintiffto be overly simplistic. I agree with Mr Wong that there were numerous factors which may affect the amount of donations made to acertain charity. Having said so, however, I consider that the publication of the Article must have caused some damage to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Merely because an assessment is difficult by reason of the nature of the damage is no reason for awarding no damage or only nominaldamages provided it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred: see <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (1980) 14th Ed., para. 261 and 272. In the present case, although I consider it impossible to adopt an arithmetical approach to thistype of loss, I am satisfied that the loss must have been substantial enough for an award to be made. Taking all things into account,I consider that a sum of $1,350,000 is appropriate. According to the table headed "Drop in Donation between Position Pre-January1994 and Post-January 1994", the total amount of donations in Hong Kong in 1993 was about RMB26.98 million. The above award is about5% of that total which I consider represents the approximate amount of reduction in donations caused by the publication of the Article.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> Mr Fung accepts in his oral submissions that if any award for the loss of donations is made (assuming that the amount of the awardis greater than that for the loss of reputation and injured feeling), the award for the loss of reputation and injured feeling issubsumed in the earlier award. Since I concluded that the award for the loss of donations is less than that for the loss of reputationand injured feeling, it appears to follow from Mr Fung's concession that no separate award ought to be made for the loss of donations.I will thus not do so unless there is indication to the contrary.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages (2): Exemplary Damages</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> In the Plaintiff's written "Opening", the Plaintiff relies on <strong>Cassell &amp; Co. v. Broome</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a>, 1079 in support of its claim under this heading.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Para. 9.15 of <em>Gatley</em> said: "Exemplary damages are intended to punish the defendant for the wilful commission of a tort or to teach him that tort doesnot pay. They are not, even in an attenuated sense, concerned with the compensation of the plaintiff". In the context of defamation,2 conditions must be satisfied before such damages can be considered:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the defendant either knew the defamatory statements were untrue or was reckless as to whether they were true: Gatley, para. 9.16;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the defendant must have acted in the hope or expectation of material gain. The mere fact that the defendant is engaged in a profit-makingactivity, such as publication of a newspaper or a television show, is not of itself sufficient: <em>Gatley</em>, para. 9.17.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Having considered the materials before me, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiff has been able to prove point (b) above. Thus, noaward for exemplary damages will be made.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> If it had been necessary to consider the quantum of exemplary damages, I would have awarded $1,000,000. In making this award, I havetaken into account, among other things, the total amount of sale proceeds for the sale of the Issue ($18 x 152,000 copies = $2,736,000).</p>    <p class="heading">Costs Order Nisi</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> The parties agree that a costs order nisi can be made herein pursuant to RHC Ord. 42 r.
