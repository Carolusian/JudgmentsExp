As regards the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, it was submitted by Mr. Shum that there is no sufficient involvement of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant pleaded in the amended statement of claim.  The only matter alleged against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant is that it provided a âcare of â address at the same New World Office Building address as the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and that the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant has thereby committed the tort of unlawful interference.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Hingorani, however, submitted that the evidence showed that the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant was more than supplying a âcare of â address.  It was actively accepting orders as evidenced by the letter dated 18March 1999 from Renaissance Corporation (Thailand) Ltd. to the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant and the sales invoice issued by the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant to that company. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  This evidence does show that the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant was involved in conducting business.  However, none of that has been pleaded.  The only allegation made against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant in the pleading is that it provided a âcare of â address.  That is insufficient to found the tort of unlawful interferenceagainst the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant in my view.  Unless the activities of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant amounting to the tort of unlawful interference are properly pleaded thereby making it relevant to seek discovery againstit, I am of the view that the order made against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant should not stand.  It would only be a relevant issue for the plaintiff to explore by the process of discovery if it hasmade out a case on the pleadings (<i>Sun Yuet Tai Ltd v. British American Tobacco Co. (HK) Ltd</i>. (unreported CACV No. 95 of 1999, Court of Appeal, 4 June 1999; <i>Annabell Kin Yee Lee &amp; others v Lee Wing Kim (May Lee)</i> (unreported) HCAP No 5 of 2003, Chu J, 5 March 2003).  The order made against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant should, in my view, be set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There has already been discovery of documents made by the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  It was submitted that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant has already on a voluntary basis already supplied relevant documents to the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants to assist them to comply with their obligations on discovery.  Before the joinder of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants, Master M. Yuen made an order on 29 October 2001 ordering the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants to make and file an affidavit stating whether they have or have had at any time in their possession, custody or powerany document specified in the schedule to that order and if any of them had or have been but are not now in their possession, custodyor power stating when it parted with the same and what has become of the same and that there be inspection thereof.  With the benefitof documents voluntarily supplied by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant before it became a party in the action, that order was complied with by affirmation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr. Shum also submitted that with the voluntary disclosure made by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to enable the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants to comply with the earlier order for discovery made by Master Yuen, no order for discovery should be made against the4<sup>th</sup> defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  There is no merit in this submission.  When documents were voluntary supplied by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to the other defendants so as to enable them to comply with the order for discovery made against them, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant was not a party to the proceedings.  The obligation is on a party to make discovery.  The verification of documents byaffidavit was a duty that was personal to a party in an action and cannot be delegated (<i>Clauss v. Pir</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20Ch%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] Ch 267</a>; <i>Lau Chi Wang &amp; others v.

Category 1 consistsof sales and shipping documents under Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 15 and 16.  Category 2 consists of incorporation and company documents underItems 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 18.  Category 3 consists of correspondence under Items 11, 12, 13 and 17.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The Masterâs order was not drawn up.  I was informed that the Master made an order in terms of the summons except for Items 5,6 and 7.  The plaintiff did not pursue Item 5 before the Master.  I was also informed that at the hearing before the Master items6 and 7 were replaced and that an order requiring the disclosure of all documents and/or records held by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant revealing the beneficial and legal ownership of shares in the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant since its incorporation was made by the Master.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr. Shum accepted that sales documents, accounting records, and shipping documents in relation to die cast models purchased fromthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant are relevant.  These are under Items 1, 4, 13, 15 and 16.  He submitted that these should be restricted to production andsales of 1/18<sup>th</sup> scale model cars.  As regards Item 16, he submitted that documents issued to Davidson Ltd. are not relevant and not discoverable. This was because on the defendantsâ case the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant manufactured and sold these to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant until the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant ceased to manufacture the same for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant by the end of November 2000.  This was when the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs factory was sold as alleged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant at para. 17 of his affirmation filed on 17 April 2001.  It is the defendantâs case also that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has only manufactured 1/18<sup>th</sup> scale model cars for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.  The 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale and the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars were manufactured by Davidson Ltd. which operates a factory at Dongguan and the defendantâs case is that documentsin relation to these two scales are irrelevant and hence not discoverable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The defendantsâ case is also that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and the Gateway companies were set up by Jimmy Ibrahim also known as Jimmy Yee (âYeeâ) and not the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  It is denied that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and its subsidiaries were set up and operated to circumvent the contractual obligations of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants under the Agreement.  The defendantâs case is set out in the amended defence and the affirmations of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Yee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The defendantsâ case is contradicted by the evidence of Alain Morot-Gaudry (âMorot-Gaudryâ) contained in his affidavit filedon 3 September 2001 which supports the plaintiffâs case that the setting up of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and its subsidiaries including Gateway Europe was done by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the mastermind and that Yee had no involvement in the same.  Indeed the organizational charts and contact lists of keypeople in the organization sent to Morot-Gaudry and exhibited as part of Exhibit âSPD-4â to the affidavit of Seamus Patrick Doneganof 9 March 2001 does not even feature Yeeâs name there.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In my view the evidence filed on behalf of the plaintiff supports the plaintiffâs case that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and its subsidiaries were set up by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with a view to circumvent the contractual obligations of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants under the Agreement.  I need only refer to the following paragraphs in the affidavit of Morot-Gaudry :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â22.   I have read Yeeâs Affirmation very carefully.  There is no truth to Yeeâs claims of being behind Gateway.  The truthis that Gateway was established by Kwan with my help, Ms. Wilsonâs help, Ms. Yuenâs help and Schmadallaâs help for the solepurpose of getting around the agreement with the Plaintiff by creating a fake company structure to re-brand the U.T. products (todeprive the Plaintiff of its commission and exclusivity rights in Europe) and to compete head-on with the Plaintiff by producingthe same types of products for Gateway.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">23.    Complimenting our efforts at creating this structure, I was given the task of persuading American car manufacturers to shiftlicenses from U.T. to Gateway.  At the same time (May 1998), Nigel Gordon Stewart, based in the U.K. was given the task of persuadingthe European car manufacturers to shift their licenses to Gateway.  On later trips to these manufacturers, I attended together withMs. Wilson and Kwan.  The game we played was for Ms. Wilson to pretend to be the head of Gateway and for Kwan to simply be Gatewayâsmanufacturer.  In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.  Gateway was always Kwanâs company.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">24.    After we launched the Autoart and Gate ranges, I noticed that what Kwan had done was to use some U.T. tooling for making U.T.products, to instead produce identical products for Gate.  An example was the Porsche 911.  The only change made was to the cheapestpart to produce.  This is the plastic-base-plate underneath the model that resembles the chassis of a car.  Kwanâs factory simplychanged this piece to Gate instead of U.T. but it was the same product.  This was then sold in the U.S.A. by my company and in Europeby Schmadalla.  In this way, Kwan avoided to pay commission to the Plaintiff and also to sell directly into Germany and Belgium.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">25.    In fact, all matters relating to product lines for U.T., Gate and Autoart were decided by Kwan alone.  There are now producedand shown to me marked exhibit âAM-3â a bundle of emails and attached schedules issued by Kwan in October 1998 setting out hisplans for the future U.T., Gate and Autoart Programmes.  There are now shown to me and produced as exhibit marked âAM-3Aâ truecopies of two emails from Kwan and one email from me to Kwan all dated 1<sup>st</sup> October 1998 regarding licensing issues regarding a Corvette in which illustrate Kwanâs control over issues of which âcompanyâ(i.e. U.T. or Gateway) would produce which car.  It is obvious from these documents that Gateway was not just a customer of U.T.,rather it was another Kwan company.  I verily believe that Yee had absolutely nothing to do with the business.  These emails norany others I received or sent were ever copied to Yee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Kwan becomes âBillyâ and Yuen becomes âJamesâ</b>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">26.   Towards the end of 1998, Kwan became increasingly paranoid about hiding his connection to Gateway.  I understood that he wasso concerned because what we were all doing was designed to circumvent the agreement with the Plaintiff.  Accordingly, towards theend 1998, I was advised by Ms. Wilson that from now on U.T. people would use aliases in all emails and other correspondence.  I foundthis to be bizarre and frankly, a little-childish.  The aliases were as follows :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Kwan = Billy</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Yuen Ling Wan (Accountant at U.T.) = James Leigh</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Henry Tsang (Factory Manager of U.T.) = Patrick</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Man Tan (Research Engineer at U.T.) = Steve/Joey</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">27.   Ms. Wilson explained to me that Kwan did not want anything in writing to prove that he was running Gateway.  It was equallyimportant that Yuen Ling Wan should be camouflaged as well.  It will be seen from exhibit âAM-1â that Yuen Ling Wan was listedas Managing Director of Gateway Global Limited (Pacific).  In fact, Ms. Yuen was and always has been a U.T. employee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has admitted that he did use the alias Billy although no satisfactory explanation has been given for the use of the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As regards the Davidson Ltd. factory which produced the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale and the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, Morot-Gaudy also states that the Davidson Ltd. factory is operated by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and that he uses an ex-employee as his front man to give the appearance of disassociation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  These are obviously matters in issue between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It seems to me that the documents in relation to not just the 1/18<sup>th</sup> scale model cars produced by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but also the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale and 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars produced by Davidson Ltd. are relevant and discoverable.  I am unable to accept Mr. Shumâs submission that asfor items 1, 4, 13, 15, 16, only documents in relation to the 1/18<sup>th</sup> scale model cars but not in relation to the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale and the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars produced by Davidson Ltd. should be discoverable.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I am also unable to accept the submission that the request for discovery is solely for the purpose of impeaching the credit of the4<sup>th</sup> defendant and should be disallowed.  Mr. Shum relied on <i>George Ballantine &amp; Son v. F.E.R. Dixon &amp; Son</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20WLR%201125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 WLR 1125.</a>  That case is clearly distinguishable on its facts and provides no assistance to the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As Mr. Hingorani submitted, correctly in my view, under para. 16(k)(i) of the amended statement of claim it is pleaded that the1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant caused and/or procured the Production Facilities and âother factoriesâ to produce the die cast models.  It is alsopleaded in para. 16(n) that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants caused and/or procured the Production Facilities and âother factoriesâ to produce the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars and the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale model cars.  And at para. 16(o) it is pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant caused and/or procured the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to sell and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has sold the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale and the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale model cars for the purpose of eventual sale and/or distribution of the same by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in breach of the Agreement. The Davidson Ltd. factory which the defendants allege produced the 1/12<sup>th</sup> scale and the 1/43<sup>rd</sup> scale model cars would be included in the reference to âother factoriesâ in those paragraphs as well as in para. 17(c) wherethe tort of unlawful interference against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant is pleaded.  There is in my view an issue raised in respect of which discovery must be made.  It is not, as Mr. Shum alleged,discovery sought solely to impeach the credit of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.  I accept Mr. Hingoraniâs submissions and reject Mr. Shumâs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In my view the documents sought relate to questions in the action and which are clearly relevant. It is reasonable to suppose thatthey contain information which may enable the plaintiff either to advance his own case or to damage that of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants.  If is a document which may fairly lead the plaintiff to a train of inquiry which may have either of these two consequences,they must be disclosed (<i>Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re du Pacifique v. Peruvian Guano Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2011%20QBD%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 11 QBD 55).</a> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  As regards the incorporation and company documents under the replaced Items 6 and 7 as ordered by the Master, it seems to me thatthe incorporation and company documents are relevant in view of the allegations made.  It is the plaintiffâs case that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and each of the subsidiaries as pleaded in the amended statement of claim were set up by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  It is the 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs case that these were set up by Jimmy Yee and not the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  These are matters in issue between the parties and in my view there must be discovery as sought in respect of the replacedItems 6 and 7 and as ordered by the Master. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  There must also be discovery in respect of Items 8, 9 and 10.  I am also of the view that there should also be discovery in respectof Items 1 to 4, 11 to 13, 15 to 17 of the Schedule. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I do not think that an order should be made in respect of Item 14.  Yee has already stated on oath that documents under Item 14relating to the secondment of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs staff to work for the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendant do not exist.  The plaintiff is unable to show a <i>prima facie</i> case that these documents do exist and in my view there should not be an order to make discovery in relation to Item 14.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  As regards Item 18, it is the plaintiffâs case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant caused and/or procured the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and its subsidiaries to be set up as part of the course of conduct complained of. It is the 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs case that only some personnel from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant rendered assistance to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. The status of âBillyâ, Virgina Wilson, James Leigh and Patrick Cheng is a matter in question between the parties anddiscovery should be made of the documents requested.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  To conclude, I dismiss the appeal of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant but I vary the order of the Master by removing Item 14 from the Schedule.  The other parts of the order are to remain.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  As regards the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, its appeal is allowed.  The order made against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant is set aside.<i><br /></i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The appeal on costs</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On 16 February 2004 the Master ordered indemnity costs against the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants.  The plaintiff did not ask for indemnity costs but asked for costs to be taxed on a common fund basis and to be paidforthwith.  The reason for this is, as Mr. Hingorani submitted, was that there has been deliberate delay and obfuscation on the partof the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In view of my decision, the order for costs made against the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant cannot stand.  The order for costs made by the Master against it is set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Having considered the submissions of Counsel, I am not satisfied that this is a proper case to order costs against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant on a common fund basis rather than the usual party and party basis.  The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants resisted the application for discovery.  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant has failed but the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant has succeeded.  I am not satisfied that there are special or unusual features justifying an order for costs to be taxedon a common fund basis. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The Masterâs order for costs against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant on an indemnity basis is set aside and is to be replaced by an order that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant do pay the plaintiff its costs of the application such costs to be taxed on a party and party basis and to be paid forthwith.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The plaintiff has substantially succeeded against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant on the appeals.  I make an order <i>nisi</i> for the costs of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs appeals to be costs to the plaintiff such costs to be taxed on a party and party basis and to be paid by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant forthwith.  I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant its costs of the appeals and of the application before the Master such costs also to be taxed on a party and party basisand to be paid forthwith.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
