There was an appeal fromthat judgment and order to the Court of Appeal. The court upheld my assessment of the witnesses and dismissed the appeal on the claim.The appeal in respect of the counterclaim, in which I held that the plaintiff had been guilty of the tort of malicious prosecution,was successful as to quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  What has now happened is that the plaintiff is applying to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. There is a point here that perhaps needs to be made that the appeal in respect of the claim, which is for a liquidated sum of $17.8million, will be an appeal as of right although of course the Court of Appeal acts very much as a filter and the court will decideon what particular grounds that appeal should proceed to the Court of Final Appeal. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff is also seeking leave to appeal, which she requires, in respect of the counterclaim.  All of this is going to comeup for hearing on 1 November, so in just over two monthsâ time.  There is also a summons taken out by the plaintiff before theCourt of Appeal for a stay of execution and I think also the continuation of the Mareva injunction.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Today, these summons are taken out by the now twice successful defendant for the following orders: firstly, that the amount of moneythat I ordered to be paid into court by the plaintiff as a condition for having given her leave to appeal should be paid out; secondly,that a <i>lis pendens</i> in respect of the defendantâs home which he shares with his wife should now be removed; thirdly, that the Mareva injunction grantedas long ago as 26 October 2007 - so we are coming up to four years now - as continued by me on 2 November 2010 and further continuedon 5 January 2011 should be discharged and that there should be an inquiry as to damages; and, lastly, that the stay of executionon the judgment on the counterclaim should now be lifted.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The defendant starts from a very advantageous position because, as I have already observed, he has been successful at first instanceon findings of fact, which findings have now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and so it is the case, and I think I can put itstrongly as this, that it is very difficult in such circumstances to disturb concurrent findings of fact before the Final Court ofAppeal.  Nevertheless, it is an appeal which is one that is brought as of right. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The concern which Mr Lau, on behalf of the plaintiff, has raised is that if I accede to these applications, these four summonses,and if the plaintiff were eventually to be successful, there simply would be nothing for her to have by way of assets belonging tothe defendant which she would be able to enforce on, and that is a fair point.  It is right to say that the defendant on his ownevidence admitted quite frankly before me that he had got through all of the $17.8 million which the plaintiff had given him.  Andthere is that risk, but of course Mr Chu says that this does not really matter because one has to, first of all, consider what theprospects of a successful appeal are in these circumstances. The prospects of success essentially must now, if I may respectfullysay so, be for the Court of Appeal to decide when it hears the notice of motion on 1 November, but I have observed, and I think Iam entitled to observe, that this would be an appeal against concurrent findings of fact by myself and by the Court of Appeal.  </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  This is not an easy decision today.  The law is that a <i>Mareva</i> injunction, which is essentially an order to hold the ring until the trial at first instance is one that can be extended, as I have,pending the hearing of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, but now that appeal has gone and it has gone against the plaintiff andso Mr Chu is undoubtedly on strong ground in respect of this in saying, âWell, the injunction should at least be discharged asshould the <i>lis pendens</i>.â  This is a delicate balancing exercise for me today.  That is the way I view this matter and I have decided, just about, to adjournall four summonses to 15 November which, as I say, is just over two months away, to await the outcome of the plaintiffâs applicationsto be heard by the Court of Appeal on 1 November.   </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the light of the Court of Appealâs decision, I will then be far better equipped, it seems to me, to deal with these summonses. So I am going to adjourn to that date at half past 9. The costs of today will be costs in the four summonses.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Ian Carlson)<br />Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>	<!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Bruce Lau, instructed by Messrs Anthony Kwan &amp; Co. for the Plaintiff</p>    <p>George Chu, instructed by Messrs Michael Pang &amp; Co. for the Defendant</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/614.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
