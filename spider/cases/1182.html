The degree of control to be exercised by the plaintiff is perhaps best illustratedby a requirement that the franchise holder shall comply "with the instructions of the 'Betriebshandbuch' (operating manual) and anyamendments thereto" and an undertaking that he shall "serve mainly the dishes specified" in it but "shall be free to serve, in addition,to suit regional require-ments, other beverages (not exceeding five) and dishes (not exceeding five)". Notwithstanding these andother requirements as to the manner in which the restaurants are to be run the number to be run in each territory and the periodswithin which they are to be established it is provided that the franchise holder shall own the various restaurants to be operatedunder the agreement and "shall run all restaurants for his own account. For this purpose, he shall form a separate company in suchcorporate form as he may chose but which shall not in its name incorporate or make reference to the name 'Wienerwald' or its abbreviation'WW'." He is to pay a lump sum in respect of each restaurant opened and a "royalty" based on gross sales.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I have dealt in some detail with the terms of this "standard form of franchise agreement" because two facts become clear from them.Firstly that it is not the present intention of the plaintiff by itself or its subsidiary to own or run restaurants in Hong Kong:the intention is rather that a Mr. Jentes shall do so "for his own account". Secondly the plaintiff has an immediate and pressinginterest in all details of the operation of the restaurants. On termination by effluxion of time or otherwise of the agreement thefranchise holder "undertakes to cease using any rights granted to him" to dismantle signs or emblems and "remove from all of thepremises all matters which may designate such premises as having a connection with" the plaintiff. What however is not covered bythe agreement is such goodwill as may have been built up by the franchise holder by his personal efforts which subject to the undertakingsI have mentioned is the property of the franchise holder. He trades on his own account and becomes entitled to any goodwill earnedalthough no longer entitled to suggest the existence of a connection with the plaintiff. The plaintiff by the terms of the agreementhas no interest in any goodwill that the franchise holder may build up other than in the name, trade marks and 'trappings' to beused. The independence of the plaintiff is the subject of express stipulation in the standard form.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Consequent upon the plaintiff having entered into the franchise agreement with Mr. Jentes its solicitors wrote to the Registrar ofCompanies on 17th October 1978 requesting him to let them know if the name "Wienerwald Ltd." is available for registration as a privatecompany "if such is not available, please advise whether the name 'Wienerwald Restaurant Ltd.' can be registered". A fee of $40 wasenclosed. I should mention that this course is permitted by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s20a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 20A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>) which also provides for the reservation of names for future registration for periods up to 3 months. The Registrar of Companiesadvised that neither name was registrable they "being identical with or resembling the registered or reserved company name(s), detailsof which are set out hereunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Section 20(1))</a> "sic"): - Wienerwald German-Style Restaurant Ltd. and Wienerwald Restaurant Ltd. names reserved for Messrs. Kwan Wong Tan &amp; Fong"(the defendants) "up to 6.12.78". On the 29th November 1978 the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of Companies givinga brief history of the plaintiff and its operations and urging him not to "accept for for registration a company with the name ofWienerwald Ltd. or Wienerwald German Style Restaurant Ltd. or Wienerwald Restaurant Ltd. except to those who are entitled to useof such name. Also we trust that if no company has been submitted with such name prior to the expiry of the time reserved, no extensionwill be allowed by you." They wrote further to this letter on the 2nd December 1978 enclosing documentary evidence of the plaintiff'sinternational repute and apparently having received no reply by the 15th December 1978 wrote again asking if an extension had beensought by the defendants. This letter was apparently crossed by a letter of the 12th December 1978 from the Registrar of Companiesreading:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Dear Sirs,</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">Re:</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote">(A) Wienerwald Limited</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="76%" class="quote"><u>(B) Wienerwald Restaurant Limited</u></td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" height="21" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" height="21" class="quote">          I refer to your letter of the 29th November 1978.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" height="40" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" height="40" class="quote">          I note that you have asked us not to reserve a name for a proposed company similar to 'Wienerwald Limited' or 'WienerwaldRestaurant Limited'.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" height="59" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" height="59" class="quote">          As you are aware under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.20</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> I only have power to refuse a name where such name is identical with that by which a company is already registered or identical withthat of a company incorporated outside the Colony which has complied with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part XI</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" height="40" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="90%" height="40" class="quote">          At the date of the application made by Messrs.

However the Registrar is not a partyto these proceedings and the questions have not been canvassed. Equally the nature of the statutory duty to register has not. Inthe circumstances I consider that I must, for the purposes of this application, assume that the Registrar has acted correctly throughout.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff has never carried on business in Hong Kong nor indeed anywhere in the Far East. In Japan there are Wienerwald Restaurantscarried on not by the plaintiff but by some company or companies enjoying a franchise similar to that previously outlined. It hasengaged in no advertising here; such advertising as has come to the attention of the public in Hong Kong having come through Germanor other continental publications of which I have no details which have an international circulation or such advertising abroad ashas come to the attention of the public here who have travelled abroad. The plaintiff has on the issue of local reputation filed4 affidavits; each of these is by a European of Continental origin who has enjoyed prolonged residence here and who has travelledregularly in Europe; each avers that if he heard of a restaurant in Hongkong under the name "Wienerwald" he would at once think itwas connected with the Wienerwald Restaurants in Europe. He would think it was "a further extension of the already existing chain"... "directly connected with the organisation owning and running the restaurants in Europe". I do not consider that the plaintiffhas established that there is a triable issue that it enjoys a reputation in Hong Kong in the minds of any sector of its residentsother than this necessarily small but growing sector. In saying this I do not overlook the extensions that have been made to thechain constantly over the last quarter century nor the fact that it is part of the business of the plaintiff to grant franchisesoutside Europe which are presumably highly remunerative to them and that it proposes to grant such franchises throughout the territoriesin the Far East previously listed. These factors although they are clearly of great importance to the plaintiff and affect what Iwill call its "international reputation" do not save most indirectly effect its reputation in Hong Kong. I am of the view that theplaintiff has not shown that there is a question to be tried on the issue as to whether the plaintiff has acquired a reputation amonga significant segment of the population of Hong Kong. The proportion of those to whom I refer for the sake of brevity as "ContinentalEuropeans" to our population as a whole must be exceedingly small. I should be surprised if it numbered more than .2%. I do not loosesight of the fact that this small minority may be both affluent and able and by reason of position and education may play a partin our society wholly disproportionate to their number nor of the fact that by reason of their cultural and cultivated backgroundsthey number among them many whom a restaurant owner would be proud to find among his clientele. Equally I do not loose sight of thefact that the defendants have offered no explanation for the choice of the name "Wienerwald". It is I consider a reasonable assumptionthat the choice was motivated by a knowledge of the international reputation of the plaintiff's brainchild. That choice, however,does not appear to have been the choice of the defendants who are a local firm of chartered accountants. It is the choice of theirforeign undisclosed principal in Singapore. It does not spring from Hong Kong reputation. On the other hand I have no doubt but thatthe plaintiff has established that there is a triable issue that it enjoys an international reputation which has not yet penetratedto a significant extent to Hong Kong but which anyone would anticipate they would eventually seek to exploit here. The graph of theprogress of that reputation could readily be extrapolated. Mr. Jahn the original founder started his first restaurant in Munich in1955. By 1958 a firm of which he was a member owned 5 restaurants. He set up the plaintiff company in 1962 in Switzerland. It setup Wienerwald Gmbtt in Munich in 1963 in which 137 restaurants which by then existed in Germany were vested. Restaurants had beencommenced in Switzerland, Austria and Belgium in 1962 were commenced in the Netherlands in 1965 in the U.S.A. in 1966 in Italy in 1968, in France in 1969 and in Lichtenstein in 1975.Meanwhile in 1973 the plaintiff had granted a franchise to an operator in Japan, in 1975 to one in South Africa and in 1976 to operatorsin Spain and South West Africa. It was inevitable that it should in the natural course of events seek to penetrate the various territoriesin the Far East listed in the "standard form of franchise" to which I have earlier referred. It is on this basis that I must considerwhether the plaintiff has established the existence of a triable issue that of necessity being whether the plaintiff's internationalreputation can be protected here when it has not <u>as yet</u> acquired here "a local habitation and a name"? I emphasize the words "as yet" because I view with disquiet the notion that one businessmanor company seeing the successful progress achieved internationally by another under a particular name may with impunity interruptthat progress by the registration locally of a company bearing that name without proffering any reason for his choice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> At the outset of my consideration of this I would say that I share the view expressed (obiter) by Kenny, J. in the Supreme Courtof Ireland that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the idea that some of the goodwill must be acquired by user or trading in the country where it is sought to protect it comes fromthe days when television and radio were unknown and when international trade in domestic goods was not as extensive as it is today.It is not an appropriate rule for this age ....".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">What I have to decide as a judge and not as a legislator is whether there is an arguable case that the law of passing off may be soextended as to give protection to goodwill acquired internationally but not at the time of action acquired here. In the case fromwhich this quotation arises Henchy, J. notes<sup>(1)</sup>:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">The name and symbol 'C &amp; A' were not chosen through any bona fido coincidence or mischance. They were plainly chosen with theintention that members of the public would be confused into thinking that the goods or business of the defendant companies emanatedfrom the C &amp; A ambience. When the individual defendants were sent a letter of complaint, they, as the sole directors and shareholdersof the defendant companies, had an opportunity of asserting an innocent or harmless purpose in the conduct complained of. They didnot do so. Instead, they claimed a right to do what was complained of because neither of the plaintiff companies was trading in thisState. They allowed to go by default the complaint that their conduct was calculated to deceive members of the public. In those circumstancesthe judge was fully justified in finding an intention to deceive. While that mental element is not of the essence of the cause ofaction, it shows that the conduct complained of was in fact likely to deceive - which goes to the gist of the action for passingoff.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          It is, of course, correct to say, as counsel for the defendants say, that even where conduct likely to deceive is provedthe plaintiffs cannot succeed unless they show that their goodwill is at least imperilled by that conduct. Here it is contended thatthere was no reach of the plaintiffs' goodwill which could be affected by the defendants' conduct. The plaintiffs have no shop orplace of trading within the State, and it is urged that the evidence fell short of showing that the orbit of their trading activitiesoutside the State was capable of carrying with it a public awareness within the State of the import of 'C &amp; A' as a businessname or symbol, and that, consequently, the defendants' conduct was incapable of invading their goodwill.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          Consider this submission in the light of the evidence. Sixty-five shops throughout the United Kingdom, including the onein Belfast, purvey the distinctive C &amp; A. wearing apparel. It would be remarkable, considering the movement of people betweenthis State and the United Kingdom, if there were not a significant number of at least intermittent C &amp; A customers in this State.The evidence also showed that there has been massive advertising of C &amp; A goods on television and in some of the most widelyread British newspapers and magazines circulating in the Republic of Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland newspapers. The Belfastshop draws a not inconsiderable number of its customers from the Republic. The C &amp; A organisation recruits staff from the Republic.In 1975, one factory in Cork manufactured 850,000 items which were sold in the C &amp; A shops.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          Can it be said in these circumstances that, because the plaintiffs have no direct retailing outlet in the Republic, theyhave no protectable goodwill in the Republic? In my opinion, the answer is 'No'. Goodwill does not necessarily stop at a frontier.Whether in a particular area a plaintiff has a goodwill which is liable to be damaged by the unlawful competition resulting frompassing off is a question of fact and of degree. What has to be established for the suceess of a plaintiff's claim in an action suchas this is that by his business activities - be they by direct selling within the State or otherwise - he has generated within theState a property right in a goodwill which will be violated by the passing-off. It is true that there is authority for the propositionthat a plaintiff's reputation which owes nothing to user in this State is not sufficient to support a passing-off action (<u>Alain Bernardin et Cie v. Pavilion Properties Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20RPC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) R.P.C. 581)</a> but, as is stated in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (10th ed., p.386), it is difficult to see any rational basis forthis distinction. If there are in this State sufficient customers of a plaintiff's business to justify his claim to have a vestedright to retain and expand that custom, then there is ample authority in principle and in the decided cases for the conclusion that,no matter where the plaintiff's business is based, he is entitled to be protected against its being taken away or dissipated by someonewhose deceptive conduct is calculated to create a confusion of identity in the minds of existing or potential customers.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          I consider that the evidence in this case amply satisfies the test. The nature and spread of the C &amp; A trade throughoutthe United Kingdom, the extent to which the shop in Belfast draws its custom from this State, the advertising campaign in papersand magazines circulating here, the distinctive nature of C &amp; A goods in their labelling and packaging and in the C &amp; A symbol,all these in combination point to a goodwill in this State. If there were any doubt that the first plaintiffs enjoy in this State'the attractive force which brings in custom' (per Lord Managhten <u>in Commissioner of Inland Revenue</u> v. <u>Muller &amp; Co. 's Margarine Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%20AC%20217" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) A.C. 217</a>, 224), one might ask why did the individual defendants purloin the name and symbol of C &amp; A? The answer is that they did so togain commercial advantage from the resulting confusion in the public mind between their trading activities and those of the firstplaintiffs. Their passing off was calculated to operate to the detriment of the goodwill in this State of the first plaintiffs. Itis to prevent unfair competition of that kind that the action for passing off lies."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> These passages read in their entirety appeal to me and I accept them so read with great respect as an exegesis of the Common Law.Read in context the sentence "goodwill does not necessarily stop at a frontier" is not to be taken as meaning that "goodwill knowsno frontiers". Clearly, Henchy, J. did not so intend it. The sentences following with their references to a "particular area", "degree"and "generated within the State" make any argument that the sentence could be so meant untenable. I pause to remark that Henchy,J. apparently would be prepared to take a step which I feared to take in O.J. Action No. 1613 (unreported) when I sympathised withcounsel's refusal to rely on the confusion which might arise in the minds of visitors to the Colony and said "I think he is rightin the present state of the law's development. The confusion caused in their minds is damage to the goodwill which the plaintiffhas built up in the U.S.rather than here." Henchy, J. is prepared to have regard to "intermittent customers". This robust view Iwould now be prepared to accept provided the presence of such "intermittent customers" was coupled with other factors to show theacquisition of local goodwill. (I trust I will be pardoned a digression if I remark that such robustness is to be anticipated inone so deeply read as is Henchy, J. in Celtic law and lore. Strong views as to copyright, the step-sister of passing off, datingfrom the 7th or 8th century are to be found there, enshrined in the pithy maxim "to every cow, its calf.")</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In all the decided cases to which I have been referred in which interlocutory or final injunctions were granted the question whetherthe party seeking relief enjoyed goodwill and reputation in the country in which relief was sought was implicitly or explicitly regardedas fundamental. <u>Maxim's Ltd. &amp; Anor</u>. v. <u>Dve</u><sup>(2)</sup> comes most readily to mind because it too concerned a restaurant and seems to me to approach a boundary not easy to pass. In thatcase the plaintiff company owned a restaurant in Paris known as 'Maxims'. It was well known in England and extensively patronisedby persons resident in England. The defendant opened a restaurant in Norwich decorated in "period French style". In an applicationfor judgment in default of defence the primary question for resolution was whether there was a requirement of English law that aplaintiff must have traded in England in order to succeed. It was held that it need not and that the geographical extent of a businessgoodwill was a question of fact, a business could have goodwill based on trading abroad. In that case, Graham, J. in granting reliefrefused to follow the <u>Crazy Horse Case</u><sup>(3)</sup> as incompatible with the law of the E.E.C.

If he intends so to lead I would not feel able to follow much as I might like to do so. The casecertainly does not decide that a plaintiff may succeed in interlocutory proceedings without establishing a triable issue on the questionas to whether there is an existing goodwill. It will further be noted that its facts are a far cry from those in the present casefor here the four affidavits as to reputation go little further than to establish that a small segment of our population knows ofthe plaintiff's business abroad. No one avers that he has been inside one of the plaintiff's restaurants or that anyone from HongKong has or even that he knows what they are like.

Lord Parker said that to do so is treated as an invasion of a right. In anysuch case he who complains of passing off must establish that the use by the defendant in connection with his goods of a particularname, mark or get-up impliedly represents such goods to be the plaintiff's.

The more general opinion appears to be that the right is a right of property. This view naturallydemands an answer to the question - property in what? Some authorities say property in the mark, name or get-up improperly used bythe defendant. Others say, property in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation. Lord Hershell, in<u>Reddawav</u> v. <u>Banham</u> ((1896) A.C. 199) expressly dissents from the former view; and if the right invaded is a right of property at all, there are, I think,strong reasons for preferring the latter view'.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">I would respectfully accept and adopt this view. When a member of the public purchases goods on the market believing them to be thegoods of A, it is A's goods that he wants, not the name, mark or get-up, which is no more than a label or badge which signifies thatthe goods are A's goods. It is the reputation of the goods that matters : it is the association of the name, mark or get-up withthose goods, distinguishing them from other men's goods, which makes the name, mark or get-up important, serving as a vehicle ofthe information that the goods are goods of the kind which has the reputation.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          What is of value to A in his trade or business is his ability to attract customers in the market. This depends upon thereputation of the commodity in which he deals. It is this reputation which in a passing off action he is seeking to protect, notany right of property in a name, mark or get-up."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">It follows from this that it is not the name "Wienerwald" that is to be protected and that the reputation to be protected is reputationalready existing in this Colony albeit that reputation may be acquired here even when no business is carried on here.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In this case the plaintiff has failed to show me that there is a triable issue as to whether there is at present any goodwill inthe Colony attaching to the name "Wienerwald" to the initials "WW" or to the notion of a Wienerwald restaurant. It is only such goodwillcan be protected in a passing off action. Having decided that, it is unnecessary for me to consider the complications arising fromthe proposed franchise agreement. Under it any goodwill attaching to any business set up that is not conferred by the "Wienerwald"name and "trappings" that are the subject of franchise belongs to the franchise holder but the trappings remain subject to the controlof the plaintiff. It has an asset that might be of considerable value if Wienerwald became known here and I would be prepared, ifthere were any cogent evidence of goodwill already existing in this jurisdiction to hold that that asset could be protected in apassing off action. As I see it what cannot be protected in passing off is a goodwill existing elsewhere which has not yet penetratedto this jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I would say in closing that I think this a lamentable conclusion at which I find myself compelled to arrive on the evidence.
