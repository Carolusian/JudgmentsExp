She left the defendant to work for another insurancecompany as agent cum manager.  Seven agents previously working under her also left the defendant to work under her in the new insurancecompany at the same time. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Before leaving the defendant, she had resigned by given one monthâs prior notice to the defendant.  Before the expiry of the noticeperiod, the defendant dismissed her on the ground that she was in breach of her agentâs and managerâs agreements with the defendantby soliciting, enticing, inducing and/or encouraging some of seven agents working under her to leave the defendant to work underher in the new insurance company.  The defendant relied on such breach of those agreements to deny her certain commission, bonus,allowances, remuneration.  She claimed against the defendant such items and alternatively damages. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Before the master, the defendant took out a summons for specific discovery of 2 classes of documents:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">1. Documents in relation to the plaintiffâs terms of appointment as agent of AIA including, but not limited to, the agency contract,any letter of offer of agency, any letter of acceptance of agency, notes of conversations between the plaintiff and any member ofAIA in relation to the terms of the plaintiffâs appointment as agent; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">2. Documents in relation to the structure of the plaintiffâs team of agents at AIA which identify the agents either directly orindirectly under the plaintiffâs supervision.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The master dismissed the defendantâs summons with costs to the plaintiff.  The defendant appealed to me but only in respect ofthe second class of documents.  In the course of the hearing before me, the defendant applies for leave to amend, so as to narrowdown the scope of, the second class of documents.  The plaintiff raises no objection.  I grant the plaintiff leave to do so. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The amended class of documents is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">Documents in relation to the structure of the plaintiffâs team of agents at AIA (in the period between 11 April 2003 and 31 July2003, both dates inclusive) which identify any of the agents referred to in paragraph 10(ii) to (viii) of the Amended Defence aseither directly or indirectly under the plaintiffâs supervision.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The party seeking the order has to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)   There is in existence a specific document or class of documents;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)   The plaintiff has or had the document in her possession, custody or power;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)   The document or class of documents relates to a matter in question;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4)   Discovery is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter of for saving costs.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">[see <i>Lee Nui Foon v Ocean Park Corp (No 1)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 390</a>, at 391 â 392, per Cheung J (as he then was )] </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(1)   That there is in existence a specific document or class of documents; and (2) that the plaintiff has or had the document inher possession, custody or power</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Yi Man-wai in her first affirmation of [para 11 at p. 64] stated, inter alia, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i) According to the information derived from the Hong Kong Federation of Insurersâ website, the plaintiff has been registered asan insurance agent of AIA since 28 May 2003;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(ii) According to the information derived from the Hong Kong Federation of Insurersâ website, the seven agents in question havebeen registered as insurance agents of AIA since 28 or 30 May 2003, i.e., from the same date as the plaintiff or 2 days thereafter;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â¦..</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(iv)      An international company such as AIA will maintain organizational charts of sales teams and list the identities of teammembers.

I have putin the words âeither directly or indirectly,â because, as it seems to me, a document can properly be said to contain informationwhich may enable the party requiring [it] to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, if it is a document whichmay fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two consequences. </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> On the status of the applying partyâs pleaded case in a discovery application, in <i>Format Communications v ITT Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20FSR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] FSR 473</a>, 477 Slade L.J. agreed with the submission that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">for the purpose of testing the materiality of discovery â¦.. it is the case of the party seeking the discovery â¦.. that must beassumed to be true and not that of the party against whom discovery is sought â¦..</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In our present case, the defendant pleaded [in Amended Defence para 10, p. 23] as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">[I]t is averred that the plaintiff breached her [Agency Agreement and her Managerâs Agreement] with the defendant by soliciting,enticing, inducing and/or encouraging some of the defendantâs agents, who had been directly under the supervision of the plaintiff,to resign from their position with the defendant with the sole purpose of joining the plaintiff at her new place of employment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thereafter came the dates and circumstances of the seven agents thereby induced. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Counsel for the respondent in this appeal argues that there could not be a case of inducement because there was no evidence thatany of those seven agents were so induced by the plaintiff.  He relies on the case of <i>Deacons v White &amp; Case Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKLRD%20670" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003]</i> 3 HKLRD 670.</a>  In that case, the issue for the trial judge was whether the defendants had committed the tort of inducing their team-members inthe same solicitorsâ firm, to leave in concert or the team-members left of their own accord.  Deputy Judge Gill, on the facts beforehim, found that there was no inducement.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> I do not see how the rationale behind that case is applicable to our present case.  As Slade L.J. in <i>Format Communications v ITT Ltd.  (supra)</i> had said, the pleaded defence case was one of inducement.  We must assume, for the purpose of this discovery application, it to bethe true.  This is no room for this Court at this juncture to make a ruling, as was incumbent upon the trial judge in <i>Deacons v White &amp; Case Ltd (supra)</i>, that inducement was a plea rejected by the Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> It is obvious that the class of documents sought by the defendant here would assist its case or damage the plaintiffâs case onthe issue of inducement, an alleged act in breach of the agreements. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> I give judgment to the defendant on this appeal in terms of the amended class of documents sought in paragraph 2 under the scheduleof the summons.  I set aside the masterâs order.  The parties have informed me in advance that in any event, some editing has tobe done to block out data unrelated to our present case.  They have requested for an order for liberty to apply before me in casethat they should disagree on the extent of the editing.  I do make this order now. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> I make an order <i>nisi</i> for the defendant to have costs of this appeal, with certificate for counsel, but no order as to costs in the hearing before themaster.  This costs order shall become absolute after 14 days from today.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">SIGNED<br />            (Eddie Yip)<br />            Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>   </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">The Plaintiff: represented by Mr. Herbert Au-yeung instructed by Messrs.
