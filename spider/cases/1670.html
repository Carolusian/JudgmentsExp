The plaintiff ship-owners now appeal to this court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The ship-owners entered into a ship repair agreement with the defendant deck company. In the events which have happened it was anagreement for two years from 10th August 1969. The principal terms governing the number of ships to be repaired and various discountsor credits which were to be allowed in specified circumstances were contained in what has been described as "the Master Agreement".Clause 6 of that Agreement reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Dockyard's Standard Conditions 'A' or 'B' as attached, to apply during the whole period of this Agreement unless specificallyamended by the terms of this Agreement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The two sets of Standard Conditions were indeed annexed and they are headed respectively -</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"A":</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">"Governing repairs where no tender is submitted".</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"B":</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">"Governing repairs pursuant to tenders".</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The "B" Conditions contain a clause which reads in part:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Any dispute shall be determined by arbitration",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">but the "A" Conditions contain no such clause.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Within the period of the Master Agreement the ship-owners asked the dock company for an estimate of the cost of effecting specifiedrepairs to their vessel "E1 Jigue". The dock company in reply supplied what they described as a "tender" for the work. It was nota tender in the sense (to quote from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary) of</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"an offer made in writing by one party to another .... to execute, at an inclusive price or uniform rate, an order for the supplyor purchase of goods, or for the execution of work, the details of which have been submitted by the second party",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">because for many of the items of work only approximate figures were given - sometimes with the addition of the words "for budgettingpurposes only" - and in some instances the notation was "price after examination". The dock company contend that the document wasnevertheless a "tender" of the kind contemplated by the parties in their Agreement and the ship-owners accept that, the case havingbeen argued in chambers on that basis, it is not open to them to suggest otherwise in this court. Again, at least for the purposesof this appeal, both parties expressly accept that on the true construction of clause 6 of the Master Agreement Conditions "A" and"B" are exhaustive, i.e. that all repairs carried out by the dock company to the ship-owners' vessels are governed by one or theother.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> There is no evidence of any further communication between the parties before, on 31st March 1971, the "E1 Jigue" entered the dockcompany's dock. It is reasonable to assume that there were communications of a purely administrative nature, but we are told of nothingwhich could be construed as an acceptance or rejection of the "tender". While the vessel was in the dockyard two things happened:first, in addition to work covered by the "tender" a large amount of other work was carried out, for which the dock company chargeda sum in excess of the total price for the works covered by the "tender", and, second, a fire broke out on board which resulted inextensive damage, that damage being the basis of the ship-owners' claim in the action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The ship-owners submit that the learned Chief Justice was in error in finding on the evidence that the "tender" had been acceptedso as to bring into operation the arbitration clause in the "B" Conditions. Unfortunately we do not have the advantage of any writtenreasons for the decisions below, but an agreed note of the decision in the judge's chambers reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="8%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">The acceptance of the tender is proved by the words of the tender and the work done under the tender, although there was extra workdone too.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">          There was a vast price difference but this was nothing new in the commercial world".</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">I understand that to mean that there was what has been contended for by the dock company - an acceptance by conduct: by presentingthe ship at the dockyard, apparently for (inter alia) the very repairs specified in the "tender", the ship-owners indicated (in theabsence of any express acceptance or rejection of the "tender") that they were accepting. Mr. Ching argues that this is not sufficientevidence of acceptance because (he says) not only might there have been another agreement but the extent of the additional work chargedfor makes it probable that there was another agreement, which would constitute a counter-offer and a rejection of the "tender". Heemphasizes that the burden of proof is on the dock company - and that is conceded. I agree that the evidence of acceptance was sparsebut in my view it was sufficient to transfer to the ship-owners the evidential burden, a burden which they could so easily have dischargedif in fact there had been a rejection of the "tender". The learned Chief Justice had to decide the case on the evidence before himand I do not think his findings can be successfully attacked.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Next it is submitted that even if the arbitration clause was operative the dock company have not sufficiently identified the disputewhich is to be referred to arbitration and, even if they have, that they have not shown that that dispute is within the ambit ofthe arbitration clause. At an early stage the solicitors for the dock company asked for particulars of the Statement of Claim andlater threatened to apply for an order if the particulars were not given voluntarily. The solicitors for the ship-owners on 5th May1976 gave notice that they required a Defence to be filed and six days later formally refused to give the particulars sought or toagree to a submission to arbitration. What Mr. Ching says here is that if the particulars were really necessary to enable the dockcompany to file their Defence the dispute cannot have been sufficiently identified and once again, the burden was on them to showwhat the dispute was. I suspect that there was a certain amount of tactical manoeuvring going on but, be that as it may, the dockcompany never said they could not identify the dispute which would be referred to the arbitrator if the decision to arbitrate cameto be made: what they said was that they wished to have the particulars before deciding whether to insist on arbitration. Until theyfiled their Defence or a reference was made the exact issues might not be known, but the general nature of the dispute was in myview clear enough.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Was that dispute within the ambit of the arbitration clause? The substance of the contention on behalf of the ship-owners is thatthe "B" Conditions, assuming they governed some of the work, had not been shown to apply to such dispute as had been disclosed. Mr.Ching submits that the "B" Conditions would at most apply to events arising from the carrying out of the repairs covered by the "tender"and that any additional work would be governed by the "A" Conditions: it was therefore for the dock company to show that the disputearose out of the former repairs. This argument appears to be consonant with the headings to the two sets of Conditions when theyare considered in isolation, because it does not necessarily follow from the fact that a tender has been submitted (even if accepted)that all repairs done must be "pursuant to" that tender. However, the concession which was made, that all repairs must be governedby one set of Conditions or the other, shows that too much weight should not be attached to the strict meanings of the headings themselves.Mr. Ching points to a number of the "B" Conditions and in particular to clause 7, which expressly states that the "B" Conditionsshall apply to "replacements" of work carried out and subsequently destroyed or damaged. From this it is suggested that the partieshave, where they desired that the "B" Conditions should apply to other than the specified repairs, expressly so stated. Mr. Evans,on the other hand, relies heavily on clause 4, which is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Any work done, material supplied, services rendered or charges incurred by the Contractor which are not expressly included in thetender will be charged separately and at the Contractor's tariff rates where applicable".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He argues that this provides that extra works shall be treated on the same footing as the specified repairs and that, though chargeableat tariff rates, they are thus brought under the heading "Repairs pursuant to Tenders". He further says that clause 6(ii) clearlyrecognizes that sums may be payable under the "B" Conditions which are different from "the price quoted": such amounts must be forthe extra works. In clause 4 the use of the word "expressly" shows that there may be work done which is not expressly included inthe "tender" and which will be charged separately, but the clause does not say that such work shall not be governed by the "B" Conditions.However, the extra works there referred to may be no more than those specifically mentioned in clause 1, which reads in part:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The tender covers and includes the work herein specified and all specified removals in connection therewith. The removals must, savewhere otherwise specified, be replaced, but any removals and renewals not detailed in the specification will be treated as extrasexcepting renewals of previously sound parts which have clearly been broken or damaged by the Contractor's workmen or workmen ofany Sub-contractor."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In so far as extra works were "unspecified removals in connection therewith" they would clearly be "pursuant to" the tender and itseems to me that any extra works (including such "unspecified renewals" as are chargeable) could similarly be "pursuant to" the tender- at least so long as the specified repairs remained the substantial reason for the entry of the vessel into the dock company's dockyard.Mr. Evans submits that the scope of the contract is wider than the scope of the "tender". By that, as I understand him, he meansnot that the extra works are not "pursuant to" the "tender" but merely that they are not specified in the "tender" and it mattersnot that on one possible interpretation of clause 1 the "tender" covers and includes <u>only</u> the specified work, the specified removals and the unspecified removals. If Mr. Ching's argument is correct, then, on the agreedbasis that the "A" or the "B" Conditions must govern all repairs undertaken by the dock company for the ship-owners, it follows thatwhere repairs specified in a "tender" are done at the same time as other repairs not so specified both sets of Conditions will applyat one and the same time. In this connection clause 1 of the "A" Conditions is relevant and this reads in part:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The placing of an order, oral or written, with the Contractor shall constitute acceptance of these Conditions which shall governall work done or services rendered by the Contractor, save where a formal tender is submitted where the terms thereof shall prevail."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Again it may be argued that this is capable of two interpretations, either that where the terms of the formal tender prevail the "A"Conditions shall not apply at all or that the terms of the formal tender shall prevail only in so far as the work done is specifiedin the formal tender. Seeing that there is this ambiguity, I think it would be highly inconvenient that both sets of Conditions shouldapply at one and the same time and such a result is unlikely to have been intended by the parties. Suppose a fire resulted from adefective electric cable supplying power at the same moment of time for specified repairs and for unspecified repairs. If both setsof Conditions applied, a dispute as to liability for negligence would be arbitrable under one but not under the other. The more naturalmeaning of clause 6 of the Master Agreement and of the relevant clauses of the two sets of Conditions seems to me to be that onlyone set of Conditions is to apply at any one time in respect of any one vessel. Mr. Ching has suggested that where there is any doubtwhether there has been an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration the judge should exercise his discretion against a stay, andhe cites <u>London Sack and Bag Co. Ltd.</u> v <u>Dixon and Lugton Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1943%202%20All%20ER%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1943 2 All E.R. 763.</a> However, as Buckley, L.J., said in <u>Modern Building Wales Ltd.</u> v <u>Limmer and Trinided Co. Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1975%201%20WLR%201281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1975 1 W.L.R. 1281</a>, 1287 there is a difference between failing to prove an agreement and proving an agreement the construction of which is in doubt:we are bound to resolve any doubt of construction, for that is the function of a court of Law. Although we do not have to decideupon the interpretation of all the clauses of the "B" Conditions, our decision necessarily involves ascertaining whether all thoseConditions apply, for if the arbitration clause applies so must they all. The task is no light one, because the language used bythe parties is far from clear, and I come to a decision with considerable hesitation, but, looking at the whole of the documents,I think the learned Chief Justice was right and that the "B" Conditions do apply to the dispute. I add only that I reserve the questionwhether a case might arise where the extras so far outweighed the repairs specified in the tender that the latter might fairly beignored under the de minimis principle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The last requirement which the dock company had to fulfil was that they show they were ready and willing to do all things necessaryto the proper conduct of the arbitration both when the action was brought and at the time of their application for the stay. Withrespect to Mr. Ching I think his argument on this point confused readiness and willingness to arbitrate with making a firm decisionto seek arbitration. It is, of course, entirely correct that what has to be proved is a state of mind, the existence of which cannotdepend upon a defendant's being asked whether he is ready and willing, but in the absence of the question it may be difficult tofind extrinsic evidence of his state of mind. The dock company asserted that they were ready and willing and it was sought to contradictthat evidence by evidence that the company had not decided to insist on arbitration. The dock company was the defendant and was underno obligation to expedite the ship-owners' claim. Whether or not an application to the court for the particulars for which they hadasked by letter would have constituted a "step in the proceedings" is apparently open to argument (see <u>Fathers of Confederation Buildings Trust</u> v <u>Pigott Construction Co. Ltd.</u> [1974] 44 D.L.R. (3rd Ed.) 265) but, having been granted an extension of time to file that Defence, they were entitled to delay eventhough the particulars might not be necessary to enable them to file that Defence. The ship-owners were masters of the proceedingsand could have given notice at any time requiring a Defence (as they eventually did). That would have forced the dock company's hands:they would either have had to take a step in the proceedings or have applied for a stay. That they did neither of those things doesnot prove that they were not ready and willing to arbitrate. There was evidence upon which the learned Chief Justice could properlyfind that they were ready and willing.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> That leaves only the discretion to refuse a stay where there is sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitrationin accordance with the Agreement. Weighty dicta have been cited to us which establish that there is a "strong bias" in favour ofmaintaining the special bargain between the parties: see, e.g., <u>Metropolitan Tunnel and Public Works, Ltd.</u> v <u>London Electric Railway Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1926%20Ch%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1926 Ch. 371</a>, 390. It is enough to say that the learned Chief Justice considered all the relevant factors and that I am not persuaded he was wrongin his conclusion.

I am equally in no doubt thatthe Defendants were ready and willing within the meaning of that term in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap.341</a> to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration and that they were so ready and so willing at the timewhen these proceedings were commenced. There is distinction between a state of readiness and willingness and insistance upon arbitrationand it was only insistance that was not demonstrated for approximately 18 months, that is, until the issue of the summons for a stayof the present proceedings.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> As it seems to me however the Appellants must succeed upon this appeal and the order for a stay of the proceedings be set aside sincethe Defendants have been unable to demonstrate, as is their onus, that the dispute lies within the ambit of the Arbitration Clause.The Ship Repair Agreement, which has been referred to as the Master Agreement, states in Clause 6 that the Dockyard Standard Conditions"A" or "B" are to apply during the whole period of the Agreement unless specifically amended by the terms of the Agreement. It wasMr. Evans' contention for the Defendants that either Standard Conditions "A" or Standard Conditions "B" must apply to the repairs.With respect I am unable to agree for there is no reason in law or in logic why that should be so for although at one stage Mr. Chingconceded that for the purpose of this appeal either Standard Conditions "A" or Standard Conditions "B" applied, it became apparentthat that concession was confined to his argument to the effect that the tender had never been accepted; for subsequently, in arguingthe ambit of the Arbitration Clause, he urged that the "B" Conditions applied only to works specified in the tender and to claimsarising therefrom. In truth there is no reason why both sets of Conditions should not apply to the contract. Standard Conditions"A" are expressed in their very title as "governing repairs when no tender is submitted" whereas the "B" Standard Conditions areexpressed as "governing repairs pursuant to tenders". It is common ground that the work actually performed on the ship and chargedfor and paid for was not confined to the times detailed in the tender submitted by the Defendants. Clause 4 of the Standard Conditions"B" reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%"></td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="2%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">(4) Any work done, materials supplied, services rendered or charges incurred by the Contractor which are not expressly included inthe tender will be charged separately and at the Contractor's tariff rates where applicable."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Quite plainly some of the work performed was in the nature of extra work as contemplated by Clause 4 and was not the subject of tender.But the document containing the Arbitration Clause, that is Standard Conditions "B", is headed:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="3%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="87%" class="quote"><u>Standard Conditions - "B"</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="3%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="87%" class="quote">Governing repairs pursuant to tenders"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">which clearly delimits the maters to which the conditions, including the Arbitration Clause, shall apply. Moreover Clause 1 of these"B" Conditions states unequivocally that "the tender covers and includes the work herein specified and all specified removals inconnection therewith". Extra work is not embraced in that definition but is separately provided for by Clause 4 and had it been theintention that the Standard Conditions "B" should apply not only to works specified in Clause 1 but also to extra work not the subjectof tender, nothing could have been more simple than to have said so. It is this very dichotomy between Clauses 1 and 4 which in myview differentiates Standard Conditions "B" from the common type of building contract containing provisions for extras.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> There are in existence two sets of special Conditions "A" and "B" but those Conditions relate to "repairs" and not to vessels. Quiteclearly if the whole of the work on one vessel was covered by an accepted tender Conditions "B" would apply whereas if work on anothervessel was the subject of an order without any tender Conditions "A" would operate: but there is no reason why both sets of conditionsshould not apply to work on the same vessel since what the special Conditions govern are repairs and those repairs can be contractedfor, as in this case, at different times and by different methods - both within the contemplation of the parties - one involvingthe submission of a tender and the other no such submission. It is the fact that the two sets of special Conditions govern repairsand not vessels which seems to me to negative the "stream to seawall" argument which has appealed to my brother, Leonard, J.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> With respect, the comment that a situation in which both sets of Conditions apply at the same time was unlikely to have been intendedby the parties, is irrelevant. The question is - what does the document mean? This is not the same question as - what did the partiesintend when they executed it? They are presumed to have intended that which they in fact said and the Court must not, by supplyinginformation, substitute its own idea of what the parties meant. It is only where the words used are not clear and unambiguous thatintention will prevail. But nothing could be less ambiguous than "governing repairs pursuant to tenders" - the more so when thereis in existence another standard form of conditions "governing repairs where no tender is submitted". The phrase "the tender coversand includes the work herein specified and all specified removals in connection therewith", contained in Clause 1 of Conditions "B",is equally clear and the fact that the possibility of extra work, over and above that tendered for, being ordered is contemplatedin Clause 4, does not detract from that clarity.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I entirely agree that more assistance is to be derived from the body of a document than from its title but even if we turn from theunambiguous description "Governing repairs pursuant to tenders" contained in the heading of the "B" Conditions the very next thingencountered is the definition clause which does not include extras.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The fact that the "A" Conditions contained no clause similar to Clause 4 (the extras clause) in Conditions "B" is not surprising.By their very nature the "A" Conditions are not susceptible of such a clause because where work is ordered item by item there canbe no such thing as extras it being only where an estimate or tender has been given, intended to embrace the work to be done, thatextras can arise.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the view which I have taken it is necessary for the Defendants, if they wish to insist upon arbitration and to stay the Courtproceedings, to demonstrate that the fire which occurred upon the ship arose during the course of or otherwise in connection withthe execution of tender work as opposed to extra work. No attempt has been made to demonstrate this although, in view of the Defendants'stated possession of upwards of 50 written statements concerning the cause of the fire, the probable cause must be well within theirknowledge. It is argued that the burden of the Plaintiffs' allegations is that the fire was caused by an electrical fault - and electricalwork was covered by the original tender. The inference reached for is that if the Plaintiffs are right in alleging that the firestarted as a result of an electrical fault that fault must have occurred in the course of tender work. But this is simply not sofor certainly some electrical work was so covered but a comparison of the tender details with the items eventually billed, revealsthat "extra" electrical work was performed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Evans criticises the practical situation arising if Conditions "B" apply to part of the work performed upon the ship and Conditions"A" to another part describing it as inconvenient and absurd. That the result is clumsy and inconvenient I would agree but I do notthink it necessarily absurd. There is no reason why businessmen should not provide that disputes arising from certain types of workshould be referred to arbitration whilst those arising from other types of work should not and this is the precise result for whichthe parties contracted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> For these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the stay ordered by the judge in chambers and restore the order of the Registrarrefusing the stay. </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Charles Ching, Q.C. &amp; William Waung (Deacons) for appellant Evans, Q.C. &amp; A.

The position where no tender is submitted is covered as is the position where repairsare carried out pursuant to tenders but there appears at first sight to be no provision for the case where a tender is submittedbut the repairs being done are not being done pursuant to it. This lacuna I regard as more apparent than real because of Clauses1 and 4 of Special Conditions "B". The relevant sentence in Clause 1 reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="4%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">The tender covers and includes the work herein specified and all specified removals in connection therewith."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">I would emphasize the word "tender" and the word "herein".

Further the use of the word "tender" as distinctfrom the words "these conditions" raises at least the possibility that Special Conditions "B" would affect the rights of the partieswhen repairs other than the work actually specified in the tender to which they are to be attached were being carried out. The possibilityof such work existing is adverted to in Clause 4 which reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="8%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="4%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">Any work done, material supplied, services rendered or charges incurred by the Contractor which are not expressly included in thetender will be charged separately and at the Contractor's tariff rates where applicable."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">This clause then covers what may loosely be termed "extras" and the manner in which payment for them is to be computed.

"EL Jigue" on the 1st February 1971. They got what therespondents called "our tender No. T. 25/71". In the court below this document was regarded throughout as "the tender" so that Mr.Ching was constrained to admit that he could not argue that it was not a tender. He nevertheless and perhaps casuistically arguedthat it was not and could not be regarded as an offer capable of acceptance because of the many instances in it where figures werenot firm. Be that as it may I am persuaded in the complete absence of any evidence to the contrary that it was under this documentand the Ship Repair Agreement that the appellants entrusted their ship to the respondents. I must therefore look to it to ascertainthe rights and liabilities of the parties while the vessel was so entrusted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is headed in large print "Tender" bears the Tender No. T. 25/71 and annotations "Date issued 20th February 1971" and "Date expires20th May 1971".

I do not think any useful purpose will be servedby my listing the other items set out in this document. It concludes with the words "Conditions see over". The Conditions set outoverleaf were, it is common case, Standard Conditions "B". Again it is common case that while the vessel was with the respondentsa very large amount of work not listed in the "tender" nor contemplated by the "tender" was done and there is no evidence as to whetherthe fire giving rise to the litigation occurred while the extra work was being done. It was Mr. Ching's case that unless the casualtywas proved to have arisen while the work specified in the "Tender" was being done the respondents had failed to prove that the arbitrationclause was applicable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This argument does not commend itself to me. I agree with Mr. Evans that it is necessary to distinguish between three questions whendetermining the applicability of the arbitration clause - (a) the scope of the tender; (b) the scope of the contract between theparties the scope that is of the rights and liabilities of the parties arising from the documents I have particularised and the actionof the appellants in entrusting the vessel to the respondents and (c) the scope of the submission to arbitration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> As to (a) I would agree with Mr. Ching that the respondents have failed to prove that the fire arose from the "tender work". I wouldnot however agree that for that reason it has not been proved to have arisen within the scope of the agreement delineating the partiesrights and liabilities. My reasons are almost self-evident from my earlier recital of the documents. Clause 6 of the Ship RepairAgreement read in its context and with Clause 1 of the same agreement in mind indicates that either Standard Conditions "A" shallapply in connection with the work to be done to any vessel "placed" for repair or Standard Conditions "B" shall apply. Clause 6 mustbe read with the Standard Conditions in mind also. Standard Conditions "A" apply only where no tender has been "submitted" (the wordis not "accepted"). If a tender is submitted its terms are to prevail. I can find in this no support for the suggestion that StandardConditions "A" may apply to "extras" in a case where a tender has been submitted. I have already indicated my view that the apparentlacuna between the two sets of Special Conditions disappears when one bears in mind all the documents and that Clause 4 of SpecialConditions "B" visualizes "extras" while no clause in Special Conditions "A" does so. From the practical business point of view itseems to me that the respondents would refrain from submitting a "Tender" and so bring Special Conditions "A" into force where oneor two readily ascertainable and simple jobs of work were to be done but would submit a "tender", thereby rendering Special Conditions"A" inapplicable, in a more complicated case where "extras" might be involved. The title of Special Conditions "B" i.e. "Governingrepairs pursuant to tenders" is not entirely incorrect in such cases as at least some repairs to be done would be "repairs pursuantto tender". The wording is loose for strictly speaking many of the conditions do not govern repairs. For the intention of the partiesone must look to the entirety of the document rather than its title. Turning to the actual "tender" in this case we have the expressincorporation of Special Conditions "B" in it together with the initial paragraph or item. These factors combine to indicate to mean intention that Special Conditions "B" shall apply between the time the vessel is towed "from stream to seawall until it is towed"out to stream again upon completion of repairs". The intention is perhaps not clearly expressed but its implication appears to meinevitable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I turn then to the third question - the scope of the arbitration clause itself. In its wording this could not be wider. Once grantedthat Special Conditions "B" are applicable it is to me inevitable that it be binding in the events that have happened whether theclaim be in contract or in tort.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1977/212.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
