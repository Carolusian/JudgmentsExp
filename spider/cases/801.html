I am only required to decide the issue of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The trial has been short.  I have not heard any live evidence.  On the afternoon of the first day I had a view of the <i>locus</i> of the accident which included driving past the location of the accident along the outer lane of the expressway which is where thefatal collision took place.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Having heard the matter over two days on Wednesday and Thursday 4 and 5 October and having adjourned for judgment to be handed downthe following week I received, on Monday 9 October, an application by the Plaintiff to admit the evidence of Mr Chau Sau Wang, nowthe Station Commander of Ma On Shan Fire Station, who on the date of the accident, as a Senior Station Officer, attended the siteof the collisions and was in charge of the fire services rescue operation.  He has attached to his witness statement his report ofwhat he and his colleagues did on that occasion, which is dated 27 July 1996 two days after the date of this matter.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  This therefore was an application by the plaintiff to reopen her case after the close of the evidence and speeches but before judgment. The issue to which this new evidence was to be directed was the speed of the deceasedâs car just prior to and at the moment ofimpact with a stationary LGV which resulted in the fatality.  I will be describing the course of these events in some detail presently. Having heard the application I declined to admit this evidence for reasons which I will now give before I embark on my judgmentin this action.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  As will emerge from my narrative of the events giving rise to the fatal collision between the deceasedâs motor car and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs LGV, the Defendantsâ case has been that judging from the very severe damage to his motor car and the absence of anybrake marks prior to the collision, the deceased was not paying attention to the road ahead and that he was speeding excessively. This combination of excessive speed and the absence of keeping a lookout is said to amount to recklessness which, as the cases towhich I have been referred show, would render any prior negligence by the Defendants inoperative, with the result that they shouldnot be held liable for the deceasedâs collision with the LGV.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The purport of the evidence sought to be admitted was that the accident damage to the deceasedâs car may not have been as seriousas has been portrayed in the course of trial with the result that any finding as to excessive speed would need to be tempered bythe effect of this new evidence.  The post-accident photographs, which I will be referring to presently, show that the bonnet ofthe motor car had been removed as had the roof of the car which supports the Defendantâs case of excessive, in terms of the 70kph speed-limit, and great speed.  Mr Chauâs evidence is that the roof and the bonnet âmay haveâ been removed in the courseof the rescue operation when the fire services had to extract the deceased from the car and put out the fire in the engine compartment.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In pressing for the admission of this evidence Mr Sarony, SC has accepted, as he must, that this evidence could and, by necessaryimplication as he now seeks to put it in, should have been called at the proper time and that it was only after the conclusion ofthe trial, as the various aspects of the accident had been debated, that the significance of the photographs showing the post accidentstate of the deceasedâs car became clearer, particularly having regard to the fact that these would have been taken after the fireservices had removed the deceased from the vehicle.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Given the fact that this evidence is relevant going to a material issue in the determination of the action, Mr Sarony invites meto exercise my discretion in favour of its admission.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The relevant principles are as Mr Ozorio, SC has related them in his submissions in opposition to the admission of the evidence. It seems to me that the plaintiff needs to show exceptional circumstances to justify the calling of this evidence at such a latestage.  There is no doubt that I have a discretion to allow evidence to be called, even after judgment, but before any consequentorder has been drawn up.  This is clearly demonstrated by the cases of <i>Charlesworth v Relay Roads Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20WLR%20230" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 WLR 230</a> and <i>Navitaire Inc v Easy Jet</i> <i>Airline Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2005/0282.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) EWHC 0282 (Ch)</a>, these principles having been applied in Hong Kong in cases such as <i>Born Chief Co. v George Tsai</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20HKC%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 HKC 282</a> and <i>Chow Siu Po v Wong Ming Fung</i> unreported, HCAP 3/1998.  What can be said is that the court can be more flexible in its approach where, as here, the applicationis made before judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In dismissing the application I had decided, leaving aside questions of lateness and to the fact that the evidence should have beencalled at the appropriate time, that even if the damage shown in the photographs is after the arrival of the fire services who mayhave had to remove the damaged bonnet and had to remove the roof by welding equipment this would not have changed the overall impressionas to the deceasedâs pre-accident speed.  On any view the damage to this car, even after the fire services had made it appear worsein their rescue operations, amply supports a finding of excessive and great speed.  I have also had regard to the fact that the proposedwitness, 10 years on, could never give firm evidence as to what was actually done by him and his colleagues, hence his use of termsas âmay haveâ.  He cannot get much assistance from his contemporaneous report because it is silent as to the matters which hehas been asked to speak to in his witness statement.  I am bound to say that had the fire services needed to hack off the roof ofthe vehicle with welding equipment or other means that this, I would have thought, would appear in the incident report as opposedto the basic statement that one finds in the report.  And so, I consider this evidence would not have been especially compellingdue to its understandable vagueness, given the passage of 10 years since the accident.  It would not have altered the overall evidentialpicture and as I have already observed it could and should have been called during the course of the trial.  For all of these reasonsI decided not to let it in at this late stage.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I now propose to set out the facts as I find them.  Where it becomes necessary to provide reasons for any particular finding I willset out my reasons there and then.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The evidence comprises a number of photographs which are exhibited in the case as well as a plan prepared by the Highways Departmentwhich provides all the necessary detail such as the location of various lamposts along the expressway.  There are also plans preparedby the police following their investigations at the site of the accident.  Because no witness has given evidence I have ignored theirwitness statements.  What I have had regard to are the recorded interviews of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants taken by the investigating police officers.  The interviews contain the accounts given by these two Defendants as to theirinvolvement in the events of that night.  I will indicate my approach to the contents of the interviews as and when I set out theparts which provide the narrative of what occurred.</p>    <p class="heading">The Parties</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff is the widow of Mr Daniel Fu who I will refer to as the deceased.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the driver of a light goods vehicle registration number FT2902 (âthe LGVâ).  He was an employee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who also owned the LGV.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is the registered owner and at the time the driver of a tow truck registration number FR6978 (âthe tow truckâ).</p>    <p class="heading">The Material Facts</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  This matter is concerned with two separate collisions.  The first occurred when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant fell asleep at the controls of the LGV and crashed into a lampost and the crash barrier which runs along the outer boundaryof the offside carriageway of the expressway.  As a result of the collision, the LGV finished up lying horizontally across the outsidelane, blocking it completely, with its rear also encroaching into the middle lane.  This occurred at about 2 a.m.  I find that thecause of this accident was due to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant having fallen asleep at the wheel.  I say that because this is what he told the police who interviewed him.  He also toldthe police that prior to driving he had consumed three cans of beer.  I have no doubt that the combination of tiredness and the consumptionof beer caused him to doze off as he drove.  This collision between the LGV and the crash barrier and the lampost was witnessed bythe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant who had been driving a safe distance behind.  On seeing what was happening he was able to drive his tow truck around theLGV and park it a few paces beyond the now stationary and disabled LGV.  The tow truck pulled well into the side of the outside carriagewayso that its offside wheels were over and onto the hard shoulder of the carriageway.  This is all well illustrated in two police plansat pages C7 and 8 and in a sketch drawn at the scene by a police officer which is at page C9.  Pages 8 and 9 also have the finalresting place of the deceasedâs motor car which can be ignored until I recount his part in the tragic events of that night.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Having parked his tow truck, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant put on his vehicleâs hazard warning lights including a flashing light on top of the driverâs compartment.  I find thisas a fact having regard to what he told the police.  It seems to me that this must be true given that this is what tow truck driverswould do at a breakdown or an accident to indicate their presence and to warn other vehicles of their presence on or at the sideof the road.  He then went to speak to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to see if he could assist him including giving him a tow.  The police interviews indicate the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said that he would like to be towed to Tuen Mun. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant then investigated the situation of the LGV and discovered that its front axle had hooked over the crash barrier so thatit could not be released by his vehicle and towed away.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The agreed police photographs are of much assistance in giving a reliable impression of the position of the LGV as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant found it. These are at bundle C.  In looking at the photographs of the LGV it should be remembered that they were takenafter the deceasedâs car had collided with its rear so that the rear may have been pushed forward by the impact.  Nevertheless,the important matters to observe are that its headlights were on, shinning into the side of the carriageway as shown in photographs13 and 14 [C28 and 29].  Prior to its being collided into by the deceasedâs vehicle, I am satisfied that its rear lights wouldhave been on but, given its final position, at best horizontal across the carriageway, these lights would not have been visible tooncoming traffic, although perhaps their beam may have made some impression, not a great deal, on the road surface immediately belowthem.  As to visibility another feature is that as a result of its collision, the LGV knocked over a lampost with the result thatits nearest source of illumination had been extinguished.  Mr Sarony SC, for the Plaintiff, invites me to conclude that in termsof its visibility to oncoming traffic the LGV would have presented, at best, a misleading picture.  There would have been light atthe front, lighting up the bushes at the side of the road, then darkness from the driverâs compartment down the body of the LGVuntil one got to the rear lights which would have not been directly visible to oncoming traffic, but as I have already observed somesmall source of light may have been showing around the tail of the LGV.  At all events a very unclear situation.  Against this MrOzorio SC, who appears for all the Defendants, points to the fact that the other lamposts along the expressway would have been providinga general illumination â this was not a case of oncoming traffic travelling in darkness lit up by their own headlights â andhe also draws attention to the fact that beyond the LGV, a few yards up the road, was the tow truck lights on including hazard warninglights and the light above the truck on and flashing.  The tow truck is shown at photograph 12 [C28] and these lights are visibleand would have been visible and made an impression on oncoming traffic above the height of the cargo platform of the LGV.  This iswell illustrated at photo 13 [C28].  This then is the factual situation as I find it to be in the aftermath of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant falling asleep at the wheel and crashing into the side of the expressway.</p>    <p class="heading">The Fatal Collision</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  From this I now turn to the fatal collision between the deceasedâs saloon car and the LGV.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant says that he did not see this collision as it happened.  All he can say as to timing is that it happened about three minutesafter the first collision by the LGV.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, who saw it happen, says that it was at about 2:10 a.m., so about 10 minutes after his collision.  He says that after hehad come to a halt following his collision with the crash barrier about 10 vehicles had gone past his LGV without mishap.  It isnot possible for me to be precise as to how long after the LGV had crashed into the side of the expressway the deceasedâs motorcar collided with the LGV.  All that I can say is that it was anything between 3 and 10 minutes which are the two times given bythe 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants respectively.  As to my approach to what these Defendants told the police in their interviews, I must take into accountthe fact that what they said was not under oath nor have these accounts been tested in cross-examination because they have electednot to give evidence.  Nevertheless, the message that I get from a reading of these interviews is that they had tried to be as frankand helpful as they could with the police.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had been approached on the basis that he was a witness and not as a person who was potentially culpable.  I am preparedto accept everything that he told the police as being as accurate as he could recollect it.  Similarly for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Although he was clearly in the frame for prosecution as being a driver at fault, he appears to have given a truthfulaccount having made a number of declarations against interest.  He said that he had fallen asleep at the wheel, that he had consumedthree cans of beer an hour beforehand and that he had exceeded the speed limit.  And so in his case as well I am prepared to accepteverything that he had said as being an account that is as accurate as he could provide it.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  An absolutely crucial feature of this case, which will be determinative of its outcome is the nature of the deceasedâs drivingin the moments prior to the collision with the rear end of the LGV.  I take the lay out of the expressway first.  In this respectthe view I had has been helpful although perhaps less helpful that one taken in the hours of darkness which would have been a betterreproduction of the circumstances but nevertheless, the view has been of much assistance.  The expressway climbs out of Tsuen Wanquite steeply at first and then the slope becomes more gradual before levelling out and in fact, goes into a slight decline at thepoint of the collision.  The carriageway is straight, as the Highways Department plan shows it to be as do the defence photographsExhibit D1-19.  This layout of the expressway, I am afraid, lends itself to speed.  The speed limit at that point is only 70 km anhour which, I suspect, is easily and frequently exceeded.  During the day the traffic can be heavy.  In the early hours it would,I suspect, be quiet but undoubtedly traffic would be steady, meaning that vehicles would be going through all the time.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did say that about 10 vehicles had passed after he had collided with the crash barrier before the deceased had collidedwith his LGV.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The photographs of the deceasedâs motor car, with its upper structure sheered off by the speed and force of the impact indicatewithout any doubt at all that he must have been travelling very fast at the moment of impact.  It is impossible to be precise aboutthis sort of thing but I am prepared to say that he was, on a balance of probability, travelling at well over 100 km an hour justbefore the moment of impact.  The other important feature is that there are no brake marks which preceded the impact.  This wouldindicate that the deceased had not observed the obstruction caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs LGV across the offside lane.  Doing my best to re-construct what happened I am of the view that the deceased, at best,only saw the obstruction an instant before impact and attempted to steer to his left to avoid it.  This is supported by the factthat only the nearside upper structure of the saloon car remained intact, indicating that this part of the motor car had not struckthe LGV.  The pale marks at the rear end of the LGV denote the area where the deceasedâs car came into contact with the LGV [Seephoto 18 C31].  What appears to have happened is that the car, being a low vehicle relative to the LGV, effectively went underneaththe rear end of the LGV removing the LGVâs rear lighting units.  It then appears to have careered onwards and according to the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant came into contact with the offside of the tow truck, although any contact with it was slight.  As to this, the evidenceis inconclusive and in the event does not matter very much, and then came to rest in the position shown in the sketch at C8 and 9,where it caught fire.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  From these facts, I am satisfied that the deceased had been speeding excessively and that he was not paying attention to the roadahead.  Whether that was because he had dozed off at the time or because he was just not looking ahead at the time or because hegot mixed signals from the lights that were showing from the LGV and from the tow truck is impossible to say.  What seems clear isthat the lighting from the other lamposts, the nearest one to the LGV having been put out of commission by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs negligent driving, would have afforded some additional illumination from which a reasonably careful driver, observingthe speed limit and keeping a proper lookout would have seen the general nature of the obstruction ahead and driven safely into themiddle or nearside lane to avoid a collision, as at least 10 vehicles had done before this tragic accident.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  For whichever of the three reasons which I have set out in the preceding paragraph, the deceased must be held to have been veryseriously at fault.  The nature and extent of his culpability I will leave over until after I have considered the relevant legalprinciples to which both counsel have very helpfully referred me.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In order to complete the factual situation, I should observe that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was, inevitably, prosecuted for the offence of careless driving to which he pleaded guilty and was fined and disqualifiedfor three months.  He admitted having fallen asleep at the wheel.  No action was taken against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.  The deceasedâs and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs vehicles were examined by the Government Vehicle Examiner who found that both vehicles had properly functioning steeringand brakes.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issues</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Ozorio accepts that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant must be found to have been negligent.  Nevertheless, he submits that his negligence was not causative of the deceasedâscollision with the LGV, with the consequence that his client cannot be held liable for what happened to the deceased.  He has shownme some authorities which he says support such a conclusion on these facts.  If he fails in this submission, he then contends thatthe deceased must be guilty of contributory negligence of the highest order â certainly over 80%.  Mr Sarony submits that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs admittedly negligent driving was undoubtedly an operative cause of the collision for which the deceased must be contributorilynegligent by up to 50%.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  As to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Mr Sarony submits that he is also liable to be found culpable.  Having decided to stop and offer a tow, this after allbeing his occupation, he should have taken steps to warn oncoming traffic.  He should have heeded the advice of the Highway Code. This is at page 124 of the Code.  When happening upon an accident the Code says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Do not leave your vehicle where it could become a hazard to other traffic, but park at the roadside between the accident site andoncoming traffic and where your vehicle can easily be seen â¦ use your hazard warning light.  At night you can light the accidentsite with your headlamps.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Alternatively, he submits that he should have taken some other steps to warn oncoming vehicles such as by deploying a luminescentwarning triangle.</p>    <p class="heading">No Case against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I wish to dispose of this part of the case now.  There simply is no case against this Defendant.  I find that in the circumstancesthat he found himself he took the very sensible course of driving around the LGV and parking âleewardâ of it, as it were, havingpulled over into the hard shoulder.  He already had his headlights and rear lights on and thereafter, on my finding, he turned onhis hazard light and the flashing beacon on top of the tow truck.  Mr Sarony submits that certain additional duties are to be caston him because of his financial motive in soliciting the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs custom as a potential tow.  Mr Sarony does not suggest that he could have made any criticism of an ordinary motoristwho had pulled over as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had to see if he could help.  Mr Sarony submits that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant should have somehow secured the scene by giving adequate warning to the oncoming traffic.  He has relied on the passagein the Highway Code  which would suggest that he should have parked âwindwardâ of the LGV.  I am not entirely sure how this couldapply to a tow truck who would have to tow in the direction of the flow of the traffic.  Inevitably, the tow truck would have hadto park where the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had parked to take on the tow.  At all events, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had reacted perfectly reasonably by going round as he did and then putting on all his available illumination which wouldhave been visible to oncoming traffic over the top of the LGVâs cargo platform.  As to placing a luminous warning triangle somedistance to the rear of the LGV to warn oncoming traffic, Mr Sarony, I do not believe presses this with any great enthusiasm.  Itwould have been a dangerous thing to attempt, probably ineffective and certainly contrary to the advice in the Highway Code [Seepage 123].  In my judgment, the Plaintiffâs advisers have gone a Defendant too far in seeking to fix the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant with any sort of liability.  The action against him must fail with the consequence that there must be judgment to him againstthe Plaintiff together with an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff must pay the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs costs to be taxed on a party and party basis.</p>    <p class="heading">The Case against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is accepted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant must be vicariously liable for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as employer and owner of the LGV.  Their cases stand and fall together.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The starting point is that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was guilty of a bad case of negligent driving â this on any view of the matter.  Mr Ozorio accepts that this Defendantwas negligent.  The crucial question then becomes this: was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs negligence (and I will need to say something about nuisance presently) causative of the collision between the deceasedâsmotor car and the LGV?  Mr Ozorio submits that whilst it may have provided the background to the accident it was the reckless drivingof the deceased, going beyond negligence even of the worst kind, that caused this accident.  The obstruction caused by LGV was thereto be seen but it was the nature of the deceasedâs driving, which I have already sufficiently described, which was the sole operativecause of his accident.</p>    <p class="heading">The Cases</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr Ozorio has relied on two English Court of Appeal decisions which are the mainstay of his submission.  The first is <i>Rouse v Squires</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20QB%20889" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 QB 889</a> and the other <i>Wright v Lodge</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%204%20All%20ER%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 4 All ER 299.</a>  I need to recount the facts of both these cases in order to identify the principle which they establish.  In both cases the headnoteof the reports sufficiently sets out the facts.  In <i>Rouse v Squires</i>, the situation was this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<i>On a frosty December night an articulated lorry skidded into a jack-knife position, obstructing the nearside and centre lanes of thenorth-bound three-lane carriageway of the M1 motorway. A motor car being driven in the centre lane collided with the lorry and stoppedwith its rear lights on.  Another lorry driver who had been following parked with the handbrake on in the nearside lane some 15 feetshort of the jack-knifed lorry with headlights on to illuminate it.  Five to ten minutes later, the defendant, driving a lorry inthe same direction at 50 miles per hour, with dipped headlights, came within view of the collision scene some 400 yards away.  Hedid not realise the vehicles were stationary until within 150 yards.  Seeing the parked lorry, he braked, moved into the centre laneand then realised that lane was blocked.  Braking harder, he skidded and collided with the parked lorry which was pushed forwardand knocked down and killed R who was assisting at the scene of the collision.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><i>Râs widow brought an action against the defendant, which was compromised.  The defendant took third party proceedings against theowners and driver of the jack-knifed lorry, alleging negligent driving of that lorry and nuisance and claiming a contribution.  Thethird parties contended that their driverâs negligence was not causative of Râs death.  The judge found that the defendant haddriven extremely negligently, that he was not keeping a proper lookout, that he should have observed that the vehicles were stationarylong before he did and that his speed was excessive in the frosty conditions.  He found that the scene of the obstruction was adequatelylighted to warn any driver keeping a proper lookout and that the situation arising from the third party driverâs negligence wasnot causative of the accident which was attributable to the defendantâs negligence.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><i>On appeal by the defendant:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p><i>Held, allowing the appeal, that if a driver negligently obstructed a highway and created a danger to other road users (including thosedriving too fast and not keeping a proper lookout but not those who deliberately or recklessly drove into the obstruction) then hisnegligence contributed to the causation of an accident of which the immediate cause was the negligent driving of another driver butwhich would not have occurred but for the continuing danger from the obstruction he had caused (post, pp. 898C-E, 899H</i> <i>â</i> 900A, 901C-D, H <i>â</i> 902A); accordingly, while the immediate cause of the accident was the defendantâs negligent driving, there had been no break inthe chain of causation between the third party driverâs negligence and the accident, and the third party driver was one-quarterto blame.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Cairns LJ at page 898C-E analysed the situation in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>If a driver so negligently manages his vehicle as to cause it to obstruct the highway and constitute a danger to other road users,including those who are driving too fast or not keeping a proper lookout, but not those who deliberately or recklessly drive intothe obstruction, then the first driverâs negligence may be held to have contributed to the causation of an accident of which theimmediate cause was the negligent driving of the vehicle which because of the presence of the obstruction collides with it or withsome other vehicle or some other person.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mackenna J at 899H explained it in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Where the party guilty of the prior negligence has created a dangerous situation, and the danger is still continuing to a substantialdegree at the time of the accident, and the accident would not have happened but for this continuing danger, he is responsible forthe accident as well as the party who was subsequently negligent.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Whilst this may be so, Buckley LJ held that if the obstruction no longer constituted a danger then the chain of causation would bebroken.  At 901C he said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>But when there is ample visibility and ample opportunity for the driver of an oncoming vehicle to see and appreciate the nature andextent of an obstruction and to take evasive action, then the obstruction does not constitute a danger, and in such a case thereis a break in the chain of causation between the prior negligent act which caused the obstruction and the immediate consequencesof the latter negligent act of a driver on the highway who causes the accident.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is this, which Mr Ozorio says, happened in this case.  The obstruction caused by the LGV was there to be seen.  Nevertheless, onthis occasion the deceased had failed to see the obvious obstruction which was greatly exacerbated by the high speed that he wastravelling at.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In <i>Wright v Lodge</i>,the facts were these:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>The respondentâs car broke down on the eastbound carriageway of an unlit dual carriageway at night when visibility was very poorowing to fog.  The car came to a stop in the nearside lane of the carriageway and while the respondent was attempting to start itan articulated container lorry driven by the appellant crashed into the back of it, causing a passenger in the rear seat of the carto be seriously injured.  The lorry then veered out of control across the central reservation and came to rest on its side in theopposite westbound carriageway, where it was struck by three cars and a lorry.  The driver of one of the cars was killed and anotherdriver was injured.  At the time of the collision with the respondentâs car the appellantâs lorry was travelling at an excessivespeed.  The injured driver and the personal representative of the dead driver sued the appellant and the respondent, while the injuredpassenger in the respondentâs car sued the appellant, who joined the respondent as a third party.  The appellant admitted liabilityin all three actions but claimed contribution from the respondent.  The judge found that the appellant had been driving recklesslyand that that was the sole cause of the injuries to the dead and injured drivers since it was the appellantâs reckless drivingwhich had caused the lorry to end up on the westbound carriageway.  The judge accordingly dismissed the contribution claims relatingto the dead and injured drivers.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b><i>Held</i></b><i> </i><i>â</i> The driver of a motor vehicle could owe different duties of care to different road users since different questions of foreseeability,causation and remoteness could arise in respect of different road users affected by his negligence.  Thus, if his vehicle was involvedin a collision with another vehicle partly as a result of his own negligence, he was not necessarily responsible for subsequent eventswhich occurred as the result of another driverâs reckless driving which caused damage which would not have occurred if that driverhad merely been driving negligently, since reckless driving was in a different category from negligent driving and an obstructionon the highway which was a danger only to a reckless driver was not necessarily a relevant danger in considering the liability ofthe person who negligently caused the obstruction to be present.  On the facts, although the respondent had been negligent in notremoving her car from the carriageway onto the verge, the sole cause of the lorry ending up on the westbound carriageway and thedriversâ consequent death and injuries was the appellantâs reckless driving, which was the only relevant legal cause of thatevent. The judge had accordingly been correct to find that the respondent was not liable to make a contribution in respect of theappellantâs liability in regard to the dead and injured driversâ claims.  The appeal would therefore be dismissed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I need to refer to two passages from the judgment of Parker LJ. At 306C he said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>â¦ the case (Rouse v. Squires) was in reality concerned with the question whether or not an obstruction constituted a danger.  Itdoes not therefore</i> <i>directly assist the solution to the present problem.  Indirectly however it does in my judgment afford assistance in that it recognisesthat reckless driving is in a different category from negligent driving and that an obstruction which is only a danger to a recklessdriver does not constitute a relevant danger.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At page 307E-J, he has set out the proper approach in this class of case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>In any event approaching the matter as if he were a jury and taking a common sense view, he was, as we are, clearly entitled to concludethat the presence of the Scania in the westbound carriageway was wholly attributable to Mr Lodgeâs reckless driving.  It was unwarrantedand unreasonable.  It was the violence of the swerve and breaking which sent his lorry out of control. Such violence was due to thereckless manner in which he was driving and it was his reckless speed which resulted in the swerve, loss of control and headlongcareer onto, and overturn on, the westbound carriageway.  It is true that it would not have been there had the Mini not obstructedthe nearside lane of the eastbound carriageway but the passages which I have cited show clearly that this is not enough.  It doesnot thereby necessarily become a legally operative cause.  The subsequent conduct of Mr Lodge was such that any judge or jury couldin my judgment exclude Miss Shepherdâs conduct as being causative of the subsequent accident.  The judge did exclude it and inmy judgment he was right to do so.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  What I get from these cases therefore is that reckless driving will break the chain of causation between a previous piece of negligentdriving and a subsequent accident.  This therefore is the setting against which Mr Ozorio would wish me to decide the outcome ofthis case as between the Plaintiff and these two Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Case</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Sarony has pleaded this matter in both negligence and nuisance.  I wish to begin the consideration of his case by deciding whetherthe elements of the tort of public nuisance are present.  Put simply, Mr Ozorio has submitted that this matter can only be consideredas a case of negligence.  This was the aftermath of the first accident caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs negligent driving and all I need to decide is whether that negligence remained legally operative by the time of thesecond accident, given the nature of the deceasedâs driving.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  As to whether this obstruction amounted to a public nuisance, Mr Sarony has cited <i>Howard v Walker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%20KB%20860" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] KB 860</a> which proposes that obstruction of the highway will constitute obstruction of a road users right of free passage.  Factually, thiscase is so far removed from the one that I have to decide that I really get no assistance from it.  I believe that the case of <i>Dymond v Pearce</i> is of more assistance.  It is reported at <i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20QB%20496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 QB</i><i> 496</a></i>.  This was a case tried at Exeter Assizes by Bridge J (as he then was).  The facts were that a lorry driver had parked his lorryon the highway on an August bank holiday evening intending to leave early the next morning.  The lorry which was 7Â½ feet wide wasparked under a street lamp.  The driver had left the lorry lights on and the judge found that its was visible some 200 yards, whenat 9:45 p.m. a motorcyclist with the Plaintiff as his pillion passenger crashed into it.  The judge found that the sole cause ofthe accident was the motorcyclistâs negligence, who was not looking where he was going.  He held that the lorry driver and itsowner were not negligent and that the parked lorry did not constitute a nuisance and that even if it did it was not the cause ofthe accident and that the damage was not a foreseeable consequence.  The Court of Appeal upheld the judgeâs finding that the lorrydriver and the lorry owners had not been negligent but nevertheless, the court held that leaving a lorry for a considerable periodfor the driverâs convenience constituted a nuisance by obstruction which would be actionable if that obstruction caused damageto a member of the public.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Sarony is anxious to establish a case based on nuisance having regard to how the burden of proof plays in nuisance as opposedto an action merely based on negligence.  Reliance is placed on part of Denning LJâs judgment in <i>Southport Corporation v Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%202%20QB%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 2 QB 182:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>One of the principal differences between an action for a public nuisance and an action for negligence is the burden of proof.  Inan action for a public nuisance, once the nuisance is proved and the defendant is shown to have caused it, then, the legal burdenis shifted on to the defendant to justify or excuse himself.  If he fails to do so, he is held liable, whereas, in an action fornegligence the legal burden in most cases remains throughout on the plaintiff.  In negligence, the plaintiff may gain much help fromprovisional presumptions like the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur but nevertheless, at the end of the case, the judge must ask himselfwhether the legal burden is discharged.  If the matter is left evenly in the balance, the plaintiff fails.  But in public nuisance,as in trespass, the legal burden shifts to the defendant and it is not sufficient for him to leave the matter in doubt.  He mustplead and prove a sufficient justification or excuse.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>Dymond v Pearce</i> ibid.  Sachs LJ at page 501C-E set out what constituted a public nuisance.  He held that the relevant law was that stated by LordEvershed MR in <i>Trevetts v Lee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20WLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 WLR 113</a>, 117:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>The law as regards obstructions to highways is conveniently stated in a passage in Salmond on Torts, 11<sup>th</sup> Edition, p. 303.  âA nuisance to a highway consists either in obstructing it or in rendering it dangerousâ and then a numberof examples are given, which seem to me to show that, prima facie, or at any rate, when you speak of an obstruction to a highway,you mean something which permanently or temporarily removes the whole or part of the highway from the publicâs use altogether.</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At page 502C-D, Sachs L.J. said this in relation to the facts of <i>Dymond v Pearce</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Leaving on one side those in special positions â¦ the common law right of users of highways are normally confined to use for passageand re-passage and for incidents usually associated with such use, such as temporary halts and those emergency stops which oftengive rise to difficulties, and have had to be considered in a number of authorities.  The leaving of a large vehicle on a highwayfor any other purpose for a considerable period (it is always a matter of degree) otherwise then in a lay-by prima facie resultsin a nuisance being created, for it narrows the highway.</i>â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was on this basis that the Court of Appeal reversed Bridge Jâs conclusion that no nuisance had been created but felt able touphold him because the collision had been caused entirely through the motorcyclistâs fault who was not looking where he was going.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Sarony contends that this therefore was a nuisance.  Mr Ozorio submits that the shortlived and temporary nature of the obstructionwould take it out of what the court would conclude was a nuisance.  â<i>It is always a matter of degree</i>â <i>[See Sachs LJ supra]</i>.  For my part I would hold that in these circumstances this obstruction would not amount to a nuisance.  This was the temporary aftermathof an accident.  But even if I am wrong in that conclusion, and this did amount to a public nuisance Mr Sarony would still need toshow that this obstruction caused the accident [Sachs LJ at 502C ibid].  This being so he, and I, in having to decide the matter,are driven back to see what was the real and effective cause of the accident.  Mr Ozorio says that it was the deceasedâs recklessdriving.</p>    <p class="heading">What was the Cause of the Accident?</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  This must determine the issue of liability.  I have not found this an entirely easy case largely because this was not a collisionin daylight.  Had it been I do not believe that the deceased would have had any sort of case.  But this was at night and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had contrived to knock over the lampost closest to the LGVâs last resting place.  Nevertheless, lights were showing andI have no doubt the lights from both the LGV and the tow truck just beyond it were there to be seen in the offside carriageway. Any driver keeping a proper lookout would have seen them.  Any driver observing the speed limit or even exceeding it by a reasonablemargin would have had time to take evasive action.  I have no doubt at all that the deceased was not paying any proper attention. He drove straight on until just before the moment of impact.  To have driven in this manner, that is to say without paying attentionand at great speed, the accident damage amply confirms this, must amount to recklessness.  It goes well beyond negligence.  The factthat the deceased had not attempted to brake before impact demonstrates beyond any doubt that he had not seen what was there to beseen.  There were lights from all the sources that I have already referred to.  The prudent driver would have at least slowed downto get a better look, and reacted accordingly.  This is a straight piece of road.  Visibility to the obstruction was over 200 metresat that point.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Ultimately, I am satisfied beyond any doubt, that the sole cause of this tragedy was the deceasedâs reckless driving at the time. This being so the cases of <i>Rouse v Squires</i> and <i>Wright v Lodge</i>, <i>supra</i> lead me to the conclusion that the correct order is to dismiss the action against both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.  It also seems to me that even if the LGV was causing a public nuisance this cannot avail the Plaintiff because I havefound that the sole cause of the accident was the deceasedâs reckless driving.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In such circumstances these two Defendants must also have their party and party costs paid by the Plaintiff.
