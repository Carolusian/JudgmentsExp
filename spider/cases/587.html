The circumstances are that the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendantare wife and husband whose marriage is at present under litigation in the Divorce Court. The 2nd Defendant is the mother of the 1stDefendant. When the parties were married the mother bought property in the name of the 1st Defendant. The plaintiff wife allegesthat the property was a gift to both husband and wife and that there is, therefore, a trust created by the 2nd Defendant in her favourof half the value of the property. When the marriage broke up, the husband gave back the property to the mother and she sold it.The injunction sought related to the proceeds of sale. When the matter came before the Judge in Chambers he understood the positionto be that the claim was for damages for conspiracy and he granted an injunction believing that he was granting a "Mareva" injunction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The first question is whether or not there was any valid cause of action and the second whether there were grounds for a "Mareva"injunction. As I see it, there was no real basis for a claim although it is not necessary, in my view, to decide finally whetherthere was. I cannot myself, at the present time, see that there was any basis whatever for a trust, and I cannot, therefore, seethat there was any conspiracy to breach the trust, but what I am quite clear about is that there was no basis for a "Mareva" injunction.It is, I think, only some words of Lord Denning, M.R. in <u>Rahman</u> v <u>Abu Taha</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1980%201%20WLR%201268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1980 1 W.L.R. 1268</a>, 1273A - "or otherwise dealt with so that there is a danger that the plaintiff, if he gets judgment, will not be able to get it satisfied"- which formed the basis of the learned judge's judgment. I am quite satisfied that the whole basis of a "Mareva" injunction is thedanger that property within the jurisdiction will be taken out of the jurisdiction, and it is not a remedy which is to be given merelybecause property is somehow to be put beyond the reach of the plaintiff. It is true that a "Mareva" injunction will be so wordednot merely that the property will not be removed from the jurisdiction by the defendant but that it will not be dealt with withinthe jurisdiction. The purpose of that is to prevent its being removed from the jurisdiction by somebody else. As I say, I do notthink that this is a remedy which was ever understood to be available, in effect, in every case where there is a risk that the defendantwill dispose of property. The Respondent did not very strenuously contend otherwise and the main basis of the Respondent's case hasbeen that the injunction was justified on the basis that it was just and convenient to protect this property as trust property frombeing disposed of.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Once again, I am very doubtful indeed whether there can possibly be a trust. In fact, I am inclined to say definitely that therecannot. An express trust has to be in writing where the trust property is land. There was clearly no written trust in this case andI cannot accept that a constructive trust arises simply because there is no writing relating to an express trust of property. I cansee here no basis for contending that there is a constructive trust, but even if that be wrong I am of the opinion that there isno sufficient ground for the grant of an injunction, and for these reasons I would allow this appeal and set aside the injunctionwhich was granted.</p>    <p align="left">Zimmern, J. :</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> I agree with the learned Vice President that this appeal must be allowed and wish to add firstly that the application for an injunctionto freeze an asset was, as is clear from the decision of the learned Commissioner, argued on the basis of a tortious conspiracy.It appears to me that the court below failed to remember that tort is properly a wrong at Common Law and does not include wrongsredressable in equity. It failed to apply its mind to whether there is such an action in tort as a conspiracy to dispose of a trustproperty in breach of trust.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> A civil conspiracy is an agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. I fail to see howa disposition of property by a trustee whether in breach of trust or otherwise can amount to an unlawful act. Furthermore, in civilconspiracy, an agreement by itself is insufficient. It must be followed by damages that is Common Law damages for the injury sustained.In breach of trust equity provides its own rules.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In my view, the application on the ground of conspiracy was misconceived.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Secondly, I fail to see how a trust was ever constituted. Para. 3 of the Statement of Claim as pleaded is contrary to the evidenceshown in the affidavit. Para. 3 of the Statement of Claims reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"By an instrument dated 23rd of May 1977, ... the 2nd Defendant assigned the property to the 1st Defendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The facts deposed to do not show this at all. What could be said was that, to take a neutral stand here, the parents of the 1st Defendantprovided the money for the purchase of and the assignment of the property to the 1st Defendant for any trust to be properly constitutedin favour of the Plaintiff. Ordinance requires the trust to be in writing. The conveyance was made before the marriage. I agree withthe learned Vice-President. There was nothing in writing and I fail to see how a trust was ever constituted in favour of the Plaintiffor that she, as a volunteer, could become a beneficiary under a constructive trust. Even if I am wrong in all these matters, I furtherfail to see how a "Mareva" injunction could have been granted. Both the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, the husband were volunteers.The money was provided by the 1st Defendant's parents. If the money is back now in the hands of the parents and the Plaintiff hasa claim, she can of course trace the property in equity but there is not the slightest evidence that the property for which she mighteventually trace is in jeopardy and I agree again with all that the learned Vice President has said about the protection of the asset.</p>    <p align="left">Power, J. :</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I find myself unable to agree with all that has fallen from the learned Vice-President. I concur with all that he had said with regardto the nature and the jurisdiction to grant a "Mareva" injunction and I am satisfied that there is no such remedy available to thePlaintiff on the facts of the present case. As to the alleged trust and the alleged conspiracy to defeat it I am satisfied, as thematter stands, that there is a serious question to be tried. Should therefore an injunction, not, of course, of the "Mareva" type,issue? I am satisfied that it should not. I am respectfully in agreement that the evidence which the Plaintiff has placed beforethis Court does not constitute sufficient ground to warrant, on the balance of convenience, the grant of an injunction.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">17th July 1981.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Swaine, Q.C. &amp; G.
