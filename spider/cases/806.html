The contention of the defendant in the court below and before me is that the master was wrong andthat the costs of the action should not have been awarded pursuant to Order 62, rule 10 because of the nature of the payment-in bythe defendant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> This is an action where the plaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract and tort in relation to a flight operated by thedefendant, United Air Lines, where she suffered some personal injuries. The defendant made a payment into court. The payment intocourt stated the sum paid in and stated that it is in satisfaction of all causes of action inclusive of interest and costs. It isagreed on all sides that cost is not a cause of action and that it should not have been a subject matter of a payment-in, unlikeinterest which is specially dealt with under Order 22, rule 8. There is, therefore, no dispute that the payment-in was irregularin that it included, in the notice of the payment-in, a reference that the payment-in was inclusive of costs.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> What the plaintiff's solicitors did, therefore, was to write to the defendant, by letter of 28 January, pointing out that the ruledid not permit the defendant to include costs in the payment-in, asking it to rectify the error and say that if within three daysthey have not heard from the defendant, then they would regard the payment-in of that sum as being exclusive of costs and that theplaintiff would act accordingly.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Now at that stage, what the defendant could do was either to say "No, we still regard the payment-in as valid even though it includedcosts and we would insist upon it", or they could say "Yes, we agree it is totally invalid, please disregard this payment-in", orit can apply to the court to have the payment-in withdrawn because it included an element of costs and it may want to make a differentpayment-in to be exclusive of costs and to comply with Order 22, rule 1. It did none of these things. So four days later, the plaintiffpursuant to what her solicitors have written on 28 January, accepted the payment-in. As far as she was concerned, she regarded theacceptance as being exclusive of costs and that pursuant to Order 62, rule 10, she would be entitling to have, as a matter of right,the costs of the action up to the date of payment-in. The dispute between the parties is as to whether, in those circumstances, theplaintiff is entitled as of right to the exercise of the payment of her costs pursuant to Order 62, rule 10.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The five steps set out by Mr Fung in his submission are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">1. that the payment-in was irregular;</p>        <p align="justify">2. that by virtue of the letter of 28 January and the non action of the defendant after 3 days, that irregularity was rectified;</p>        <p align="justify">3. what effect the rectification would have in relation to the payment-in;</p>        <p align="justify">4. whether the acceptance of the payment-in was valid under Order 22, rule 3; and</p>        <p align="justify">5. whether because of the acceptance, therefore Order 62, rule 10 applies and the plaintiff is entitled to costs automatically.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">I think at the end of the hearing, it is clear that only step 2 is in serious dispute, i.e. whether by virtue of the letter of 28January, the irregularity of the payment-in was rectified.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As I understand the case put by Mr Fung, he says that although there was irregularity i.e. the payment-in included costs, by theterms of the letter of 28 January, they said to the defendant : "We will regard the irregularity as being rectified by the deletionof the word 'costs' unless we hear from you within three days". The defendant has not come back within three days and therefore theirregularity was rectified by its silence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr Chung does not agree and says silence cannot confer any right on the parties. I disagree. I think this is a very unusual and specialsituation. This is a case which calls for the defendant to act because otherwise it is leading the plaintiff to believe that, pursuantto the terms of the letter of 28 January, there was a valid payment-in and that the valid payment-in was on terms of the amount exclusiveof costs. The parties, that is the plaintiff as well as the defendant, would then act on the basis that there has been a valid payment-inof that amount exclusive of costs. Whether the plaintiff accepts the payment-in or not, the parties would then act on the basis thatthere was a valid payment-in which would have an effect on the course of action when the action continues if there is no acceptance,and would have another effect if there is acceptance. So it is extremely important that silence of the defendant in those circumstancesis a representation to the plaintiff that the plaintiff can regard the payment-in as a valid payment-in exclusive of costs.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In my view, therefore, the irregularity of the payment-in was rectified and that therefore it is capable of being accepted - in factit was accepted. Mr Fung puts the case on the basis of acquiescence. I think he is entitled to do so : see De Bussche v. Alt  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%208%20ChD%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 8 ChD 286</a>, at 314 in terms of acquiescence in the right being infringed. It can also be put in a different way, perhaps, in one or anotherform of estoppel. But in whatever way it is put, I think the justice of the case requires a view of the steps taken leading to theconclusion that there was a valid payment-in which was capable of being accepted. After all, it would have an extremely importanteffect - whether it was valid or not valid. Assuming for the moment that there was no acceptance of the payment-in, but the parties,by reasons of what had happened, both regard the payment-in as valid. The plaintiff obtains a judgment in the sum of say $5,000 short,inclusive of interest, of the amount paid in. I would have thought that any counsel would be able to stand up before the court andsay that the payment-in had beaten the final judgment and therefore the costs consequence should be that costs after the payment-inshould go to the defendant, that is on the basis on a valid payment-in. I think the defendant cannot have it both ways. If it didnot regard the payment-in as valid and if it did not regard the payment-in after the letter of 28 January as exclusive of costs,then it must say so and act accordingly. It did not. It allowed that plaintiff to believe the payment-in was valid and exclusiveof costs according to the letter of 28 January. The defendant cannot now allege that payment-in was invalid and not capable of beingaccepted by the plaintiff.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In these very special circumstances, I accept the submission of Mr Fung for the plaintiff and I find that there came into operationautomatically the provisions of Order 62, rule 10. The plaintiff therefore succeeds on the application and the appeal should be dismissedwith costs to be taxed it not agreed.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(William Waung)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance,<br />                High Court</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Eugene Fung, instructed by Messrs Dibb Lupton Alsop, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Tommy Chung, instructed by Messrs Peter K.H.
