The Plaintiff, Mr Wang, apparently a person of good standing in the business communityand a member of the Guangxi Committee (HKSAR) of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference, is the owner of a companycalled Joinn Strategic Holdings Limited, which I will refer to as Joinn Strategic.  Joinn Strategic provides corporate advisory andrestructuring services which includes advising companies who wish to be listed on the Stock Exchange here in Hong Kong as well asin Singapore where the Plaintiff says he is also held in high repute.  Joinn Strategic will therefore advise and assist in the preparationof its clientsâ Initial Public Offerings [IPOâs].</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Defendant, Mr Martin Ng Kai Cheung, had previously been employed by a company called Golding Soft Limited as its financial controller. He is a qualified accountant both here and in the United States.  Golding Soft had retained the services of Joinn Strategic to adviseit in getting listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  The Defendant resigned from Golding Soft inDecember 2004.  There is an allegation that he had been having mental problems at the time, but at this stage I am not able to makeany finding or comment about that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Suddenly, in June 2007, e-mails were sent to a large number of banks and regulatory organisations both in Hong Kong and Singaporewhich were highly derogatory of the Plaintiff.  The first e-mail, dated 20 June 2007 was sent to, amongst others, the SFC in HongKong, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited and to banks and stock broking companies.  Thise-mail is at Bundle B, page 4 in its English translation.  It purports to come from Kai Cheung Ng, the address being martinng<a>2008@yahoo.com.cn</a>.  I need to set out its contents here in full:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><b><i><u>Subject: Letâs Report the Scoundrel of the Hong Kong Financial Sector â Wang Lin Jia</u></i></b></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>As an international financial centre, such a scoundrel â Wang Lin Jia appeared in Hong Kong.

This was followed by two other e-mails both on 23 Junewhich were to the same effect.  These are, in translation, at B9 and 14.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On seeing the first e-mail, the plaintiff says that he became very angry and embarrassed by the lies that had been written abouthim and he arranged for the Defendant to come to his offices so that they might discuss the matter.  They met on 22 June a day beforethe two further e-mails were sent.  The Defendant denied that he had sent the e-mail and refused to sign a letter of apology thatthe Plaintiff had prepared.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiff was shown the second and third e-mails on the following day.  What may be significant in due course is that the thirde-mail at 12:12 p.m. referred to the meeting with the Plaintiff the previous day in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Since I sent out this e-mail, this scoundrel contacted me and asked me to sign a declaration to clarify hereby that I did not signany such declaration and the contents of this e-mail are absolutely true.

There was no response to that letter and no telephone contact was possible with the Defendant.  In those circumstances,the Plaintiff issued a writ for libel on 18 July 2007 (HCA 1530/2007 â âthe first writâ).  After that writ was issued, it isthe Plaintiffâs case that the Defendant contacted Mr Vincent Liu, who is the financial controller of Joinn Strategic, and askedfor one more chance.  The Plaintiff says that in view of what he perceived to be the Defendantâs mental instability, he was mindedto give him that chance provided he signed and distributed to the recipients of the e-mails a retraction and an apology.  It is commonground that on 3 August, the Defendant attended the Plaintiffâs solicitorsâ offices and he was presented with an apology letterwhich he also refused to sign because of the references to his mental instability.  Then on 25 August, the Plaintiff received a letterfrom the Defendantâs parents telling him that the Defendant had made a mistake in making defamatory remarks and asking him thePlaintiff to give him a chance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  This was followed up by the Defendant telephoning Mr Liu in late August to say that he was remorseful and that he was willing tosign a letter of apology.  On 30 August, the Defendant signed such a letter at the Plaintiffâs solicitorsâ offices which is atB102-104.

On 13 October, the Plaintiff received a letter from the Defendant dated 10 October [B48-50].  Itis there to be read.  Its tone is highly emotional and apologetic for what he had done to the Plaintiff and expressed the hope thathe might work for the Plaintiff again.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Nevertheless, the matter did not end there.  December and January this year saw the publication of 13 further e-mails basicallyof the same type as the first e-mail on 20 June 2007 which I have set out in paragraph 4 above, most of these going to organisationsoperating in the financial sector in Singapore.  Unsurprisingly, some of the parties who received these e-mails are expressing concernabout the probity of the Plaintiffâs and Joinn Strategicâs conduct.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Defendant has been spoken to by Mr Vincent Liu about these subsequent e-mails and he has denied sending them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Faced with this situation, the Plaintiff has now issued this writ complaining that he has been libelled in 16 e-mails, the firston 20 June 2007 and the final one on 17 January 2008.  It is said on his behalf that he should be granted this interlocutory injunctionas a matter of urgency.  It is intolerable that he should have to put up with what amounts to a campaign of defamation of the worstpossible kind which may have the effect of harming not only his good standing and reputation in the financial sector here in HongKong, in Singapore and on the Mainland but which is also likely to cause him severe financial loss as potential clients look elsewherefor the sort of services that Joinn Strategic provides.  Additionally, these defamatory remarks are said to harm his reputation ina private capacity having regard to part of the content of the e-mails which speak very badly of him in the way he treats women.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Defendantâs Stance</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  This summons was first listed before me on 25 January which was before the Defendant had an opportunity to respond to the Plaintiffand his witnesses affirmations.  On that occasion, it became very clear that the Defendant was contesting the authorship of any ofthese e-mails, thereby raising a most fundamental defence to any libel action.  I adjourned the matter to allow the Defendant tofile evidence in reply which he has by his affirmation of 2 February which confirms his assertion that he is not the author nor thesender of these e-mails and he has provided detailed reasons for saying so.  As to the admission that he signed on 30 August 2007in respect of 3 June 2007 e-mails, he says that he was rather badgered into doing so.  He says that the Plaintiff had told him thatpeople reading these e-mails might believe that their contents were true, including the reference to Golding Softâs fabricatedaccounts for which he had been responsible and in which circumstances he might well find himself in serious trouble.  Consequently,after references to his mental state were removed, he signed the admission on 30 August.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Since the matter was adjourned on 25 January, two further<br />    e-mails have been sent on 27 January and on 4 February to a very considerable number of recipients involved in the financialsector and who are involved in the type of work done by the Plaintiff.  These too are most defamatory in their content.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Now that the matter has proceeded to a hearing before me, the Defendant has pursued the same stance that he is not the author northe sender of this material. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Courtâs Approach in Applications for an Interim Injunction in a Libel Action</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Dykes SC, for the Plaintiff, quite rightly accepts that the regime established in <i>American Cyanamid v Ethicon</i> does not apply in libel cases.  The burden on an applicant for an injunction in a case such as this is a much heavier one.  <i>Gatley</i> [10<sup>th</sup> edition, para. 25.2] puts it in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="86%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="8%" valign="top" class="quote"><b><i>25.2</i></b></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="91%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><b><i>Delicate nature of jurisdiction.</i></b><i>The jurisdiction to grant interim injunctions to restrain publication of defamatory statements is âof a delicate natureâ, whichâought only to be exercised in the clearest casesâ.

The reluctance to grant peremptory injunctions is rooted in the importance attached to the rightof free speech.

Firstly, whether the statementscontained in the e-mails are unarguably defamatory and secondly, whether the evidence is sufficiently compelling to justify a findingthat the Defendant is the author and sender of these e-mails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I should also mention, in order to exclude it, the defence of justification.  The law is that where a defendant contends that thewords complained of are true and swears on affidavit that he will plead and seek at trial to prove the defence of justification,the court will not grant an interlocutory injunction, unless the court is satisfied that such a defence is one that cannot succeed. See <i>Bonnard v Perryman</i> [1891] 2 Ch.269 and, more recently <i>Greene v Associated Press Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20QB%20972" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] QB 972.</a>  Although at paragraph 3 of his affirmation, the Defendant has said that the contents of the e-mails relating to the state of theaccounts of Golding Soft are true in that they present a false picture, which is capable of standing as a partial defence of justificationin relation to that company alone, the defendant insofar as I can discern his position is that he is limiting himself to the evenmore fundamental defence of not being the author and sender of the e-mails.  In these circumstances, the potential, very real difficultythat an applicant for an injunction faces where justification is going to be raised does not exist and I need not say anymore aboutit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Are the Statements Undoubtedly Defamatory?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I can take this shortly.  These are accusations of wholesale dishonesty in the course of the Plaintiffâs profession, togetherwith imputations as to his moral character in relation to the opposite sex.  I find as a matter of law that these statements areunarguably defamatory.  The evidence is all one way in this regard.  This therefore disposes of the first issue in favour of thePlaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Is the Defendant the Author and Sender of These E-mails?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The first question is to decide to what standard of proof this needs to be shown to be the case.  Clearly, it has to be beyond amere <i>prima facie</i> case, or even a good arguable case, as is sometimes looked for in applications for interlocutory injunctions.  Given the courts veryhigh expectations in a libel case before it will be persuaded to make an order of this kind, it seems to me that Mr Dykes needs todemonstrate that, even at this pre-trial stage, and on conflicting affirmations, it is more likely than not, in other words carryingthe civil burden of proof, that the Defendant is the author and sender of these e-mails.  I had wondered, in the course of the argument,whether on this issue the matter is somewhat akin to an Order 14 situation where all the Defendant needs to show is that there isa triable issue as to whether he is the author and if he can demonstrate that, then the outcome will need to go to trial, in whichcase no injunction could go to restrain the Defendant in circumstances where authorship is disputed.  Whichever way one cares toexpress it, the final analysis must be that Mr Dykes needs to carry the day now and demonstrate on the civil burden that the Defendantis the author.  <i>Gatley</i> refers to a need to show that there is no other defence which might succeed [see para. 15 <i>supra.</i>] which indicates the very high burden placed on an applicant for an injunction.  I would have thought that this condition can beno higher than proof by an applicant of a vital ingredient, such as authorship, on the basis of the civil burden and this thereforeis how I propose to approach the evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Analysis of the Evidence at Present</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The starting point for any examination of this kind is the admission of authorship of the June 2007 e-mails by the Defendant inthe letter of 30 August 2007.  The Defendant has sought to explain this as having come about by virtue of pressure brought to bearby the Plaintiff and that he thought that he had better say this was all untrue because he feared that he would be held responsiblefor the fraudulent Golden Soft accounts which he had prepared.  This explanation needs to be weighed by me as part of all of therelevant evidence as a whole that may or, in some instances, may not point to the Defendantâs authorship.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  What I am not prepared to take into account is the letter from the Defendantâs parents, to which I have already referred, confessingto this on his behalf.  They cannot be considered as his agents for this purpose and there is no evidence that they sent this letterwith his authority or consent.  This letter must therefore be excluded from my consideration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Dykes has put in a schedule of evidence which he says points to the Defendant as being the sender and the author of the e-mails. The June e-mails, of course, bear the Defendantâs name and the e-mail address is also in the Defendantâs name together withhis telephone number.  As to the e-mail address, the Defendant has explained that this is not his and that he could not log intoit when he was asked to send out apologies for what he had done and he had to create a new e-mail address which was very similarto the one used by the sender of the June e-mails.  There is evidence from Mr Vincent Liu that a few days after the issue of thefirst writ, the Defendant telephoned him to ask for forgiveness for what he had done.  After that on 30 August 2007, he signed theletter of apology.  On 10 October, the Defendant sent the Plaintiff a letter of apology [B48/50] which, having regard to its contentsand, the surrounding background, clearly serves to confirm the on-going dispute and the Defendantâs authorship of the June e-mails. One then comes to the e-mails dated 19 and 21 December 2007 [B51-59], the contents of these being very similar to those sent inJune although it is right to say that the sending e-mail address does not bear the defendantâs name nor are they signed by him. The e-mail of 17 December is signed by the Defendant [B60-63] notwithstanding the fact that it does not come from the e-mail addressof the June e-mails which contained his name.  The sending e-mail address for 17 December is the same one as for the e-mail on 19and 21 December.  Another e-mail dated 11 January 2008 [B64-68] refers back to the exposure, by the author of this e-mail, of thePlaintiffâs various misdeeds and also tells of having received a threatening telephone call from Mr Liu.  The e-mail of 13 December2007 [B76-77] is signed by Martin Ng.  The e-mail of 30 December 2007 [B87-89] speaks of the author having left the criminal gangin December 2004 â which can be taken as referring to the Defendantâs departure from Golding Soft at that time.  The e-mail of3 September 2007 [B105-107] undoubtedly comes from the Defendant, which he accepts but, it has a slightly different e-mail address,this referring to the Defendantâs evidence that the Martin Ng address on the June e-mails was not his and which he could not loginto, which required him to create another address which is slightly different with the addition of an â<i>h</i>â.  This e-mail also has his mobile telephone number which is the mobile number appearing on the June e-mails.  As to the January2008<br />    e-mails, their contents and allegations are for all intents and purposes identical to the June e-mails.  This includes the mailof 11 January [B64-68] <i>supra.</i> which refers to the telephone call with Mr Liu in which Mr Liu is said to have threatened him.  As to this, Mr Liu says in his affirmationthat the Defendant was the only person that he had telephoned about these defamatory e-mails, which must point, in a conclusive way,to the Defendant being the author of this e-mail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Dykes has also relied on the writing on the envelope which contained the letter of apology dated 10 October 2007 [B161-163] aboveis very similar to the handwriting on the Defendantâs tax-return with Golding Soft.  Given the uncertainty of making these sortof comparisons by a layman, I do not propose to take this piece of evidence into account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusions on the Evidence</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The evidence needs to be considered as a whole giving proper weight to the defendantâs explanations and remembering that noneof this evidence has been tested by cross-examination.  In approaching it in this way, I am driven to the conclusion that Mr Dykeshas carried the burden on a balance of probabilities, even at this stage, of showing that the Defendant is the author of all thedefamatory e-mails.  Whatever the Defendant may say in his affirmation and in his address to the court, the only sensible conclusionthat one is able to arrive at on the whole of the evidence is that he is the author.  He has admitted to the June e-mails and subsequentlyapologised for them by his retraction e-mail of 3 September and by his letter of apology on 10 October.  As to the December and Januarye-mails, it is really asking too much to suggest that somebody else has taken up cudgels against the Plaintiff.  The e-mails arepart of a pattern of behaviour by this Defendant which should now be checked by injunction.  Even after the hearing of 25 Januarylast he has, on my finding, sent two further<br />    e-mails.  I am satisfied that there is every prospect that this damaging<br />    e-mail traffic will continue unless stopped by the injunction that is asked for by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Are the Singapore E-mails Actionable Here?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  This can also be taken shortly.  There is expert legal opinion from Singapore that these e-mails constitute an actionable libelin that jurisdiction.  Of course, they are actionable in Hong Kong and so according to <i>Boys v Chaplin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%203%20WLR%20322" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 3 WLR 322</a> a tort committed abroad (in relation to the e-mails sent to Singaporean recipients) is actionable in Hong Kong if it is actionablein Singapore and in our jurisdiction.
