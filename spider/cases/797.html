The Defendant and the Plaintiffâs husband (âtheHusbandâ) and a company of which he is a director and shareholder are currently engaged in litigation concerning patent rightsover a childrenâs toy (âthe Patent Actionâ).  The Plaintiff is not involved in that action.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Plaintiff claims against the Defendant damages for nuisance, harassment and libel; and an injunction restraining the Defendantâsunlawful conduct. Such unlawful conduct comprised:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   Sending of unwarranted emails;</p>        <p>(ii)   Making unwelcomed visits to the Plaintiffâs workplace;</p>        <p>(iii)   Making an unwelcomed visit to the Plaintiffâs home.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Between 19 April and 9 July 2011, the Defendant sent 10 emails to the Plaintiff.  Of those, 8 were also sent to 6 of the Plaintiffâscolleagues and an association in Hong Kong of which the Plaintiff is chairperson.  In those emails, the Defendant accused the Husbandof criminal conduct which ruined the Defendantâs life.  There were also attacks on the Husbandâs moral life.  The Plaintiff wasaccused of sharing in the proceeds of her Husbandâs alleged crimes and her sons as accomplices.  The emails alleged that the Plaintiffdestroyed another family with her unlawful action.  She was associated with the management of the Husbandâs business and the PatentAction.  The Defendant said that the Plaintiff had failed to educate the Husband and the children properly and therefore was notqualified to teach her subject.  The Defendant threatened to ask the police to search the university campus, to make the matter ascandal and publicize the matter on international TV and information network if the Husband did not repay him.  The Defendant accusedthe Plaintiff of putting shame on the University and that the damages caused by her Husband involved her employer and would involveher employer for a long, long time.  An email dated 2 July intimated that the Defendant was demanding the University and the Plaintiffâsinsurance company to be responsible for the loss of education of the Defendantâs daughter and moral prejudice to him.  The Defendantstated that he had given a professorâs details to the journalist in order that the University might satisfy the curiosity of thejournalist directly.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendant allegedly went to the University and forced himself onto the Plaintiffâs colleagues.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendant also made an unwelcomed and uninvited visit to the Plaintiffâs home to serve the papers in relation to the PatentAction.  He made the domestic helper stand with the Court documents in her hands so that he could take a photo of her.  It scaredthe domestic helper.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendantâs conduct has led the Plaintiff to feel insecure physically and stressed and she went on medication for a month. She also felt concerned about her reputation.  She had to continuously apologize to her employer and colleagues for the disturbance.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Defendant denies forcing himself onto the Plaintiffâs colleagues but does not deny sending the 10 emails.  He claims thathe has been cheated by the Husband and such conduct affected his and his familyâs lives and business.  He said that at the Plaintiffâspersuasion, the Husband had entered into a partial settlement with the Defendant.  The Plaintiff also accessed the emails the Defendantsent her through the Husbandâs company.  The Defendant could not believe that the Plaintiff had no knowledge about the Husbandâsbusiness/litigation.  He admits that he was not being nice but claims that what he did was lawful.  He saw injustice and exposedthe truth.  He relies on the law of France âthat imposes the professors to report any risk in relation with children and students.â There is no penalty for âalerting the staff of a university about the questionable ethic of a professor in charge of students.â</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 29 July 2011, the Defendant gave an undertaking to Suffiad J: (1) not to directly communicate or approach the Plaintiff and (2)not to communicate with the academic and administrative staff of the University concerning or in relation to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Defendant sent another email to the Plaintiff on 5 August again making allegations of criminal conduct against the Husband. Worse still, since the month of August, there has been emails from persons claiming to be the Defendantâs wife, daughter and fatherto the Plaintiff, copied to the same senior and staff members of the University.  They made attacks on the Plaintiff similar to thosemade by the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 12 August, I imposed an interim injunction (âthe Interim Injunctionâ) on the Defendant in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   That the Defendant, whether by himself or his servants, agents or family members, relatives or friends or any of them be restrainedfrom intimidating or otherwise interfering with the Plaintiff and her direct family members; and communicating with her or any academicand administrative staff of the University in any manner in relation to the Plaintiff;</p>        <p>(ii)   That the Defendant be restrained from procuring, aiding, abetting or inciting any third party to do the things in the precedingsub-paragraph.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant contests the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the Plaintiffâs claims.  On the other hand, the Plaintiff asksfor continuation of the Interim Injunction.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE JURISDICTION SUMMONS</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Tests</i></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The 3-stage test for deciding whether Hong Kong is the appropriate forum for trial are well-known:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>I.

See <i>Noble Power Investments Ltd v. Nissei Stomach Tokyo Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%205%20HKLRD%20631" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 5 HKLRD 631</a>; <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i>,para 11/1/10.   Mr. Justice Ma CJHC (as he then was) had this to say,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â21. Questions of jurisdiction and forum (that is, the appropriate forum to hear the dispute) are relevant in the exercise of thecourtâs discretion in this regard and, in most cases, this is perhaps the most important factor to be considered by the court whendeciding whether or not to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.</p>        <p class="quote">22. In this context, the following points should be emphasized:</p>        <p class="quote">(1) Where a plaintiff institutes proceedings in Hong Kong as of right, the defendant may challenge the jurisdiction of the Hong Kongcourts to hear the claim in the sense that it may be argued that there is an alternative forum which ought, in preference to HongKong, to deal with the claim. This usually arises where the defendant relies on the existence of a foreign jurisdiction clause oron the principle of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> Such a challenge is based on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to stay an action in Hong Kong where the interests of justiceso dictate. When the Rules of the High Court are revised consequent on the Civil Justice Reform in Hong Kong, such applications willbe made under O.12 r.8. The burden is on the applying party (the defendant) to demonstrate that a stay should be granted.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Where, however, a plaintiff institutes proceedings in Hong Kong <i>not</i> as of right (and the present case is one since leave to serve out of the jurisdiction was required), the approach of the court toquestions of forum is quite different. Although this point will often only be raised by a defendant who seeks to set aside any ordergranting leave to serve out, the burden will not be on the defendant to demonstrate that there is an alternative forum which oughtto entertain the action. Rather, the legal burden is all along on the plaintiff to show, in seeking to persuade the court to grantan order to serve out, that Hong Kong is clearly the appropriate forum for the trial of the action. As Lord Goff of Chieveley putit in a well-known passage in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 460</a>, at p.481E:</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">The effect is, not merely that the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff to persuade the court that England is the appropriate forumfor the trial of the action, but that he has to show that this is clearly so. In other words, the burden is, quite simply, the obverseof that applicable where a stay is sought of proceedings started in this country as of right.</p>		</blockquote>                <p class="quote">(3) The reason for this difference in approach is that unlike the situation wherein the plaintiff sues the defendant in Hong Kongas of right, in an O.11 situation (where the plaintiff requires leave), the defendant is by definition a foreigner who âowes noallegianceâ to Hong Kong (in that he is not automatically subject to the courtâs jurisdiction here). The court must accordinglyin this latter situation be careful not to subject that defendant to what may be an âexorbitantâ jurisdiction (for example, theinconvenience or annoyance of litigating in Hong Kong rather than in his own country): see <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v. Cansulex Ltd</i>. at p.481 B-D.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  With the above principles in mind I proceed to analyze the causes of action to see if they fall within these tests.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Claims for Nuisance and Harassment</i></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The unwelcomed visits to the Plaintiff allegedly took place in Hong Kong.  However, at her home, it was the domestic helper whowas frightened and not the Plaintiff who was harassed.  At her workplace, it was allegedly the colleagues who were forced upon bythe Defendant, again not the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The emails belong to a different category.  They do create harassment (in the ordinary English sense) to the Plaintiff in termsof their frequency and contents. However, indisputably, they were not written or sent by the Defendant in Hong Kong.  Neither werethey opened by the Plaintiff in Hong Kong. As pointed out by the Defendant, the Plaintiff appears to have opened the emails in questionthrough the server of the Husbandâs company when she was in Europe.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  What is more, harassment is not a stand-alone tort.  The Plaintiff seems to have classified it as a form of private nuisance.  However,nuisance is an act that unduly interferes with the use or enjoyment of land: <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort,</i> 20<sup>th</sup> ed, para 20-01.  In <i>Khorasandjian v. Bush</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20QB%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] QB 727</a>,harassment by telephone calls was held to be an actionable interference with an 18 year old girlâs ordinary and reasonable useand enjoyment of her home where she was lawfully present as a licensee.  That case was overruled by the House of Lords which heldthat a plaintiff was required to prove an interest in land or a right to exclusive possession of property and not just a mere licenseto occupy: <i>Hunter &amp; ors v. Canary Wharf Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20655" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] A.C. 655.</a><i> </i> The position in England has since been overtaken by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.  The Hong Kong position is still governedby common law.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  There is no proof as yet that the Plaintiff has exclusive possession to her residence at the staff quarters or at her workplace.  It is questionable whether she has sustainable causes of action in nuisance and/or harassment.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Claim in Libel</i></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The intention of the emails was to tarnish the Plaintiffâs reputation as a person and cast doubt on her fitness to be a professor. In the email dated 13 July 2011 (subsequent to the writ), the Defendant stated that he managed to âexpose the through (sic, shouldbe âthe truthâ) and lies that will disqualify [the Plaintiff] as professor, being admitted that teaching human sciences requesta minimum of intellectual honest; or this is just fake.â  His intention could not be clearer.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Even if the Defendant could prove his case against the Husband, there is nothing in law to make the Plaintiff (or any family member)liable for his or his companyâs acts.  Still less should the University be informed or troubled with the dispute between the Defendantand Husband.  The Defendant clearly intended to associate the Plaintiff and other people connected with the Husband with unlawfulconduct yet to be proved to serve his personal vendetta against the Husband.  In so doing, he disparages the Plaintiffâs reputationin the eyes of fair-minded people, including her colleagues.   The emails were defamatory in nature.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  An alleged defamation is to be regarded as having been committed in the place where the publication comes to the attention of thereader of an internet posting and not where the web server is located: <i>Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. v. Gutnick</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2002/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] HCA 56</a>, High Court of Australia; <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i>,para 11/1/28A.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In the present case, the emails were sent to the addresses of the Plaintiff and her colleagues at the University server, clearlyintending the recipient to download and read them there.  Damage to the Plaintiffâs reputation would have occurred in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Defendant submits that there was no evidence that his emails to the Plaintiffâs colleagues had been received or read.  Withrespect, libel is actionable per se. Publication being the gist of libel, the cause of action arises immediately the publicationhas taken place.  See <i>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander,</i> 11<sup>th</sup> ed, para 3.6 and 6.1.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Stage I Test - The Proper Forum</i></p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  At least in relation to the claim for libel, there is a sustainable cause of action and the Hong Kong Court has jurisdiction. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The libel and damage to reputation occurred in Hong Kong. Hong Kong law applies instead of French law.  The likely witnesses forthe Plaintiff will be herself and her colleagues in Hong Kong.  The Defendant has addresses in France and Shenzhen.  There is nodifficulty in his coming to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is clearly and distinctly the most natural and appropriate forum to litigate theclaim in libel.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The Defendant suggests having the proceedings in Paris because he has no comfort having the trial in Hong Kong.  He has alreadyone action and he does not want to spend 10 years to fight a case with the Plaintiff.  He has not seen his family in France for ayear.  He refers to an experience with an ex parte application in front of a judge when he was unprepared but was handed documentswithout notice.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  To my mind, the Defendant has not shown what connection this case has with Paris or any other jurisdiction.  His concern with thetime needed for litigation can be allayed by proper case management by the Court.  His description of the ex parte applications (Ibelieve is for interim injunctions in the Patent Action and this case) was not out of the ordinary under Hong Kong law. The Courtdid provide opportunities for him to address it in inter parte hearings such as the present one.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Stage I test has been satisfied.  There is nothing to consider under Stage II.  The Defendant has not shown anything under StageIII to tip the balance against having a trial in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The Reliefs Sought by the Defendant on the Jurisdiction Summons</i></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Defendant has asked for specific declarations as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   That the Plaintiff has not brought sufficient evidence that the Defendant has breached Hong Kong law inside the Hong Kong territoryand jurisdiction.</p>        <p>(ii)   That the orders of the Court do not apply outside of the jurisdiction.</p>        <p>(iii)   That the Hong Kong Court has no authority to restrain:</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">ââ the family, friends of collaborators of the defendant; representing a group of around 20 peoples in France USA; Iran; Australia;Israel; Turkey and China;</p>			<p class="quote">â to independently accede to the email address used by the defendant and the group as a privileged exchange platform for heavy documents;said email address and documents being domiciliated by Google in a server in USA;</p>			<p class="quote">â To independently download and store any of the contents exposed to the group including the court documents sent without any allowanceto this âsemi publicâ address by the plaintiffs.</p>			<p class="quote">â Any member of the group to independently transfer any document received to any public address available on any public websites;including to the addresses of the [University] staff; disclosed to the international public by the university.â</p>		</blockquote>                <p>(iv)   That the Plaintiff has not brought sufficient evidence that any email sent by the Defendant has been opened and read by therecipients in Hong Kong.</p>        <p>(v)   That the Plaintiff has affirmed that the emails have been downloaded and opened and read by the Plaintiff outside of the jurisdiction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Defendant also asks that the claims be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  With regard to the proposed declaration (i), the Plaintiff has, at this interlocutory stage, produced sufficient evidence to supporther case on libel. As analyzed above, the Plaintiff sustained damage in Hong Kong so as to found jurisdiction in proceeding here.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  With regard to the proposed declaration (ii), whether or not the orders of the Court apply outside jurisdiction is a question ofenforcement which we are not concerned with at this stage.  It is not a ground for denying the Hong Kong Court jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  With regard to the proposed declaration (iii), I believe the Defendant is suggesting that this Court cannot impose an injunctionon his âfamily membersâ and others.  He claims that there are people who shared his email account and password.  I do note thatthe family members have not been made defendants to this action. However, there is clear evidence that it was the Defendant who fedhis family members with information on his case with the Husband and this case so as to prompt emails from his family members thathas the effect of defaming the Plaintiff.  In so doing, the Defendant was in fact in breach of the usual undertaking in confidentialityas a party, namely, not to disclose information obtained in this case except for the purpose of this case.  He is also aggravatinghis acts of defamation.  The Court does have power to restrain the Defendant and persons acting through him from doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  With regard to the proposed declaration (iv), it is true that there is no such evidence.  However, libel is actionable per se. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  With regard to the proposed declaration (v), it is true that the Plaintiff had opened the emails addressed to her when she was notin Hong Kong.  She cannot, of course, rely on these emails from the Defendant to her to found a claim in libel.  However, she canuse these emails to establish the fact of harassment or nuisance (subject to the proof of interest in land as stated above).</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In summary, none of the proposed declarations can justifiably be granted.  The Defendant may have his own sense of grievance basedon his own perception of French law.  He has regrettably mixed up the incidence of liability between individuals and limited companieswhich are separate legal entities.  He also harbours the notion that a wife is liable for the civil wrongs of her husband which isnot part of Hong Kong law.  He may have expectation on how a professor should behave but that was simply not a reason to associatethe Plaintiff with the Husbandâs alleged wrongdoings.  None of the grounds put forth to oppose jurisdiction can withstand scrutiny.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The lack of proof for the claims in harassment and/or nuisance is not a sufficient ground to dismiss (or strike out) the Plaintiffâsclaim at this stage.  Still less is the alleged failure of the Plaintiff to abide by court rules when attempting to serve documentson the Defendant by email.  The Defendantâs application should be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE INJUNCTION SUMMONS</i></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The Plaintiff asks that the Interim Injunction be continued.  She has to show that (i) there are serious questions to be tried;        (ii) damages do not provide adequate remedy; and (iii) the balance of convenience clearly lies in favour of granting an injunction.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Serious Questions to Be Tried</i></p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  As analyzed above, the Plaintiffâs claims on harassment and/or nuisance are questionable as a matter of law.  The evidence ofa single visit by the Defendant to her home to serve court documents might not be sufficient to justify an interim injunction ofthe type granted.  Moreover, as pointed out by the Defendant, there were no particulars of his alleged unwelcomed visit to the University. However, she has a valid cause of action in libel.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Defendant claims that he has told the story of his dispute with the Husband to SCMP but SCMP was not sued in defamation.  Thestory was public and might have consequences on the reputation of the University.  The accountancy of the companies (I take thatto include the Husbandâs companies) were necessarily inside the home of the remaining directors and hence inside the Universitycampus.  There was no harassment to inform the dean of the University of such legal matters, so the Defendant submits.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  With respect, the fact that SCMP was not sued did not affect the fact that the Defendant has libelled the Plaintiff.  That a directorof a company resided inside university campus does not mean the University was involved in anyway and had to be informed of his acts. The Plaintiffâs case is supported by emails emanating from the Defendant the contents of which the Defendant is not yet able tojustify.  There are serious questions to be tried on libel and the Plaintiff does have a strong case on the merits.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Adequacy of Damages as a Remedy</i></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The wrongful acts of the Defendant have caused damage to the Plaintiffâs reputation built up over the years, something clearlyirreparable.  They have affected her concentration on work and her health, and caused her embarrassment in having to apologize toher colleagues.  The University and Plaintiffâs colleagues were also troubled.  Damages will not be a sufficient remedy for thePlaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On the other hand, there will be no damage to the Defendant if an injunction is granted. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>Balance of Convenience</i></p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The Defendant has shown no sign of stopping his email attacks.  He has forwarded to his family members the documents received fromthe Plaintiffâs solicitors by email in support of the application for interim injunction.  It was in breach of a partyâs undertakingof confidentiality and not to use information received except for the purpose for the litigation itself.  The âwifeâ and âdaughterâboth admitted in the emails that they have read the Plaintiffâs affidavits.   His âfamily membersâ have since joined in thescheme of sending disparaging emails to the Plaintiff and her colleagues.  The Plaintiff has never met the Defendantâs wife, daughterand father nor had they been involved in the business venture between the Husband and the Defendant. The words used in their emailsand contents, written in broken English and imperfect grammar, were similar to the style and format previously used by the Defendant.It can be inferred that the Defendant sent the documents to his family members to prompt their attacks on the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The balance of convenience is clearly in favour of granting an injunction pending trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Terms of the Interim Injunction</i></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The interim injunction should be continued until trial.  To put things beyond doubt, I make a slight adjustment so that in paragraph2, after the words âthird partyâ, there shall be added âincluding but not limited to the Defendantâs wife [name], daughter[name] and father [name]â.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>COSTS</i></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Costs should follow the event and be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff with regard to both applications.  With regard to theDefendantâs application, I summarily assess costs in the sum of $28,000.  With regard to the Plaintiffâs application, I summarilyassess costs (including costs reserved on 15 July 2011, 29 July 2011 and 12 August 2011) in the sum of $80,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I dismiss the Defendantâs summons.   I order that the interim injunction do continue subject to changes in the wording statedin paragraph 48 above. The Defendant shall pay costs of $108,000 to the Plaintiff as costs for both summonses within 14 days.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I thank counsel for her assistance.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>	    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Queeny Au-Yeung)<br />			Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>		<p> </p>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p>Ms Elizabeth Anne Herbert instructed by Messrs Oldham, Li &amp; Nie for the Plaintiff</p>		<p>Defendant appearing in person</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->		<p> </p>    <div>        <br clear="all" />        <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />        <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>    The Defendant was eventually served personally in Hong Kong on 17 August 2011.</p>    </div>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/636.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
