It is the Plaintiff's casethat the 2nd Defendant who is also a tour operator was acting as the Agent of the 1st Defendant when providing services in Chinain relation to the Tour.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> After arrival on the first day at the Shanghai Guesthouse near to Pak Tang Lake arrangements were made for the group to go to theEthnic Village on the other side of the Lake.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> A Speedboat owned and operated by the 3rd Defendant was to convey the group across the Lake to the Ethnic Village. There were 24people in the group and the speedboat could only accommodate 8 passengers. It was therefore necessary for the speedboat to providea shuttle service to transport all of the group across the Lake.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Miss Ho and her friends were in the speedboat when it made its third and last journey.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> While the journey was being undertaken the speedboat came into collision with a fishing junk. As a consequence of this Miss Ho andanother lady passenger were drowned.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Plaintiff, who obtained Letters of Administration to her daughters estate brings the present action under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap. 22</a> and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform Consolidation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The action against the 1st Defendant is for both breach of contract and for negligence and for negligence against the 2nd and 3rdDefendants. Default judgments have been entered against both these Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The main issue in the action against the 1st Defendant is whether they can be held liable for the acts of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff gave evidence herself and called as witnesses 2 of the 3 girls who had been with her daughter at the time of the accident.The 3rd girl Miss Sin was not available as a witness as she is presently studying in the U.S.A. She did, however, make a statementwhich was entirely consistent with the evidence of the other 2 girls and Mr. Chan for the 1st Defendant did not oppose in being introducedas evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The first of the girls to give evidence was Miss Chan Yee Ling. In 1988 she was a school mate of Miss Ho. She gave evidence thatthe 4 girls had proceeded to the border by coach. The tour leader was Miss Chan Siu Yin, an employee of the 1st Defendant. Therewere altogether 24 persons in the group.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> After clearing formalities at the border there had been some delay as they had not known which coach to board on the other side.Eventually, they did board a coach. Shortly thereafter a tour guide boarded the coach and introduced himself as Mr. Ho. He said thathe would be their guide on the tour.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> After luncheon at the Zhong Shan Hot Springs Hotel they had gone on by coach to the Shanghai Guesthouse. There had been some delayen route and this resulted in their late arrival at the Guesthouse.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Ho had then instructed them to quickly deposit their luggage at the Guesthouse as it was proposed that they should go on to theEthnic Village as soon as possible. To get there they would be taken across the Lake on the Ferry.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> They did as requested by Mr. Ho. On arrival at the Pak Tang Lake Pier Mr. Ho informed them that both the ferry and the tour coachhad already departed for the Ethnic Village. This being the case there was no alternative but for them to proceed in 3 groups of8 in a speedboat to cross the Lake.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Some of the other members of the Tour had objected to this. Their objections were over ruled by Mr. Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The first two trips by the speedboat had gone ahead without any apparent problems. As the girls had wanted to stay together theywaited for the third trip.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> At the conclusion of the second trip the Driver of the speedboat said that he did not intend to take the third trip. A volunteerwas found to take his place. This volunteer had claimed that he knew how to drive a speedboat.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The girls together with Mr. Ho and the remaining members of the Tour had got into the speedboat and it then started its journey acrossthe Lake.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It was Miss Chan's impression that the speedboat was travelling at a very high speed. It seemed to be racing with another speedboat.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> She remembered seeing a Fishing Junk in front of them. The next thing she knew was that they had collided with the junk. The occupantsof the speedboat were thrown into the water.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> After much difficulty Miss Chan and 2 of her friends had managed to board the junk where Mr. Ho was. She then realised that MissHo and another lady were missing.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> They had then attempted to get the men on the junk to take measures to rescue Miss Ho and the other lady. These efforts had beento little avail. She subsequently learnt that the bodies of Miss Ho and the other lady had been recovered and that they had drowned.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Miss Chan Wai Ying gave very similar evidence to Miss Chan Yee Ling. Although both ladies were subjected to extensive cross examinationtheir evidence was not in any way shaken. Both of them resisted the suggestion made to them by Mr. Chan that Mr. Ho had been requestedby members of the group to take them to the Lake to go on a speedboat. They were adamant that their version of events had been thecorrect one and that the journey by speedboat had been part of the tour and that they had had no practical alternative but to agreeto go as directed by Mr. Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> They were both excellent witnesses and I accept their evidence as being truthful and reliable in all respects.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The Plaintiff also gave evidence. This mainly related to the amount of damages which would be payable if she succeeds in establishingliability on the part of the 1st Defendant. I propose dealing with this evidence later in this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Evidence for the 1st Defendant was limited to the oral evidence of Mr. Wong Shu Leung, now the Assistant General Manager of the 1stDefendant and to the statement of Mr. Ho, the guide which was admissible by virtue of a hearsay notice as he is beyond the jurisdictionof the Court as he resides in China.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The only significant variation in the evidence of Mr. Ho to the girls' evidence I have referred to is that Mr. Ho stated that someof the members of the Group proposed to him at the Shanghai Guesthouse that they should go on the speedboats at the Lake and thatthis was the reason they went. He was not prepared to state that going on the speedboat had been an integral part of the tour. Havingheard the evidence of the 2 young ladies I have no hesitation in accepting that there evidence is to be preferred to the evidenceof Mr. Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The evidence given by Mr. Wong was of limited assistance. He had not been at Pak Tang Lake in August 1988 and could not even rememberbeing debriefed by Miss Chan Siu Yin, the Tour leader. Indeed he could not remember anything much about her.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> His evidence was therefore mainly confined to a description of the way in which tours were organised and the relationship subsistingbetween the 1st Defendant and the parties in China providing services to the Tours organised by the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Mr. Wong attempted to absolve the 1st Defendant from all responsibility for what had happened. He placed some reliance upon the Agreementwhich he claimed governed the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> As the Agreement is a short one it is worth extracting it in full.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" <u>CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT</u></p>        <p class="quote">China Travel Services Company (Zhong Shan) (hereinafter called Party A) and Kwan Kin Travel Services Limited (hereinabove called PartyB) upon organising tours to Zhong Shan, Zhuhai for visiting proceed upon negotiation and came to the following agreement:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1.

He claimed that the responsibility passed into the hands of the 2nd Defendant which wasa well constituted and responsible organisation.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The role of the 1st Defendant was mainly confined to agreeing with the 2nd Defendant what attractions could be included in a tourand then negotiating an appropriate tariff. They also, of course, received remuneration from persons going on the Tours.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Mr. Wong also emphasised that as there was no reference in the Company's brochure describing this tour to trips on the Lake it couldnot be said that the trip on the speedboat formed part of the Tour. As I have already indicated I have accepted the evidence givenby the 2 Miss Chans and I have no doubt that the trip on the speedboat was indeed part of the Tour package. It is not realistic toexpect every single activity to be described in the brochure. A more meaningful test is to consider what actually happened. If theevidence of the girls is accepted, which is indeed the case, there can be no doubt in my mind that the journey on the speedboat wasan integral part of the guided tour provided by the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> This aspect of the matter led to what was in my opinion one of the least satisfactory parts of Mr. Wong's testimony.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> On the one hand he insisted that the speedboat trip was not part of the tour. Indeed at one stage in his evidence he claimed thatin August 1988 he had no knowledge that there were any speedboats at Pak Tang Lake for the use of customers.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> On the other hand, he claimed that the 1st Defendant could not be liable as they had taken every reasonable precaution to satisfythemselves that the speedboats were operated safely.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The latter part of paragraph 8 of the written statement which Mr. Wong adopted as his evidence stated :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The navigator of the speedboat involved in the accident was employed by the 3rd Defendant and the 1st Defendant had no connectionwith him at all. However, the 1st Defendant could not see any thing inherently dangerous in touring Pak Tang Lake by speedboat andwas quite satisfied after careful consideration by its management including myself that such would be safe unless there was any casualnegligence by those running the service. Certainly the 1st Defendant's management could not foresee and did not foresee the navigatorof the speedboat in question would be negligent in controlling the speedboat, if at all, which is not admitted."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I regret that it was definitely my impression that Mr. Wong's evidence was tailored to meet what he considered to be most advantageousto the 1st Defendant's case rather than attempting to give truthful and accurate testimony. As a consequence of this I was reluctantto accept the validity of much of his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> To be more specific I do not believe that the 1st Defendant undertook sufficient measures to ensure that members of their guidedtours were adequately protected while they were in China. I believe that so long as the 1st Defendants received their share of thepayments made by members taking their tours, they did very little to safeguard their interests.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In this connection I do not consider that any adequate measures were taken to ensure that a safe system of operation was providedfor the operation of the speedboat on the Lake which I have found to be an integral part of the Tour.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I will next consider whether this finding of fact has legal implications.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I accept the validity of the submission made by Miss Eu, Q.C. for the Plaintiff that the 1st Defendant did owe Miss Ho a primaryand contractual duty to take reasonable care for her safety which included taking satisfactory measures to ensure that if speedboatswere used on the tour they would be operated by persons of reasonable competence and experience.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The principles relating to this are conveniently encapsulated in paragraph 3.35 of the 16th Edition of <u>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts Sweet &amp; Maxwell</u> 1989.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3-35 Exceptions to the general rule. To the general rule that an employer is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractorthere are certain apparent exceptions. It is submitted, however, that these are not true exceptions (at least so far as the theoreticalnature of the employer's liability is concerned) for they are dependent upon a finding that the employer is, himself, in breach ofsome duty which he personally owes to the plaintiff. The liability is thus not truly a vicarious liability and is to be distinguishedfrom the vicarious liability of a master for his servant. (Staveley Iron and Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20AC%20627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] A.C. 627</a>; Salsbury v.

See ante, Â§ 3-33; Barak, loc. cit., supra. n. 92. Cf. Atiyah, op.cit. p.338.) If the circumstances are such that the law imposes a strict or absolute duty upon the employer, then he cannot dischargehis duty by delegating performance of the work in question to an independent contractor. If, therefore, the duty is not fulfilled,the employer is liable even though the immediate cause of the damage is the contractor's wrongful act or omission. Such strict orabsolute duties are often described as "non- delegable" and may arise either by statute or at common law. For present purposes theyare to be contrasted with the ordinary duty to take reasonable care which can be discharged by the employment of a contractor reasonablysupposed by the employer to be competent. At the least the non-delegable duty is "a duty not merely to take care, but a duty to providethat care is taken," (Per Langton J. in The Pass of Ballater [1942] P.112, 117.) so that, if care is not taken, the duty is broken."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> A good illustration of how the principles can be applied can be seen from the judgment of Eveleigh L.J. at p.328 of <u>Rogers v.

The judge said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">They do make it their business to ensure drivers have had a driving licence for two years, private hire insurance and MOT from timeto time to make sure they [the cars] are clean and tidy. That is their only interest. They are not concerned with what is chargedexcept by laying down a general tariff. They take no cut, they have no control over what the driver does. They have a preferentialagreement with a garage to deal with drivers' cars'.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">So that there is a rather deeper involvement by the defendants in this case than that of being a mere post box, but I, for the purposesof my judgment, do not think that that factor has any great importance.</p>        <p class="quote">The judge continued:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">The relationship between the defendants and the drivers is what is known to law as that of independent contractor. The employer isnot in the normal way liable except when under a strict or absolute duty ... I am not able to find that the circumstances here aresuch that the law imposes strict liability to ensure that vehicles are safe or safely maintained ... It seems to me all the firmare doing is putting one member of the public in touch with another - that is all they do and I cannot spell out of that a duty toensure vehicles are maintained at every time.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In my opinion, this is not a case where we are concerned to consider vicarious liability or whether there is liability for the actof an independent contractor. We are concerned to consider a case of primary duty on the part of the defendants. It was never suggested,and it was not put to the plaintiff, that she knew that the defendants were simply a kind of post box to put her in touch with someoneelse with whom she would be able to make an independent contract. On the facts of this case, in my opinion, the defendants undertookto provide a car and driver to take the plaintiff to her destination. They did not undertake, and neither did she request them, toput her in touch with someone else who would undertake this obligation. Now in those circumstances of undertaking to provide a carand its driver to take her to her destination the defendants could foresee that she might be injured if the vehicle were defective,and so they owed a duty arising out of this relationship to take care to see that the vehicle was safe. They relied upon the driverto do this. Whether he was a servant or an independent contractor matters not, he was a third person upon whom they relied to performtheir duty arising from their relationship with the plaintiff, and it is well-established law that such a duty cannot be delegated.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is possible to treat this case as one of contract and to say that the plaintiff and defendants entered into a contract wherebythe defendants would provide a car for reward for a purpose and an implied term that the vehicle would be reasonably fit for thatpurpose. It is said that the vehicle would be reasonably fit for that purpose. It is said that the case has not been pleaded in contract.It is true the words 'breach of contract' were not used. It is also said that breach of contract was not argued in the court below,but to my mind it does not matter on the facts of this case. What was clearly set out in the pleadings was that the plaintiff hadhired a minicab from a firm who were in the minicab business and that the defendants were in breach of a duty to take care that thevehicle provided was properly maintained."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Adotping these principles I am satisfied that the 1st Defendant should be held liable for the consequences of this tragic accident.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> In coming to this conclusion I have borne in mind that the 1st Defendant has clearly been in breach of its primary duty to providesatisfactorily the basic services they were obliged to supply. There was no evidence that any attempt was made to ensure that thespeedboat which was being used as part of the Transportation was operated in a safe manner or that a safe system of operation wasadhered to.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> I was not prepared to grant leave to the 1st Defendant to amend its defence to enable it to plead what in Mr. Chan's submission amountedto an exemption clause. I gave reasons for this refusal during the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> However, I do not think that this ruling is likely to have much bearing on the outcome of the case as the clause is couched in vagueand unsatisfactory terms.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> At the conclusion of his submission and on the basis it was unsuccessful, Mr. Chan requested me to make an Order under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a> ordering that as between the Defendants, the 3rd Defendant who was most culpable of the Defendants should be required tocontribute 100% towards damages which are awarded. The other Defendants were aware of the present hearing and had been informed thatsuch an application may be made. Having regard to all the surrounding circumstances I am prepared to make an Order to this effect.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I will now consider what damages should be payable. Clearly damages have to be considered under both the Fatal Accident Ordinance<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap. 22</a> and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The Plaintiff gave helpful evidence in this connection. She described her daughter as having been filial. She believed that but forthis tragic accident she would have been happy to contribute financially towards the well being of the family. Her 2 sons who wereyounger than the Deceased, both make financial contributions to the family. They are both Police Officers and they each contribute$3,000 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> I got the impression from the Plaintiff's testimony that she accepted that in all probability her daughter would have left schoolafter Form 5 and gone out to work. She had been interested in advertising design work and had hoped to pursue a career in this field.I can see no reason whatever to doubt this.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The Plaintiff's solicitors in the Schedule of Damages which they prepared based their calculations on the assumption that Miss Ho'sstarting salary would have been $4,000 per month and that by this year her salary would have increased to $8,000 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> While it is impossible to be precise in calculations of this nature I do not think that these figures are seriously flawed. I haveborne in mind the evidence of both of Miss Ho's friends who could fairly be said to have had very similar financial expectationsto her. Miss Chan Yee Ling who is in marketing had a starting salary of $3,500 in 1989 and earns $8,500 at the present time. MissChan Wai Ying is earning rather more than this as she is a Police Officer. I accept, however, that Police Officers receive some recompensefor the unsociable hours they have serve and also for the hazardous and onerous nature of their duties. I would not be disposed tointerfere with the calculations made by the Plaintiff's solicitors in this respect.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> They go on to contend that Miss Ho would have contributed $1,500 to $3,000 every month of which not more than $500 would have beenattributable to her own needs.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Having regard to the financial needs of the parents and the contributions made by the sons, I also consider this assumption to bereasonable.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> So far as Pre trial dependency is concerned the median figure for dependency is therefore $1,750 and 51 months would elapse fromthe date she would have started work to the date of trial.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> This leads to an award of $1,750 x 51 = $89,250.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> As to Post trial dependency the solicitors proposed adopting a multiplier of 12 years. This was based upon her father being aged51 and the Plaintiff being 45.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> My initial impression was that this multiplier was too high on account of the fact that in all probability Miss Ho was likely tohave married and perhaps had children well within this time frame had she lived.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> However, on further reflection I do not think that this is a factor which should weigh heavily in the scales.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> There is no reason to suppose that Miss Ho would have married a poor man and having regard to the fact that the parents needs wouldcontinue notwithstanding any such contingency, it is probable that financial contributions would have continued after her marriage.It is also likely that she would continue working after marriage as most girls do now.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I have now come to the conclusion that a multiplier of 12 is fair in all the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> I agree with the solicitors that an appropriate multiplicand would be $2,500.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> My calculation under this head would therefore be,</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>12 x 12 - 51 x 2500 = $232,500.00.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> The claim for bereavement of $70,000 is not contested by Mr. Chan. I also consider it is reasonable and would allow it as claimed.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> A claim is made for $30,000 for pain and suffering. Adopting the reasoning in <u>Chim Kwan Tai v. Li Fung Electronic Factory</u> &amp; Others  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1987%20HKLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1987 HKLR 1</a>, it is difficult to see how this claim can succeed. There is no evidence that Miss Ho survived the initial impact between the speedboatand the junk and I do not believe that a claim under this head can succeed. It is accordingly dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The next head for me to consider is the Claim for Accumulation of Wealth.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> In the schedule of damages it is proposed that it should be calculated on the basis that Miss Ho would have been able to save 15%of her earnings.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> While I accept the Plaintiff's evidence that her daughter was of a frugal disposition, I do not think that it is right to base thiscalculation on 15%.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> My reason for this conclusion is that the financial contributions I have allowed for are more generous than would normally be thecase. If Miss Ho was making such generous provision for her parents it is unlikely that she would be able to achieve more than averagesavings. As the customary figure adopted under this head is usually of the order of 10%, I do not see any justification for basingthe calculation at a higher level. I propose basing it on 10%. The median income pre trial is $6,000 per month and therefore thecalculation is,</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>600 x 51 = $30,600.00.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> As to post trial accumulation it was proposed that the multiplier should be either 16 or 17 years. I have considered the more recentauthorities on this and have come to the conclusion that 17 is more appropriate. The calculation is therefore,</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>800 x 153 = $122,400.00.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> Although no receipts were produced a claim for $30,000 is made for funeral expenses. The Plaintiff gave evidence that this expenditurewas incurred.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> I believe her evidence and make an award for this sum under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> The claim for $300 for the lost watch is not disputed and I allow it as claimed.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> Both Miss Eu and Mr. Chan agree that an appropriate rate of interest is 10% which should be halved leaving 5% on pre trial dependencyand accumulation awards and the special damages and that 2% should be payable on any general damages from the date of the issue ofthe writ.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> I also order that these damages are to be payable by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants thus obviating the necessity for any separate assessmentsof damages.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> I make an order nisi that the Plaintiff is to have her costs and that costs shall be taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Simon Mayo)</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>                </tr>            </table>        </center>    </div>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Miss Audrey Eu, Q.C., inst'd by Chan &amp; Chuk for Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr. Chan Chi Hung, inst'd by Ng &amp; Yung for 1st Defendant</p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1993/201.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
