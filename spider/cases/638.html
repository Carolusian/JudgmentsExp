By thefirst judgment the deputy judge struck out the statement of claim in this action and dismissed the action subject to the fact thathe gave the plaintiff 21 days to reformulate its claim in respect of what were referred to as the "Wantong" and "Life Circle" transactions.The plaintiff subsequently applied for an extension of time to apply for any amendment until 21 days from the final determinationof the appeal against the first order. That application was dismissed by the deputy judge on 18 June 2002. That dismissal forms thesubject matter of the second appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal this court reserved its decision to be handeddown in writing.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> This action is a claim by a company in liquidation. The defendant had been the auditors in respect of the accounts for the plaintiff'sfinal trading years. The defendant's primary case is that the statement of claim lacks essential averments that would be necessaryto constitute a valid cause of action. It should be said at the outset that, in this respect, it was conceded that the plaintiffmight be able to formulate a claim which would be sustainable, at any rate, on the pleadings. In relation to the cross-appeal, however,it is said that the plaintiff's claim is fundamentally bad because, in effect, it is a claim on behalf of the creditors and thata claim on behalf of the creditors should not lie against auditors.</p>    <p class="heading">The major averments in the statement of claim</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> For the purposes of the present proceedings, it is, of course, necessary to take the allegations made in the statement of claim asbeing factually correct. The following facts emerge from the statement of claim. The plaintiff is a company which was placed intocreditors' voluntary liquidation on 12 October 1998 by a resolution of the directors who had formed the opinion that the companycould not, by reason of its liabilities, continue its business. The defendant firm was appointed the auditors of the plaintiff forthe years ending 31 December 1994 to 31 December 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff's audited accounts for the years since its incorporation form schedules to the statement of claim. Those accounts,as well as paragraph 94 of the statement of claim, reveal that, at all times, the ultimate holding company of the plaintiff was GuangdongInternational Trust and Investment Corporation ("GITIC"). In January 1999, GITIC was itself declared bankrupt according to the lawsof the Mainland. Nothing further is alleged about the relationship between the plaintiff and GITIC other than the fact that GITIChad provided a letter of indemnity whereby it agreed to indemnify the plaintiff against various losses. Those losses did not includethe alleged losses that are the subject matter of the complaints in respect of which the plaintiff now wishes to pursue this action.There are three categories of transactions in respect of which the plaintiff now wishes to continue the action. These may be referredto as the Wantong, the Life Circle and the Standard Corporation transactions.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>The Wantong transactions</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It is alleged, in paragraphs 29, 30(a), 31 to 33 of the statement of claim, that letters of credit were opened by the plaintiff infavour of "suppliers", purportedly for the supply of steel pipes and other goods which would be on sold to Wantong Steel Pipe Co.Ltd. It is not clear whether there was more than 1 supplier, but all the transactions in 1994 were said to have been with Kwong Wah.What is said is that no goods were purchased and, instead, these were fictitious transactions whereby money was obtained by the supplierfrom the banks on the basis of forged documents. The supplier would, at some stage, repay the plaintiff the monies that had beenreceived from the relevant bank and that fact confirmed that there were no genuine sales. The transactions were entered into theplaintiff's accounts as part of the gross invoiced sales, which, evidently, they were not. It is pleaded that the sums in respectof the letters of credit transactions should not have been included in the turnover figure. It is alleged that there was a closeconnection between Kwong Wah and the plaintiff in that two of the directors of that company had been in the plaintiff's employ and,indeed, one of those directors, who is said to have been the chief signatory of the applications for the letters of credit on behalfof the plaintiff, was the accounts manager of the plaintiff until 1998. Furthermore, one of the vice-chairmen of Wantong had, atone stage, been a director of the plaintiff and the other had been a manager of the plaintiff until 1995.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>Life Circle transactions</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In respect of the Life Circle transactions, it is alleged in paragraphs 34 to 36 of the statement of claim that letters of creditwere opened in favour of two suppliers, Kam Kiu International Limited ("Kam Kiu") and Southern Plywood Industry Sdn Bhd, for thesupply of Malaysian plywood. Again, it is said that no goods were obtained and there was no onward sale of any goods to Life Circle.The monies which were received from the banks by both Southern Plywood and Kam Kiu were repaid by Kam Kiu. Unlike the Wantong transactions,in this case the transactions appeared in the plaintiff's accounts as interest and commission which were said to have been received;they were not treated in the accounts as sales, as such. It is said that the documents which purported to evidence the sale transactionswere signed by two directors of the plaintiffs, a Mr Ye Qing Lin and Huang Qing Zhou and three of the plaintiff's managers namely,Geng Guang Li, Wong Yin and Chung Fuk Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The transactions in relation to Wantong and Life Circle were alleged to have been continued in the periods to which the 1995 and1996 accounts related.</p>    <p class="heading">The Standard Corporation transaction</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The allegation in respect of Standard Corporation is that in the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 the plaintiff made new advances in respectof what were termed "major projects" in relation to "Standard Corporation". In paragraph 172 of the statement of claim it is saidthat the 1996 accounts included $41.7 million in respect of a new investment in Standard Corporation and then in paragraph 173(b),it is said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"because the vendor was Kam Kiu: had the true nature of the transactions involving Kam Kiu (i.e. the transactions relating to GTL[Gain Talent Development Ltd., a wholly owed subsidiary of the plaintiff] and Life Circle) been revealed as a result of the defendant'saudit of the 1994 and 1995 accounts, no transaction involving Kam Kiu would have taken place thereafter. The sale and purchase agreementwhich Standard Corporation entered into with Kam Kiu was entered into on the 6th December 1996 which was after KWTF [the defendant]had reported on the 1995 accounts."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> It might be mentioned at this stage that the written submissions on behalf of the plaintiff go further than the allegations in thestatement of claim. They refer to the fact that Standard Corporation, being a subsidiary of the plaintiff, would not have purchaseda building from Kam Kiu had the matters referred to in paragraph 173(b) been revealed.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>The auditors' duties</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The statement of claim sets out both the statutory duties of the auditors as well as the common law duties of care, which arise asa result of the relationship between an auditor and the client. It also sets out some of the statements of standard accounting practice,which governed the manner in which audits should have been conducted and accounts prepared. For present purposes, nothing arisesout of this. Furthermore, no question arises, on this application, on the allegation that the defendant was in breach of duties,both under contract and the common law, because of the manner in which the accounts were presented in relation, at least, to theWantong and Life Circle transactions. It should be noted that the complaint is that instead of drawing the various irregularitiesto attention in the auditors' reports and in the accounts, the defendant reported that the financial statements gave a true and fairview in all material respects of the plaintiff's affairs.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>Causation and Loss</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The material plea that the plaintiff now relies upon in respect of the Wantong and Life Circle transactions is contained in paragraph107 of the statement of claim. The part specifically relied upon reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Had the true position in respect of the Wantong and Life Circle letter of credit transactions been revealed, then these false transactionswould have come to an end."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is alleged that at the date of the liquidation the balance outstanding as a result of these transactions was $551 million and thatat least $264.5 million of this loss would have been avoided. In relation to Standard Corporation, as already noted, it is allegedthat the plaintiff would not have made any investments that would have involved Mr Lam or Kam Kiu.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> For completeness, it should be mentioned that the statement of claim as originally drafted had included other claims in respect ofwhich the judge had used the term "trading loss claims". Those amounted to allegations that if the true state of the plaintiff'sfinances had been revealed, the plaintiff would have ceased trading and therefore not made losses in subsequent years. That pleawas held by the deputy judge to be a bad plea on the basis of established authority. There was no appeal against that holding, exceptin relation to the Standard Corporation transaction, and, therefore, no more need be said about that, save that it took up a considerableamount of the statement of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">The decision below in respect of the Wantong and Life Circle claims</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The deputy judge below considered the claim in respect of the Wantong and Life Circle transactions under the heading of the "salesloss claims". He considered that such a claim against auditors would be based on their failure to uncover misfeasance by the managementin misapplying assets of the company. He termed this a "defalcation claim". At paragraph 91 of the judgment, he considered that thefictitious transactions of the trading loss claims should be treated as defalcation claims. In paragraph 99 of the judgment, thedeputy judge expressed the view that the plaintiff would have a viable claim if it were to plead (a) credible facts which go to showthat the "sales" were a fraud on the plaintiff and (b) that the board of directors was misled and (c) that the plaintiff by its directorsor shareholders relied on the negligent audit in failing to stop the fraud which led to losses.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On this appeal Mr ter Haar QC, on behalf of the plaintiff, took issue, first of all, with the suggestion that the plaintiff's claimis dependent upon an allegation of fraud on the plaintiff. Whilst he readily admits that, on the basis of the allegations at presentin the statement of claim, there are grounds for alleging that fraud had been committed on the banks by the submission of bogus salesdocuments, he avers that it is sufficient to found a cause of action that there should have been irregularities to which the auditorsshould have drawn attention by their audit report. In respect of the argument that the matter of causation had not been adequatelypleaded, Mr ter Haar again averred that the pleading was sufficient. He pointed out that the allegations in the statement of claimin relation to the Wantong and Life Circle transactions follow closely the Precedent Form 9P/3 in Jackson and Powell, <em>Professional Liability Precedents October 2000</em>. It is said that in the light of that, the allegations are complete and, although further and better particulars may be provided,the pleading, as a pleading, is sufficient.</p>    <p class="heading">Ingredients of claims against auditors</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In order to consider whether the statement of claim is sufficient, as it stands at present, it would be convenient to highlight whatwould be necessary in a pleading for a claim for damages to be made against an auditor. In my view the essential headings can besummarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the duty, which may arise either by reason of statute, contract or the common duty of care</p>        <p>(b) the fact that the relevant duty was owed to the plaintiff</p>        <p>(c) a breach of the relevant duty</p>        <p>(d) damage suffered as a result of the breach and</p>        <p>(e) loss flowing from the damage which has been suffered.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The pleading in the present case</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The essence of the pleading in relation to the present case has already been summarised. The statutory, contractual and common lawduties of care have been fully pleaded and no issue has been taken in respect thereof. It has also been pleaded that those dutieswere owed to the plaintiff. Some minor distraction was raised in the present proceedings by a suggestion that the auditors' dutieswere duties owed to the shareholders as opposed to the company. Reliance was made, in particular, on passages in the speeches in<strong>Caparo Industries Plc v. Dickman</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 A.C. 605.</a> They go to show the underlying philosophy behind the requirement for audited accounts and the reasons why it is the shareholdersin general meeting, rather than the directors, who appoint the auditors. That, however, does not detract from the fact that the auditors'contractual duty is owed to the company which appoints them and the common law duty of care and the statutory duties are owed tothe company.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The <strong>Caparo</strong> case was concerned with a claim by a company which had taken over the company in respect of which the relevant defendants had beenthe auditors. The claim was, therefore, a claim in tort and not a claim in contract. Furthermore it was not a claim by a shareholderbut was treated as a claim by an outsider. The case was not concerned with whether the company, which had had its accounts audited,had a claim against the auditors but was concerned with whether an outsider would have a claim against the auditors. The questionof liability of the auditors was tried as a preliminary issue. The House of Lords held that no duty of care was owed to a potentialinvestor in the company, since, in this respect, it was a non-shareholder. It is evident from passages in the speeches of Lord Bridgeand Lord Oliver that it was understood that the company itself might have had a claim. At page 626D-E Lord Bridge made referenceto shareholders losses being recouped in an action by the company and not by the shareholders. At page 630 F-G Lord Oliver said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is the auditors' function to ensure, so far as possible, that the financial information as to the company's affairs prepared bythe directors accurately reflects the company's position in order, <em>first, to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing</em> (by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capital) and, secondly, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for thepurpose of enabling them to scrutinise the conduct of the company's affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward orcontrol or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Since this action is concerned with an action by the company and not an action by the shareholders, it is unnecessary to considerthe duties owed to shareholders. It is sufficient to say that the duties are owed to the plaintiff. In relation to the breach ofduty, again, there is no live dispute, for the present purposes, as to the sufficiency of the allegation of breach of duty. The realquestion comes as to whether there is a sufficient causal link between the breach of duty and any loss alleged by the plaintiff tohave been consequent upon that breach of duty.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> At times during the hearing, questions were raised as to whether the damage had been sufficiently identified in the pleading, butin my view it must be taken to have been so identified in respect of the Wantong and Life Circle transactions to the extent thatthe losses have been pleaded. For a successful claim to be made these losses would have to be pleaded as unrecovered losses but that,in the context, would be a minor addition, which, in the course of argument, was, for practical purposes, taken as read.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr ter Haar relies on two further sets of averments that he says should be taken as being incorporated in the pleadings. The firstwas contained in a letter of 19 April 2002 that was sent in response to a letter from the defendant's solicitors shortly prior tothe hearing in the court below. The material part of that letter reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... neither the questionable nature of the transactions of which complaint is made in the Statement of Claim, nor the fact that therewas a deficiency in assets of the Company, were known to the majority of directors of the company, nor for that matter to the majorityof the directors of its parent, GITIC."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In addition, on the final day of the hearing in the court below, there was submitted to the court an additional paragraph to be insertedas paragraph 104A. For present purposes the material parts of that read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2. The plaintiff's case is that with the exception of Huang Qing Zhou, a director of the plaintiff but not a director of GITIC, thedirectors of the plaintiff and the directors of its shareholder, GITIC, were unaware of the errors in the Plaintiff's statement ofassets, the Plaintiff's true financial condition and the fictitious transactions referred to above. A further director of the Plaintiffand GITIC, and Ye Qing Lin, knew the letter of credit transactions but, so far as the plaintiff is aware, he did not know that theywere fictitious.</p>        <p class="quote">3. Had the matters pleaded above been drawn to their attention, the directors of the Plaintiff and/or the directors of GITIC:-"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>would have, in effect, prevented the plaintiff from carrying out the transactions which caused the loss.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> It is pertinent to emphasise, in this respect, that it is not alleged that the plaintiff did not know the matters which it is allegedthe defendant's audit should have revealed. In this way, if not others, the pleading still materially differs from the precedentin <em>Jackson and Powell</em> to which reference has already been made. There are, perhaps, good reasons in this case for the plaintiff not wanting to put itscase on that basis. Knowledge of Mr Huang, and possibly Mr Ye, if not some of the managers, may well be attributed to the plaintiff.In this context it may be observed that very little is pleaded as to the internal workings of the plaintiff and as to the variousresponsibilities of the different parties. The argument on behalf of the plaintiff was put on the basis, that even if such knowledgemight be attributed to the plaintiff, either as a matter of fact or as a matter of law, it was still open to the plaintiff to averthat, should the majority of directors, either of the plaintiff or of its ultimate parent, GITIC, have become aware of the transactions,they would have taken steps to stop any continuation. The argument was that public revelation might have been enough to have promptedthe relevant directors into action even if they had prior knowledge of the "irregularities".</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> It seems to me that a pleading along those lines might be viable save for one matter. It would it seems to me be necessary for thepleading to contain particulars as to precisely who would have taken what steps had the matters, which were alleged to have beendeficient in the auditors' report and accounts, been revealed. In this respect the precedent in <em>Jackson and Powell</em> is relevant. The precedent to which Mr ter Haar made particular reference related to a situation where the managing director of acompany had committed a fraud on the company and the sample pleading contained the averment that the company was ignorant of thefacts. In those circumstances it is easily understandable that a logical connection may be made between the company, which was previouslyunaware that a fraud was being committed against it, becoming aware of the fraud and taking steps to recover in respect of it andto prevent repetition.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> On the other hand a company that knew irregularities were taking place, seems to me to be in a different position. In such circumstancesit is by no means clear that, even if the auditors were to draw attention to the irregularities, the company would take any stepsto prevent the continuation of those irregularities, because the company had known about them and would, without more, be presumedto have approved of its own conduct. In my view, the logical conclusion that a company would take immediate steps in respect of ahitherto unknown fraud does not apply in a situation where a company itself knows that it is committing "irregularities" and thematter happens to be spelt out in the accounts. This is particularly so in the case of a private company, because the accounts arenot generally published. Since the matter has now reached the stage where the plaintiff will have to amend its pleading in orderto save it, there is no doubt in my mind that those particulars should be provided as part of any amendment, if indeed this is theplaintiff's case.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> In relation to the lack of knowledge on the part of the directors of GITIC, I consider that there is at present a deficiency in thepleading as to what control it is alleged was and would have been exercised by those persons in respect of the plaintiff. It is tobe noted that the audited accounts revealed GITIC to have been the ultimate holding company, whereas sub-paragraph 2 of the proposedparagraph 104A refers to GITIC being a shareholder of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> To conclude, the deputy judge was right to strike out the statement of claim as it stood as far as the Wantong and Life Circle claimswere concerned. I should also add that, particularly in cases of professional negligence, particular care needs to be given to thepleading of causation. As is put at paragraph 75-05 of <em>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings</em> (14th ed.) Vol. 2, "Causation of loss often involves more complex issues in a professional negligence case than in an ordinary negligenceclaim, making it generally necessary to set out the material parts relied upon as correcting the negligence to the damage suffered."</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>Standard Corporation</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> As regards the Standard Corporation claim, the matter is somewhat different. The plaintiff has sought, in argument, to put the matteron the basis that Standard Corporation, which was a subsidiary of the plaintiff, would not have entered into a contract to purchasea building from Kam Kiu in 1996 had it been aware of the true nature of the transactions with which Mr Lau and Kam Kiu were involved.I have to say, however, that the manner in which the matter is at present pleaded is wholly unacceptable. Even putting together whatfacts might be gleaned from paragraph 101(b) and what remains of paragraphs 172 and 173, I find there is no comprehensible allegationof a specific transaction which was entered into as a result of a specified defect in the auditors' report or accounts by reasonof which the plaintiff suffered loss, which would otherwise have been avoided. In short the pleading is by no means clear enoughto disclose a cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Whether or not the plaintiff is in a position to plead a cause of action based on the Standard Corporation transaction is by no meanscertain. The allegation, as far as can be gleaned from the statement of claim and the skeleton arguments, involved Standard Corporation,as a subsidiary of the plaintiff, purchasing a building from Kam Kiu. If that impression be wrong, the error highlights the defectsin the present pleading. But why it should be that the purchase of a building, in itself, caused loss is by no means clear. The factthat a building in Hong Kong contracted to be purchased on 6 December 1996 may be worth far less now, according to present day values,than it was then is no indication that a loss has been suffered that could be attributed to anything other than a fall in marketvalue. In any event, it seems to me that, if a claim on this basis is to be made, the facts giving rise to the claim must be pleadedin a concise, precise and comprehensible manner. It would not be acceptable to have to wade through scattered paragraphs in the hopeof gleaning facts from which some cause of action might be arrived at. Still less is it acceptable to have to ferret out some basisfor a claim from many years' audited accounts.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I am of the view that this part of the statement of claim should be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading">The remoteness-policy argument</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Under the subheading 'Remoteness', the deputy judge came to the conclusion, in relation to what he categorised as the trading lossclaims, that the auditor's liability would be limited "to the value of the shares held by the shareholders at the time of the negligentaudit" see paragraph 75. He did so on the basis of the proposition that, because it was the plaintiff's case that it was hopelesslyinsolvent in 1994, any recovery in this action would be for the benefit of the creditors and not for either the shareholders or theplaintiff itself.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Whereas this argument was put forward on the basis of policy, the deputy judge dealt with it as a question of remoteness. When thedeputy judge came to what he referred to as the sales loss claims, in other words the Wantong and Life Circle claims, he appearsto have considered the argument inapplicable. As part of the appeal, the plaintiff contends that the argument is totally inapplicable.By a respondent's notice the defendant contend that the matter is one of policy and is equally applicable to the sales loss claimsas well as the trading loss claims.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Mr Pollock QC, on behalf of the defendant, did not shrink from the fact that this is a new point that has never been the subjectof a decision in a relevant court before. The argument is founded, in part, upon observations made by Lord Hoffmann towards the endof a speech which he made to the Chancery Bar Association in London in June 1999. The theme of Lord Hoffmann's speech was that courtshave frequently used expressions such as "It is a matter of common sense ..." to justify a conclusion without giving adequate considerationto the underlying principle. At page 22 of the printed version of the speech, Lord Hoffmann gave an example of a company in insolventliquidation suing its auditors for negligence in auditing its statutory accounts. In that case, the claim against the auditors hadbeen made on the basis that because of a failure to reveal fraud, the company had continued trading and had thereby increased thelosses. The claim was made in respect of the increase in the losses which had occurred after the faulty audit of the accounts. Thematter had been disposed of as a matter of causation. On page 23 of the speech Lord Hoffmann suggested that the matter could havebeen covered by the scope of the duty owed by the auditors. It was pointed out that any recovery would have been solely for the benefitof the creditors and hence the claim was, in effect, a claim for their benefit. Since no duty was owed to the creditors, the policyshould be that recovery should not be allowed.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Put in that way, the argument has some attraction. Nevertheless, the shifting way this proposition, which was said to be based onpolicy, was put on behalf of the defendant in the course of argument, alone demonstrated that the effect of any such policy had notbeen fully considered. It was certainly not clear enough to constitute a ground for striking out the statement of claim. It shouldbe pointed out that, in the present case, the claim is not simply a claim in tort, it is a claim in contract. It is, furthermore,not a claim on behalf of the shareholders. It is a claim by the company and, in particular, a contractual claim.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> A company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. If it has a contractual claim it is entitled, at least, to nominal damagesfor any breach. As was pointed out in argument on behalf of the plaintiff, it is difficult to discern a policy reason which wouldexclude recovery for loss occasioned by a breach of contract. In the course of argument, the difficulties which would arise by reasonof having to discern whether a claim by the company would be disallowed on the basis of insolvency would depend upon the clarityof the situation which gave rise to the insolvency.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The notion that policy considerations should deny relief in respect of particular claims that would otherwise be viable is somethingthat would need careful and detailed consideration before so far-reaching a proposition could be upheld. The application of a policywhich would be limited solely to claims against auditors is something which would need rational deliberation. It may well be thatpolicy considerations might lead to the conclusion that in cases involving corporate misfeasance where a number of different partieswere responsible for the particular misfeasance, for example, directors, auditors, legal advisors or whoever, liability should beapportioned in the first instance and recovery should only be possible to the extent of that party's proportional liability. Suchpolicy considerations have led to a change in the law in other jurisdictions, such as New South Wales, but it would be for the legislatureto introduce such a change in the law.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I am therefore of the view that the sales loss claims cannot be struck out on this ground alone.</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal against decision of 18 June 2002</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In the further decision of 12 July 2002, the deputy judge said at paragraph 3:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If I may say so, from the skeleton of counsel representing the Plaintiff, there are some, I should say, powerful arguments as towhy I should exercise my discretion staying my order of 18 June 2002. However, I regret to say that those arguments were not putbefore me when I last heard the parties on 18 June."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The deputy judge then went on to hold that he was powerless to rectify the situation because he considered that the action had alreadybeen dismissed. Whereas this appeal is not against the order of 12 July, it should be pointed out that the court has a considerabledegree of flexibility in procedural matters, both as to the exercise of the powers to extend time after expiry of time and otherwise.If a court considers the justice of a situation requires the exercise of that flexibility it should not be put off simply becausea formal application has been made in what might be technically regarded as the wrong form or because some further order should havebeen sought in a summons.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Be that as it may, in upholding the decision of the deputy judge below that the statement of claim in its present form does not disclosea valid cause of action, the reasoning of the deputy judge has not been followed in its entirety, in particular that in relationto defalcation. Therefore the circumstances under which the deputy judge exercised his discretion are not the relevant circumstanceswhich this court has now held should apply. There is, furthermore, considerable force in the argument on behalf of the plaintiffthat to force the plaintiff to produce amendments based upon the judgment of 21 May 2002 was to compel the plaintiff to plead thecase in a way which it did not wish to do; and in a way which it might not have been able to do and, in my judgment, was not thereforenecessary. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the Standard Corporation claim might be revived.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I would therefore dismiss the appeal against the first judgment and order (CACV 263/2002). In view of the possible viability of theplaintiff's claim, I would allow the second appeal by the plaintiff (CACV 292/2002) and substitute an order that the plaintiff shouldhave 21 days from the handing down of this judgment in which to make an application to amend the statement of claim. Since in CACV263 of 2002 the plaintiff has failed to secure the reversal of the order of the judge below but has, nevertheless, succeeded in thearguments relating to defalcation and remoteness, there should be no order as to costs in respect of that appeal. The plaintiff shouldbe entitled to the costs of the appeal in CACV 292 of 2002. I would therefore make an order for costs accordingly. I would not alterthe orders as to costs below.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Le Pichon JA:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Ma JA:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Rogers VP:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> There will therefore be orders as per paragraph 39 above.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Geoffrey Ma)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Roger ter Haar QC and Mr Godfrey Lam, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the Plaintiff/Appellant</p>        <p>Mr Gordon Pollock QC, Mr Charles Sussex SC and Mr Jonathan Harris, instructed by Messrs Linklaters, for the Defendant/Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->            <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2003/320.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
