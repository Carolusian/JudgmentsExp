Worldwide TechnicalServices Company Inc. of Houston, Texas shipped 43 packages of oil well drilling rig equipment on the "Happy Pioneer" to the plaintiffsin Peking via the port of Tientsin, The vessel did not take the goods to Tientsin.

He submitted that the defendants had thereby repudiated the contract of carriageand that they could not now say to the plaintiffs that, although they had repudiated, the plaintiffs were still bound by the jurisdictionclause in the Bill of Lading. It was common ground that a deviation is a fundamental breach of contract and that it would, unlessaccepted by the cargo owner, bring the whole contract to an end. Mr. Tong, while conceding that there was a dispute as to whetheror not a deviation had taken place, submitted that the effect of a stay would be that the Court would be holding that the plaintiffswere bound by a contract which may have been repudiated by the defendants. Initially Mr. Tong seemed to be treating this first contentionas a separate and fundamental point which, of itself, would be sufficient to deprive the defendants of the right to a stay. Howeveras his argument developed, it became clear that what he was really saying was that once the issue as to whether the contract hadbeen discharged by the fault of the defendants had been properly raised, then it was a matter which the Court should take into accountwhen it turned to deal with the considerations set out in the ''<u>Eleftheria</u>"<sup>(1)</sup> at 237. Mr. Tong submitted that this consideration, when squarely raised, would be of substantial, if not conclusive, weight againstthe granting of a stay. I will deal further with this contention when I come to deal with the "Eleftheria" considerations.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Tong's second point was that the plaintiff had a separate and distinct cause of action in tort. He submitted that this was sobecause Clause 3 of the Bill of Lading only covered "actions" under the "contract of carriage", which did not include actions intort. In such circumstances, he submitted, it would be wrong to force the plaintiff to bring its action in contract in Holland whileit was, quite properly, pursuing its action in tort in Hong Kong. Mr. Tong submitted that cases such as <u>Woolf</u> v. <u>Collis</u> <u>Removal Service</u><sup>(2)</sup>, which was cited by Mr. Ribeiro who appeared for the defendants, which held that an arbitration clause survives the acceptance ofa breach as a repudiation had no application at the present case. I find myself in agreement with this submission and I do not considerthat any real assistance can be gained from the cases dealing with arbitration clauses. I am satisfied that a jurisdiction clausedoes not stand on the same footing as an arbitration clause. A case upon which Mr. Ribeiro heavily relied was the <u>"Makefjell"</u><sup>(3)</sup>. In that case there was a Bill of Lading containing a jurisdiction clause which read as follows:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"any claim against the carrier arising under this Bill of Lading shall be decided at the principal place of business of the carrier."(which was in Norway) .</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">It was contended that the words "claim .... arising under this Bill of Lading" did not include claims framed in tort for damage togoods that had been carried. Lord Justice Cairns said at 33:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"I do not think there can be any doubt that the parties intended that any claims in respect of damage to the goods carried under theBills of Lading should be decided in Oslo and according to Norwegian law, however they were Framed. To a business man it would beabsurd to suppose that if one cause of action was pleaded it should be triable in Norway according to Norwegian law, whereas if anothercause of action was pleaded it might be triable anywhere where one of the owners' ships might be arrested and possibly accordingto a different system of law; and that if cargo owners wished to pursue both causes of caution they could pursue them in two differentCourts and according to two different legal codes. Giving a commonsense meaning to the words of the clause, I am satisfied that theyapply to the claim in tort as well as to the claim in contract."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">I must say, with respect, that this robust appeal to commonsense finds favour with me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Tong sought to rely upon the unreported case of the "<u>Shin Shien</u>", Admiralty Jurisdiction 1979 Folio No. 9 in which Mr. Justice Cons held that the jurisdiction clause with which he was dealing wasnot sufficiently wide to cover claims in tort. That clause was very differently worded From the one in the present case which, Iam satisfied, is, for all practical purposes, the same as that which was being dealt with in the <u>Makefjell</u> <sup>(3)</sup>. I respectfully adopt the approach of Lord Justice Cairns and having done so I am satisfied that the jurisdiction clause is wideenough to cover actions in tort.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Tong's next point was, what was referred to in argument as, the COGSA point. This point, depending upon the way in which it isdecided, may again have to be canvassed when the <u>Eleftheria</u><sup>(1)</sup> considerations are being dealt with. Mr. Tong argued, and this was common ground, that it was for this Court to decide the properlaw of the contract. He said that once this Court had decided which law was applicable then it would apply that law to the contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> He submitted that an examination of the clauses of the Bill of Lading would show that United States law was a proper law of a contractand that, this having been established, it inevitably followed either that the whole agreement was null and void or that clause 2thereof, which made the law of the Netherlands the proper law of the contract, was null and void.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Tong sought to demonstrate that this was so in the following way. Firstly he submitted that, when deciding which systems of lawwas applicable, the Court had to look at the whole of the contract and the circumstances in which it was made. He pointed to theconnections which the contract had with the United States and in this regard, particularly relied upon Additional Clause (F). Whileit is true that it could be demonstrated that the contract was connected in a number of ways with United States, I do not considerthat, leaving aside additional clause F, these were of sufficient weight to determine the proper law of the contract. Mr. Tong, inmy view, could only be successful on this ground if he could persuade me to accept his view of the meaning and effect of AdditionalClause F. Mr. Tong submitted that it was clear, by virtue of Additional Clause F, that the United States Carriage of Goods by SeaAct (COGSA) applied to the Bill of Lading.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> He submitted further that not only did COGSA take effect by virtue of Additional Clause (F) in the Hill of Lading but that it alsotook effect because of the declaration to that effect in the Act itself which states in its preamble "that every Bill of Lading ....which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the United States, in foreign trade, shall haveeffect subject to the provisions of this Act." In this regard Mr. Tong sought to invoke the principle emunciated in the <u>Morviken</u><sup>(4)</sup> which held that as the Hague - Visby Rules have, by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971, been given the force of law in Englandthat, whenever there is any inconsistency between the terms of a Bill of Lading and those Rules, the Rules will prevail. Mr. Tongsubmitted that this same approach should be taken to the inconsistency between COGSA and the present Bill of Lading.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Ribeiro submitted that the COGSA was not in the same footing as the Hague - Visby Rules, as it was not the law in Hong Kong andthat it could not be treated as such.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I cannot accept Mr. Tong's submission as to the effect of the statement in the preamble to the American Act. Its result, if it wasaccepted, would be that an American statute would be given the force of law in the Courts of this Colony. I accept that the partiescan themselves incorporate a foreign act or part thereof into an agreement and that they have done so in this case. I do not accedeto the submission that, a statement in a foreign statute can, as a matter of law, bind the Hong Kong Court to regard that statuteas the he governing law of the contract. Mr. Tong submitted that he was not really inhibited in his argument by the Court so holdingas the parties had by their own act made American law the proper law of the contract.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> He submitted that s. 3(5) of COGSA therefore applied to the contract. This section reads as follows:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damageto or in connection with the goods, arising from negligence, fault or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section,or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this Act, shall be null and void and of no effect."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> COGSA, in s. 4(5), applies a US$500 per package damage liability limitation and; at today's rate of exchange, this amount is greaterthan the maximum damage liability per package of D.f1. $1,250 stipulated in clause 2 of the Hill of Lading. This being so, Mr. Tongargued that Section 3(8) either makes the "agreement", i.e. Bill of Lading, null and void and of no effect or, at the very least,makes Clause 2 of the Bill of Lading, null and void and of no effect. Mr. Tong submitted that if the whole agreement was null andvoid, then the plaintiffs were entitled to sue for damages in tort in any jurisdiction. He said that, alternatively, if only Clause2 was null and void, then the law of application was United States law and that the Court should take this  into account when dealingwith consideration (b) of the <u>Eleftheria</u><sup>(1)</sup> considerations.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Tongs first approach is a bold one. He argues that the parties have, by their own stipulation, declared their contract to be"null and void". A Court would surely hesitate long before allowing itself to be driven to this conclusion. Clearly the parties enteredinto the contract intending it to have effect and to govern their relations. The Court is being asked to hold that, by what appearsto have been an inadvertent stroke, they have wholly nullified that intention. I am satisfied that it would be quite wrong to holdthat they have done so and that, at best for Mr. Tong, the effect of Additional Clause (F)would be no more than that it nullifiedClause 2. Does it have even that effect?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr. Ribeiro acknowledged that Additional Clause (F) made reference to COGSA but he submitted that the clause did net, when read inthe context of the Bill of Lading, bring American law into play as the proper law of the contract. He submitted that Clause 2 wasthe controlling clause and that only the clearest indication could override such a precisely worded express choice of law clause.He argued that Additional Clause (F) stated only that -</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"....... the provisions stated in the said Act shall govern before loading and after discharge and throughout the entire time thegoods are in the carriers' custody."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">He submitted that the clause did not bring in American law as a proper law of the contract, but simply incorporated the relevant provisionsof COGSA into the governing law of the contract which, by virtue of Clause 2, was the law of the Netherlands.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> He pointed out that the final sentence in Additional Clause (F), giving the carrier the benefit of certain sections of the revisedstatutes of the United States, would not be necessary at all if the clause had already made United States law the proper law of thecontract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He pointed to the final sentence of Clause 2 which provides: "This Bill of Lading is subject to the compulsory provisions of lawunder which the carriage falls, it being understood that if any stipulation of this Bill off Lading is wholly or partly contraryhereto (sic), this Bill of lading shall be read as if such stipulation or part thereof, as the case may be, were deleted." He submittedthat, when the relevant provisions of COGSA were incorporated, there would no longer be any conflict as the American provision asto limitation would apply as provided by the final sentence of Clause 2. I am satisfied as to the correctness of this argument. Iam satisfied that Additional Clause (F) incorporates the relevant provisions of the United States Carriage of Goods Act into theBill of Lading and that it in no way affects the fundamental agreement of the parties which was that the law of the Netherlands wouldbe the law of application.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In case I should be wrong in so holding, I will, when dealing with the Eleftheria consideration, which I turn to next, indicate theeffect which the deletion of clause 2 would, in my view, have on consideration (b).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Finally Mr. Tong submitted that, even if the Court was against him on his first two points, he had shown strong cause against anorder staying the proceedings. In this regard the Court must consider the whole of the circumstances and must in particular turnits mind to the considerations which were set out in the Eleftheria <sup>(1)</sup> as follows:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="86%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">                <p align="left">(a)</p>            </td>            <td width="83%" colspan="3" valign="top">                <p align="left">In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relativeconvenience and expense of trial as between Hong Kong and foreign courts.</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">                <p align="left">(b)</p>            </td>            <td width="83%" colspan="3" valign="top">                <p align="left">Whether the law of the foreign Court applies and, if so, whether it differs from English law in any material respects.</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">                <p align="left">(c)</p>            </td>            <td width="83%" colspan="3" valign="top">                <p align="left">With what country either party is connected, and how closely.</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">                <p align="left">(d)</p>            </td>            <td width="83%" colspan="3" valign="top">                <p align="left">Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages.</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">                <p align="left">(e)</p>            </td>            <td width="83%" colspan="3" valign="top">                <p align="left">Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign Court because they would</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                <p style="text-align:right">(i)</p>            </td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="75%" valign="top">                <p align="left">be deprived of security for that claim;</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                <p style="text-align:right">(ii)</p>            </td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="75%" valign="top">                <p align="left">be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                <p align="left">(iii)</p>            </td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="75%" valign="top">                <p align="left">be faced with a time-bar not applicable in England; or</p>                <p align="left"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">                <p align="left">(iv)</p>            </td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="75%" valign="top">                <p align="left">for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">                (a) As to expense and convenience, Mr. Tong submitted that the evidence of damage would be in Hong Kong and that therewas a possibility that witnesses might have to be flown from Hong Kong to Amsterdam if the trial was to take place there. This istrue, however, it is very possible that this aspect of the matter will be dealt with purely by affidavit with the relevant documentsexhibited thereto. Mr. Tong submitted that as far as the port control officials at Tientsin were concerned, it would certainly beless costly and more convenient to bring them to Hong Kong than to take them to Amsterdam. As far as the defence witnesses are concerned,he submitted that they might, at any time, be anywhere in the world, and that bringing them to Hong Kong would be no more expensiveor inconvenient than taking them to Amsterdam. As far as the port control officials are concerned, it seems clear that it would beless expensive and more convenient if the trial were held in Hong Kong. On the ether hand, given the speed and availability of moderntransport, there would be no great inconvenience in getting them to Amsterdam.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> As to (b), I am satisfied, as I have indicated, that the law of the Netherlands is the proper law of the contract and this wouldclearly be best applied by the Court at Amsterdam. However, I bear in mind, in this regard, that it has not been suggested that thereare any differences between Dutch and Hong Kong law and that, unless this was shown to be so, a Hong Kong Court would proceed uponthe basis that the two systems of law were the same, and no difficulty should, therefore, arise in this regard if the trial wereto be held in Hong Kong. If, contrary to what I have held, American law applies, there is nothing to choose between Amsterdam andHong Kong. The foreign law point, being neutral, would then be of no assistance to the plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> As to (c), Mr. Tong submitted that comparatively speaking, both parties were connected with Hang Kong and that only one had any connectionwith Holland. I find myself unable to agree with this contention. The plaintiffs are a Pelting based company. It has an agent inHong Kong, namely Yick Ho Ltd., through whom, it appears, it operates when necessary. It is true that the defendant company alsohas an agent in Hong Kong, however the parent company, which owns the defendant, is clearly based in Holland. I do not consider thateither company has any significant connection with Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> No submissions were made as to consideration (d) and I, therefore, pass to consideration (e). The only argument addressed in thisregard was as to consideration (e)(iv). It was submitted that, as the Netherlands and China de not have diplomatic relations, theChinese might feel that they would be subjected to some form of racial discrimination if forced to litigate in Amsterdam. Mr. Tongwas unable to point to any fact that would establish, in a concrete way, that this would be happen but he submitted that the Chinesemight feel that it would, and that it was important that justice be seen to be done. There was no real basis shown from which itcould be inferred that there might be discrimination. In such circumstances, I consider it would be improper For me to entertainthis submission resting as it did upon the suggestion that there was some doubt as to the impartiality of the Courts of the Netherlands.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Finally Mr. Tong suggested that his clients would be put at some sort of disadvantage as the Courts of the Netherlands use the inquisitorialrather than the adversarial system. I had thought that arguments such as this were laid to rest by the decision in the <u>El Amria</u><sup>(5)</sup>. In rejecting this submission I can only refer once again to the words of Lord Justice Brandon at 127 where he said:-</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left" class="quote">"It follows from what I have said that I think that the learned judge should not have allowed himself to be drawn into making comparisonsbetween the two different systems of administering justice used by English Courts on the one hand and Egyptian Courts on the other;and should still less have allowed himself to be persuaded to express the view which he did that, the purposes of this case, thesystem of the English Courts was likely to lead to a fuller and more thorough investigation of the dispute between the parties thanthe system of the Egyptian Courts."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In all of the circumstances, I do not consider that the plaintiffs have proved strong cause for refusal of the granting of a stay.The action will, therefore, be ordered to be stayed in Hong Kong. The plaintiffs were ordered to pay the defendants' costs to betaxed.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(N.
