At thecommencement of the trial before me, I had sounded out the views of both Counsel as to whether they would prefer the claim to betransferred back to the Labour Tribunal or be heard by me, having given my personal views then that it would appear to be in theinterest of the parties to have it dealt with here since they had gone so far and in order to save further time and expenses. BothCounsel agreed that I ought to do it and I did it. As the Rules of Evidence do not apply to the Labour Tribunal, the fortune of theparties might have been different had it been dealt with there. It is therefore necessary for me to make the following observation.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, a presiding officer has very wide power to transfer a claim to another court for <u>any</u> reason as he thinks fit. The learned Presiding Officer chose to give his reasons for transfer. As I see it, all those reasons canhardly be said to be valid save and except perhaps one and that is the question of penalty or liquidated damages. In <u>Panalpina (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Ulrich haldemann</u>, Hunter J. ruled in the following terms:- </p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"          In my judgment the phrase 'sum of money' must be construed in the light of the fact that practically every claim for 'breachof a term...of a contract' will be for damages unliquidated in law but quantified in practice. It follows, I think that the phrasemust cover such claims. I agree with Roberts, C. J. that the legislature anticipated a 'quantified' claim and a claim that was 'ascertained'or ascertainable. But I regret that I cannot agree that this makes the claim one for liquidated damages, or that it limits the tribunal'sjurisdiction to such claims. This conclusion seems to me to be supported by paragraph 3. No claim 'founded in tort' can be for liquidateddamages. It may contain a calculated or special damages element; but the bulk is likely to be for general damages. I am much comfortedto know that the, same conclusion was reached by O'Connor, J. on. 18th December 1979 in Stewart and Others v. The Hong Kong PhilharmonicSociety Limited, H. C. Civil Action No. 3031/79."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The judgment of Hunter, J. came before the Hong Kong Philharmonic Society Limited but rafter the National Ebauch and as such judgmentbeing the latest must have the command of the day. It can readily be seen from Panalpina that the "sum of money" is not only limitedto liquidated damages generally in the pleading sense but also extends to a "quantified" claim and a sum that is either "ascertained"or ascertainable. In this case, on the face of it, 3 months wages in lieu of notice in the circumstances of the case is hardly apenalty. Even in doubt, the question of penalty or liquidated damages should have been decided as a preliminary matter of law bythe learned Presiding Officer as required of him under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.16</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> to avoid delay and prejudice to the parties interest. In fact, the matter had been delayed for over 18 months, if not almost 2 years,with unfortunate and very unsatisfactory outcome up to-date. I say no more about it with every respect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>RULING ON NO CASE</u></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The submission of no case is based on the main ground that there was no privity of contract between the parties in the pleaded caseof the plaintiff to which Mr. Mitchell is joining issues and submits that the pleadings are not so fundamentally defective as toamount to no case albeit not perfect. There is the further submission that as far as the second limb of a full accord as to the termsof termination of service was concerned, that consideration as an essential of pleading is not there. The main question calling fordecision is really firstly whether there should be a case and secondly if there is no case, whether I should allow the applicationfor amendment with the necessary interlocutory and consequential amendments to all the pleadings as may be necessary so that I cancarry on with the case to its bitter end.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As rightly agreed by all concerned, it was long and well settled company law for our purpose that a subsequently incorporated companycould not ratify or adopt a contract that was entered into between other parties as a pre-incorporation contract. This branch ofthe law equally applies to the contract of employment as will be seen later. See <u>Pennington on Companies Law</u>, 4th Edition, pp.88-90 and cases cited thereunder. As rightly submitted by Mr. Mitchell, subsequent conduct after the company wasincorporated could in certain circumstances, if their evidence so warranted it, constitute a new contract and equally correctly pointedout by Mr. Chan such conduct must be necessarily referable to the making of a new contract (See <u>Natal Land &amp; Colonization Co. v. Pauline Colliery &amp; Development Syndicate</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%20A%20C%20120" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) A.

In givinghis majority judgment, (save and except Lord Romer) Lord Simon had this to say at p.1204:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The word 'contract' does not appear in the section at all, and I do not agree with the view expressed in the Court of Appeal (overrulingthe Court of Appeal earlier decision - noted by me) that a right to the service of an employee is the property of the transferorcompany. Such a right cannot be the subject of gift or bequest; it cannot be bought or sold; it forms no part of the assets of theemployer for the purpose of administering his estate. In short, s.154 when it provides for 'transfer' is providing in my opinionfor the transfer of those rights which are not incapable of transfer and is not contemplating the transfer of rights which are intheir nature incapable of being transferred. I must make it plain that my judgment is limited to contract of personal service withwhich the present appeal is concerned...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>And the Noble Lord further elaborated:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the second place, if the Legislature really desires that the workmen should be transferred to a new employer without their consentbeing obtained, plainer words can be devised to express this intention. I cannot regard s.154 as plainly authorizing this resultand, in my view, the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below......"</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is noted that in Nokes the claimant was in fact the workman as in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In <u>Cooke v.

B. 1125</a> at 1130 Banker, J, (as he then was) had observed to the effect that it would be too late for a defendant to say that considerationwas not pleaded in a subsequent actions subsequent to the first in which the defendant had conceded to arrears of rent. The observationwas made in the context of estoppel relying on the celebrated case of <u>Humphreys v. Humphreys</u> (1910) 2K. B. 531 and the facts in that case with the striking feature of admission as to liability hence consideration were differentfrom those in this instant case. Therefore Cooks has really no application to our situations.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I have refreshed myself of the fundamentals of pleadings by referring to <u>Bullen &amp;</u> <u>Leake on precedents of Pleadings</u>, pp. 120-122 and p.345 and the cases quoted thereunder suffice to put it on record as follows :-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="82%" valign="top" class="quote">                          The general rule that every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claims defence or othermatters pleaded applies to allegations of every kind contained in every pleading.

On reading the pleadings with particular regard to the statement of claim and particularsthereof as a whole, it can hardly even be inferred that such a new contract was pleaded. Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the statement of claimin particular put me beyond any doubt of what I had stated. In short, the pleaded case of the plaintiff was founded on the pre- incorporationcontract taken ovens adopted or rectified if one likes, by the defendant company after its incorporation. As we have seen this couldnot have been legally valid and enforceable. In other words, as pleaded, it is not part of the plaintiff's case of a new contractand the defect goes to the root of pleadings. The plaintiff adduced in evidence part of her case different from the, pleadings. Norhas the defendant in his pleadings conceded in any way to a new post-incorporation contract. Owning the incorporated book shop bydefendant is quite another matter from having entered into a service contract with the plaintiff. Bearing in mind of the fundamentalsof the pleadings which no doubt are there not only for expedient time-and-cost-saving purposes but also for the general interestof the administration of justice, and having again reminded myself of what I have above-stated, I rule that the defendant has nocase to answer and the action is discontinued albeit not dismissed on the merits without prejudice to the plaintifft's rights toinstitute fresh proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I use the acrd "discontinued" instead of dismissed as an analogy to "non-suit" which is no longer used in those modern days (see<u>Odgers' on Principal of Pleadings &amp; Practice</u>, 22nd Edition, pp. 298-299).</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It is true that as far as procedure and pleadings are concerned, the District Court tends in practice to be not as formal as theHigh Court.

London Brick Co. Ltd</u>, (1971) 4 K. I. R. (Knights Industrial Report - obtainable only from the Attorney General's Chambers Library) it was held that itwould be wrong to allow an amendment at the close of the evidence or even at an extremely late stage of the trial where it couldresult in a party being confronted with an entirely <u>new case</u> (emphasis by me) while fully appreciating that Rawding was a rather extreme case in which all the evidence had been closed as oppositeto only plaintifft's case here and in which there was a clear element of the other side having been taken by surprise, the principalenunciated in Rawding or one of the principals that a court should be slow to allow an amendment which would result in a party beingconfronted with an entirely now case is relevant to our purposes. After all, pleadings are there to enable the other party to meetthe plaintiff's case and it would be against the spirit of pleadings to divert from it unless for obviously good reasons. In thisinstant case, amendments would mean a different cause of action were to be had.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Granting the application for amendments would prejudice the defendant by having to go through the ordeal of an unnecessarily prolongedhearing incurring time and cost for further interlocutory matters, consequential amendments to pleadings, an adjournment be it shortor long, re-opening of the plaintiff's case for further cross-examination let alone the defence case which I anticipate will takeat least another week if not more for actual hearing and thus depriving the benefit of the end of the day. Above all, the evidencefrom which the Court may draw the inferential conclusion of a post-incorporation contract is far from clear-cut. While there is evidencefrom the plaintiff that Educational publisher House was her employer, the evidence to support that the defendant company The HarrisBook Co. Ltd. had entered into a new contract of the employment with her was somewhat scanty. Pp. 8 &amp; 9 of the bundles of documentsExh. P1 refer. There is no evidence therefrom that the defendant was the employer at the time of the alleged constructive dismissal.Nor the letter-heads in the name of the defendant on pp. 65, 78 &amp; 79 etc. necessarily refer to a new contract. Nor even the InlandRevenue on p.146 as commission not salaries were the subject matter for taxation therein and as the remuneration of the plaintiffwas paid in the form of consultancy fees to Pioneer Engineering Company, a company owned by the plaintiff's husband and perhaps theplaintiff jointly. Such inconclusive evidence which may appear in the first sight to be somewhat in favour of a new contract cannotreally hold together when viewed in the light of the overall evidence that E. P. H. which appears to be the employer was a differentlegal entity from the defendant company, the former being the holding company of the latter (incidentally M. P. H. referred to onp.7 &amp; 8 as having ceased business was yet a third company, another subsidiary of E. P. H ). It is doubtful, to say the least,on the face of the evidence as the plaintiff stands as to whether an inference can be drawn on balance of a new contract bindingthe defendant's company. It is net unlikely that at the end of the day a court in the function of a reasonable tribunal of factsmay net drag such a conclusion. Indeed it may very well be in the interests of the plaintiff to start a fresh action whereby E. P.H. will be joined as a co-defendant to the Harris Book Co Ltd to avoid the considerable risk of losing out for want of privity ofcontract, even on the merits. I would think that it be in the interest of both parties as well as in the interest of justice to refusethe application to amend, in the circumstances.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>OTHER OBSERVATIONS</u></p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Plain common sense prompts me to make these other observations that as the case was in fact discontinued by sustaining submissionof no case on technicality and not on the merits that res judicata does not appear to be applicable in the context of fresh proceedings.I have this final observation to make. It is only just and fair that a court is slow to decide en technicality and prefers for obviousreason to decide on the full merits of the case, save and except when the technicality is so fundamental that the court has no choicebut has to decide on it. This case is an instance that the Court's hands are so tight that the only reasonable decision is to upholdthe submission of no case and to dismiss the application for amendments.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I should add as I have neglected to do so, that as rightly conceded by Mr. Mitchell, consideration was not expressly pleaded andthat consideration is a fundamental essential of pleadings. It is crystal clear from the pleadings that I cannot come to any inferentialdrawing of pleading consideration. For obvious reason, the 2nd limb of the action of failure to live up to the alleged accord ofterms of termination must fail for, as I rule, fundamental defect of pleading. In the event, the application for amending the statementof claims and the particulars thereof is refused.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>RULING ON COSTS</u></p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I have heard both Counsel in their submissions on costs. I have borne in mind, as stated at p. 299 of Odgers' also referred to, that"the proper time for defendant's Counsel to submit to the judo that there is no case for him to answer is at the close of the plaintiff'scase". However, I an sure what the author had in mind was that it might not be mature for Counsel to make such a submission untiland unless he had heard the full prima facie case of the plaintiff. In this instant case we had a full bundle of documents and therewas no notice of additional evidence to alter, vary, delete from or add to or in any way substitute what were already there in thebundle of documents and pleadings. In my opinion, a few days' costs would have been saved had Mr. Chan insisted on tackling withand requiring the Court t to dispose of the legal issues in a preliminary ruling even before the opening.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The above apart, I must also boar in mind albeit not as a decisive factor, of the somewhat unfortunate experience of the partieswith the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I agree with Mr. Chan that awarding no cost in this case would be tantamount to reading "must" "for" may into Order l8, rule 19 thestriking out order which would create a precedent that cannot be right.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> I agree with Mr. Mitchell that whatever was said before the opening between Counsel and whatever emotional remark was uttered inCourt, there was nothing to prevent Mr. Chan to insist on the Court dealing with the legal issues as preliminary matter.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In the ciroumstances, I award costs to the defendant for the dates of July 12, 13, 15 and 16, being the hearing dates on which thesubmission no case was hoard with the 12th on brief fees basis and the balance on refresher basis (on the ground that even if Mr.Chan had taken the first opportunity at the commencement of the trial to take up the legal issues the plaintiff would still havebeen entitled to a brief fee). There will be Counsel Certificate for Mr. Chan and costs will be on the Upper Scale to be taxed ifnot agreed upon. There will be no order as to costs for the balance of the hearing dates. For clarity, the defend ant will be entitledto costs on the action except the hearing dates on 8-11 July inclusive.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Having again heard Counsel I have to make two consequential rulings. Firstly, as the case is not only one involving some law butalso a rather rare one leave to appeal against all my rulings is granted.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I agree with Mr. Mitchell that in the event of institution of fresh proceedings, it is desirable that this case be heard by me inorder to save time and costs, e.g. dispensation with opening and shortening of the plaintiff s evidence and possibly short-cuttingby My somewhat familiarization with the case. The Deputy Registrar of Victoria District Court is to be informed that in such an eventit is preferable that the case be listed before me for hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I am indebted to Counsel for their useful and helpful assistance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><u>ADDENDUM</u></p>    <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I should have added that in the context of my reference to <u>Nokes</u> and s.154 of the Companies Act, 1929, s.167 of the Pre-1984 Companies Ordinance was taken from s.154 of the 1929 Act and Nokes appliedto Hong Kong prior to the commencement of our Companies Ordinance, 1984 and to this instant case which arose before that S. 32A ofthe 1984 Ordinance which was enacted to suit local conditions and which is novel to its English counterparts has no application tothis case being Legislation subsequent to the event without retrospective effect. S. 32A of course enables the ratification of pre-incorporationof a pre-incorporation contract entered into between strangers.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a>, has no application to this case because the plaintiff was neither a manual worker nor her salaries at all the materialtimes fell within the jurisdictional range of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(2).</a> If applicable, the pre-incorporation contract would have been transferred with the transfer of business of the Harris Boor Co Ltdto the defendant company by virtue of Paragraph 5 of the First Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">( Eric Li )<br />                District Judge</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/1985/8.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
