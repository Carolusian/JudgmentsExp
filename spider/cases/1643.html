The Defendant is one of the two directors and shareholders of alimited company, Bright Wide Investment Limited â a company âspecialisingâ in the development of small houses in the New Territoriesunder the Governmentâs concessionary Small House Policy.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Policy has been described by the Court of Appeal in <i>Chung Miu Teck v Hang Tak Buddhist Hall Association Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 471</a>, 473E-I, in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b><i>The New Territories Small House Policy</i></b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">         This policy, implemented since December 1972, is designed to allow male indigenous villagers of a village which has beenin existence since 1 July 1898 to apply for permission to erect small houses for their own habitation.  Strict limitations applyto the building of such houses.  Under the Buildings Ordinance (Application to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/97" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/121">Cap. 121</a>), a small house is to be no more than three storeys or 27 ft in height with a maximum roofed-over area of 700 sq ft butthe building of such a house does not require the employment of an authorised person or approval of building plans under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123">Cap. 123</a>) (hereinafter referred to as âspecial privilegesâ) which are significant privileges, quite apart from the concessionaryterms mentioned below.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         Where a villager owns his own piece of land either in the village or within 30 ft of it, he is entitled to apply for a freebuilding licence on his land or the Government might agree to grant new building land in return for the surrender of land elsewhere. If he does not own any land in the village, he may apply for a private grant of land from the Government at a concessionary rate,generally between $1,000 and $2,000.  Procedurally, a villager who wishes to make an application is required to complete a standardSmall House Application Form.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At trial, it was common ground that the above represents an accurate description of the Policy.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In this action, the Plaintiff claims that the Defendant or his company, Bright Wide, has helped him to develop a piece of land registeredin the Tai Po New Territories Land Registry as the Remaining Portion of Lot No. 1139 in Demarcation District No. 90 by the erectionof a three-storey small house on it under the Small House Policy, that the Defendant as his attorney under a power of attorney thathad been executed by the Plaintiff in the Defendantâs favour sold the individual floors in the building to separate purchasers,and that the Defendant has failed to account to him the proceeds of sale in the total sum of $4.45 million.  In final submission,counsel said on behalf of the Plaintiff that notwithstanding what has been claimed in the amended statement of claim, the Plaintiffis prepared to give credit for all the out-goings relating to the construction of the building and the sale of the building, includingthe building costs and the premium that has been paid to the Government for its consent to the sale of the building.</p>    <p class="heading">Defendantâs evidence</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is denied by the Defendant, who gave evidence at trial.  The Defendant said, in essence, that at the materialtime â 1994 and 1995, his company was planning to develop land in the relevant part of Tai Po.  It had entered into a number ofagreements with landowners in that area for mutual cooperation in the development of their respective pieces of agricultural land;small houses were to be erected on their land, partly for sale and partly for retention by the landowners.  The development planinvolved complicated sub-division, amalgamation and exchange of different pieces of land.  Amongst others, Bright Wide had enteredinto a Chinese agreement dated 13 July 1994 with the father of the Plaintiff (âthe fatherâ) for the development of the fatherâsland known as Lot No. 1109 in DD 19.  The agreement said that the lot would be developed into three buildings.  However accordingto the evidence and explanation of the Defendant in the box, given the elongated shape of Lot 1190, no small house could be erectedon the lot without its amalgamation with other pieces of land.  That involved some sub-division, land exchange and amalgamation work. Eventually, it was decided, so the Defendant said in evidence, that Lot 1190 would be divided into various sections, and SectionF of it together with the adjacent Lot 1194B would be utilized for the erection of one small house, and Section G together with theadjourning Lot 1194C for the erection of a second small house, whereas a totally separate lot, i.e. Lot 1139RP (the subject lot)belonging to Bright Wide itself would be used for the construction of the third small house.  In fact, Lot 1194B and Lot 1194C belongedto another owner who had agreed with Bright Wide to participate in the development plan.  Land exchanges were thus effected and newlot numbers were given by the Government regarding the amalgamated Lots 1190F and 1194B (Lot 2451) and the amalgamated Lot 1190Gand Lot 1194C (Lot 2453).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The terms of cooperation between the father and Bright Wide, subject to the above explanation, were set out in the Chinese agreement,which is reproduced below:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â                                      <u>åä½åè­°</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">                                                                        1994å¹´7æ13æ¥</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Our ref 003.ks2</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ç²æ¹ï¼åºè³æ¹ï¼ï¼<u>æåæè³æéå¬å¸</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ä¹æ¹ï¼åºå°æ¹ï¼ï¼<u>å¼µæç¦</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">åä½å°æ®µèç¢¼ï¼<u>æææ°æ</u> <u>DD19 LOT NO</u><u>ï¼1190</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">éæ¹åæå±ååä½ç¼å±ä¸è¿°å°æ®µæä¸åº§è¥¿ç­çå¼é«ç´ä¸å±ã</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ä¸ï¼åèªä¹è²¬ä»»1ï¼ç²æ¹ä¹è²¬ä»»ï¼</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.         è² è²¬è¨­è¨åç­åï¼ä»¥è¿½æ±å®ç¾åæå¤§å©æ½¤çºååï¼</p>            <p class="quote">b.        è² è²¬å»ºç¯è²»ï¼å¾å¸«è²»ï¼åå²è²»ï¼äº¤éæé¬è²»ï¼å»£åè²»ï¼è¡æ¿è²»ï¼ä½£éåå¶ä»éè²»ã</p>            <p class="quote">c.         è² è²¬ä¸æ¬è²»åè£å°å¹è²»ä¹å£¹åã</p>            <p class="quote">d.        ç²æä»¥å¨æ¬åæ¿åºç³è«æææçºã</p>            <p class="quote">e.         è² è²¬æ¨é·æ¨å®ï¼é¸æé©åæéååçå¹é¢åºå®ã</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">2ï¼ä¹æ¹ä¹è²¬ä»»ï¼</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.         è² è²¬åºå°ï¼å³ä¸è¿°å°æ®µï¼ã</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">b.        è² è²¬ä¸æ¬è²»åè£å°å¹è²»ä¹å£¹åï¼æ«ç±ç²æ¹ä»£çºæ¯ä»ï¼ç´å°è³éåç± ææå¿é ç¡æ¯ééçµ¦ç²æ¹ã</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">c.         åèª¿åéæ°ä¹éä¿ã</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">d.        åå©æ±ºå®ä¸æ¬äººé¸ï¼å®å¹ï¼äº¤ææ¢ä»¶åä»»ä½æçºã</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">e.         å æ¿åºæ¿ç­æäººçºå½±å®é»æ­¢åä½ç¼å±ï¼åéæåå°å³ææ­¸éçµ¦ä¹æ¹ï¼æéè²»ç¨äº¦ç±ç²æ¹è² è²¬ã</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">f.          ç²æ¹ç¡æ¬å°ä¹æ¹ä¹å°æ®µæ¥­æ¬ä½ä»»ä½è²·è³£ã</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">äºï¼å©çåéï¼</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">         åå¹³ååå¾æ¨å®é·å®å¹ç¸½é¡ä¹å£¹åï¼æèååå¾æ¨å®å£¹åã</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ä¸ï¼æè³æéï¼</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">         ç²æ¹å¾ä¹æ¹åæå¾å³é¦¬ä¸å§æå¾å¸«ï¼æ¸¬éå¸«åå¥½åå°è½åååå²ï¼ä»¥ååæ¿åºå¥ç´ç³è«å»ºå±çç§ãæ¹[å]å±çï¼åå·¥ç´å¾12åæå§å®æå¨é¨å»ºç¯å·¥ç¨ã</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">       [signed]                        [signed]                     [signed]</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">______________         _____________       _____________</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">      ç²æ¹ç°½å                  ä¸­éäººç°½å               ä¹æ¹ç°½åâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is the Defendantâs evidence that further to the Chinese agreement, it was subsequently agreed between Bright Wide (representedby him) and the father that the father would provide the three indigenous villagers that were required for the erection of the threesmall houses under the Chinese agreement, namely his three sons including the Plaintiff.  The parties agreed that the three sonswould become the owners of the three plots of land (after the divisions and land exchanges were effected) on which the three houseswere to be built.  In their names and in their capacity as indigenous villagers eligible under the Governmentâs concessionary SmallHouse Policy, they would apply, through Bright Wide, to the Government for building licences to erect their small houses on the threelots in question.  Upon completion of the houses, premiums would be paid to the Government for its consent to the sale or dispositionof the houses, and either the profits or the retained houses (or storeys) could be divided amongst the father and Bright Wide inaccordance with the terms of the Chinese agreement.  It was agreed between the father and Bright Wide that each of the three indigenousvillagers would be paid $250,000.00 for so making available their indigenous rights under the Small House Policy for the benefitof the intended development under the Chinese agreement.  The money would be paid after completion of the three houses.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant said in evidence that under those circumstances, he on behalf of Bright Wide came into contact with the Plaintiff,to whom Bright Wide, as part of the scheme, assigned Lot 1139RP (the subject lot), so as to make the Plaintiff the (paper) ownerof the land.  The assignment named a price of $100,000.00, which was in fact not paid.  Rather, a declaration of trust was executedby the Plaintiff in favour of Bright Wide, acknowledging his trusteeship of Lot 1139RP.  A power of attorney was executed at thesame time as the assignment and the declaration of trust, appointing the Defendant as the attorney of the Plaintiff to handle thesale and other dispositions of Lot 1139RP.  Further, to cater for the eventuality of the untimely death of the Plaintiff prior tothe successful construction of the building and its sale, a will was executed by the Plaintiff appointing the Defendant as both hisexecutor and beneficiary of Lot 1139RP, so as to protect Bright Wideâs interest in the deal.  All these documents were executedtogether on the same day in the office of a firm of solicitors, namely Messrs Kenneth Woo &amp; Co. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Defendant said that after the documents were executed, Bright Wide successfully applied to the Government for a building licenceto erect a small house on Lot 1139RP, retained contractors to erect the small house which was completed, successfully obtained allnecessary documents from the Government regarding the completion of the construction work, paid the premium and successfully obtainedthe Governmentâs consent to the alienation of the small house.  Moreover, the Defendant as attorney of the Plaintiff sold the threestoreys in the small house to various purchasers, two in December 1999 and the remaining one in March 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  According to the Defendant, the development of the other two houses under the Chinese agreement between the father and Bright Widecould not be completed, due to subsequent difficulties encountered relating to the site and disagreement between the two sides regardingtheir respective responsibilities, despite the grant of the Government building licences to the other two sons of the father forthe erection of the respective small houses.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Defendant therefore says in the present action that the Plaintiff had no beneficial title or interest in the subject land (Lot1139RP) or the building erected thereon, or the proceeds of sale of the same.  He was a mere trustee of the land and building, holdingthe same on trust for Bright Wide.  His only entitlement is the sum of $250,000.00 in respect of the âsaleâ of his indigenousright to Bright Wide for the erection of the house on Lot 1139RP.  After the commencement of proceedings, Bright Wide has throughsolicitors offered to pay the Plaintiff the sum of $250,000.00, which was rejected by the Plaintiff, who has been insisting thathe was the legal and beneficial owner of the land and building erected thereon prior to its disposal (without his knowledge) by theDefendant, and there was no question of his selling his indigenous right to Bright Wide for any price.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiffâs evidence</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff alone gave evidence in support of his claim.  He said that although he was aware of the Chinese agreement enteredinto by his father and Bright Wide for the development of Lot 1190, and his fatherâs intention to include him as one of the threeindigenous villagers that would provide their rights for the erection of the three houses, he did not agree to his fatherâs suggestionand actually was not aware of his fatherâs purported agreement with Bright Wide for the use of his indigenous right for the developmentof one of the three houses on Lot 1190.  In any event, he insisted in evidence that the Chinese agreement between his father andBright Wide related to the development of Lot 1190, and Lot 1139RP had nothing to do with the development plan under the Chineseagreement.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Plaintiff, who was at the material time 24 or 25 years old with Form 5 education, said that it was his intention to deal withhis own indigenous right separate from his father.  His idea was to acquire land for the building of a small house; he would selloff two storeys and keep the third one for his own occupation.  He said that the Defendant is the son of a well-known and respectedgentleman in the Tai Po area and ran an estate agency business which was well known in the locality in connection with the developmentof small houses.  Through the introduction of a senior fellow villager who was also a director and shareholder of Bright Wide, hecame to know the Defendant, who told him that there was a piece of land (Lot 1139RP), the owner of which wanted to sell the sameurgently for cash.  He was interested â he had in fact applied to the Government for a concessionary grant of land for the erectionof a small house which had thus far not been successful.  He thus agreed with the Defendant for the purchase of the land from theowner for the price of $100,000.00.  He also entered into an oral agreement with the Defendant (or his company) for the latter tohelp him to erect a small house on the land, with all out-goings (including building costs and premium) to be advanced by the Defendantâsside first.  The same would be deducted from the sale proceeds of two of the storeys of the building to be erected.  He said thatno written agreement was signed.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff said in evidence that through the introduction of the Defendant, Messrs Kenneth Woo &amp; Co. were retained to preparethe necessary legal documents.  Prior to his attending the solicitorsâ office for the execution of the documents, he had attendedthe Defendantâs office to pay him the purchase price in cash.  He explained in evidence that in fact the bulk of the money ($80,000.00)was advanced by his parents, whereas he made up the difference from his own savings â he having been working as a garment qualitycontroller. He said that neither he nor his parents had any current accounts, although he had three savings accounts with three differentbanks at the time.  He thus paid the Defendant in cash, who did not issue him any receipt.  He said that receipt would be acknowledgedin the legal documents to be executed.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Plaintiff said that on or about 22 February 1995 he attended Messrs Kenneth Woo &amp; Coâs office, and there he met a malefrom the solicitorsâ office (he could not be sure whether that person was Mr Kenneth Woo â the principal of the firm), who tookout a stack of documents and told him to sign at various places (marked with a cross).  The gentleman did not interpret to him theEnglish documents nor did he explain to him what they were; he was simply told to sign documents.  He said that he trusted both theDefendant and the lawyer and signed the documents accordingly, thinking that they were the necessary legal documents for his purchaseof the subject lot.  He said that he noted that his name had been printed in the documents and the figure of $100,000.00 had beenset out in the documents.  He said in evidence that he asked for a copy of the documents, but was told that no copy would be givento him.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  That notwithstanding, he was content with the arrangement, and thereafter he cooperated with the Defendant in making an applicationto the Government for the grant of a building licence and attending to other necessary procedures for the erection of a small houseon his land.  Eventually to his knowledge the building was completed, but he was not aware of the sale of the building to purchasersuntil September 2000 when he received a letter from the Inland Revenue enquiring into the supposed profits that he had made on thesale of the small house.  He said in evidence that he had noticed that the building had been erected and persons had been occupyingthe premises, but not until the receipt of the letter from the Inland Revenue and the making of inquires by him thereafter did hefind out that the building had been sold by the Defendant by using a power of attorney that he had apparently signed in favour ofthe Defendant (without his knowing about it).  He thus chased firstly Messrs Kenneth Woo &amp; Co. for the documents that he hadsigned, and subsequently commenced the present action against the Defendant to recover the sale proceeds. </p>    <p class="heading">Kenneth Wooâs evidence</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The sole proprietor of Messrs Kenneth Woo &amp; Co, Mr Kenneth Woo, gave evidence on behalf of the Defendant.  He said that he wasexperienced in handling transactions involving the development of small houses in the New Territories.  He explained that in thetransaction in question, he was instructed by the Defendant and Bright Wide to prepare legal documentation for the development ofa small house on Lot 1139RP â with the land coming from the Defendant and indigenous right provided by the Plaintiff.  As per hisinstructions and his usual understanding of this type of transactions, the Plaintiff would only be a nominal owner of the land, whichwould (together with the building to be erected thereon) remain beneficially owned by Bright Wide.  Thus he prepared an assignment,which on the face of it said that the subject land was thereby sold and assigned by Bright Wide to the Plaintiff as purchaser fora consideration of $100,000.00 â the receipt of which was actually acknowledged in the assignment itself; a declaration of trustwhereby the Plaintiff declared that he held the land on trust for Bright Wide, and that the purchase price was in fact provided byBright Wide; a power of attorney by the Plaintiff in favour of the Defendant authorising the latter to sell or dispose of the landand building on his behalf; a will of the Plaintiff naming the Defendant as both the executor as well as the beneficiary of the land;and a statutory declaration whereby the Plaintiff declared that he was an indigenous villager with a right to apply for the erectionof a small house.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Woo said in evidence that as per his usual practice, when the Plaintiff attended his office together with the Defendant to executethe documents, he explained the gist of the whole scheme to the Plaintiff, and interpreted the contents of the documents to him. The Plaintiff expressed to him his agreement to entering into the scheme and executing the documents to effect the same.  The Plaintifftherefore executed the documents in his presence.  He denied that the Plaintiff ever asked him for a copy of the executed documents,but he said in evidence that he had in fact of his own volition explained to the Plaintiff that without his clientâs instructionshe could not release any copy to the Plaintiff.  Mr Woo said that according to what he had learned from his client and his own knowledgeand observation, he was quite sure that the Plaintiff had never paid the Defendant the stated consideration in the assignment, i.e.the sum of $100,000.00.  He said that there was no reason for the Plaintiff to do so, for this was a case where the developer wasmerely making use of the Plaintiffâs indigenous right to apply for permission to erect a small house on a piece of land that wasactually owned by the developer.  He accepted that he was not privy to the agreement between the Plaintiff and the developer or theterms thereof whereby the Plaintiff agreed with the developer for the latter to make use of his name to apply for permission to erectthe small house.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings of fact</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  So far as factual disputes are concerned, I have borne in mind the burden and standard of proof.  I have considered the contentof the witnessesâ evidence as well as their demeanour in Court.  I have considered the inherent probabilities and improbabilitiesof the competing versions.  I have borne in mind not only the oral evidence, but also the documents as well as the background circumstances. I have also borne in mind the submissions of counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Having done so, I have come to the conclusion that the Defendantâs evidence is to be preferred.  So far as demeanour is concerned,whilst the Defendant was cautious in his evidence and occasionally took his time in answering questions, I am satisfied that basicallyhe was telling the truth in the box.  The Plaintiff, who was self-confident and slightly argumentative in the box, did not particularlyimpress me with his evidence.  Mr Woo, the solicitor, was by and large straightforward in his evidence, although understandably,he was slightly apprehensive when he was cross-examined on the legality of the documents that he had prepared for the parties tosign.  Pausing here, it should be pointed out that in the pleadings, a case of fraud has been pleaded on behalf of the Plaintiffnot only against the Defendant, but also against Mr Woo, regarding their procuring the Plaintiff to sign the various documents, whichthe Plaintiff was allegedly led to believe to be mere documents to effect the sale and purchase of land.  However, no allegationof fraud was put to Mr Woo during cross-examination, and in final submission, Miss Ng appearing for the Plaintiff expressly disavowedany intention to pursue fraud against Mr Woo.  Her case against the solicitor was merely that he failed, negligently or carelessly,to interpret or explain the contents of the prepared documents to the Plaintiff, before asking the Plaintiff to sign them.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  But more importantly, I do find that in comparison, the Plaintiffâs story should not be believed.  According to his story, hebought the piece of land in question because the Defendant told him that the owner was in urgent need of money.  But the objectiveand undisputable fact was that the land was owned by Bright Wide, which was not in need of money.  Rather, Bright Wide was involvedin a general development plan of the area, and there was no reason why Bright Wide should want to sell the land to the Plaintiff. The more logical thing for Bright Wide to do was to persuade an indigenous villager to âsellâ his right to Bright Wide so thatit could make use of his name and right to develop the land.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Moreover, the Plaintiff said that he paid the price of $100,000.00 in cash; he explained that neither he nor his parents had anycheque accounts.  Yet the Plaintiff admitted that he maintained three separate bank accounts (all savings accounts) at the time,saying that as he was not doing any business there was no need for him to maintain any current account.  I find the explanation doubtful. There was no explanation as to why he did not procure the issue of a cashier order to pay for the purchase price.  A major partof the money in question ($80,000.00) was said to have been advanced or lent by the parents, yet neither the father nor the motherof the Plaintiff was called to give evidence in support of the Plaintiffâs case, and no explanation was offered for their absence. In particular, apart from the advance of money to enable his son to acquire Lot 1139RP, the father, if called, would also have beenin a good position to explain to the Court that the development of the small house on Lot 1139RP had nothing to do with the Chineseagreement involving Lot 1190 (as per the Plaintiffâs case) and that his nomination of the Plaintiff as one of the three indigenousvillagers to Bright Wide was done by him unilaterally without the agreement and consent of the Plaintiff.  Yet the father, who isin his sixties and whose health has been said to be average, and who is apparently on good terms with the Plaintiff, was not calledto give evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Not only was the money paid in cash, it was not paid to the supposed purchaser or the solicitors but to the Defendant at his office. And not only so, when the payment was made, no receipt was given.  The Plaintiff was told that receipt would be acknowledged inthe legal documents to be signed at the solicitorsâ office later.  When the legal documentation was eventually signed, accordingto the Plaintiffâs own case, neither the assignment nor a copy thereof (which contained the receipt clause) was supplied to him. Nor was he given any title documents to prove his acquisition and ownership of the land, although he had parted with $100,000.00for the same.  I find all this rather strange and not easy to believe.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Plaintiff said that he had orally agreed with the Defendant that the Defendant would help him to deal with all necessary applicationsand procedures for the erection of a small house on his land thus acquired, would advance all the monies necessary to defray thebuilding expenditure and the premium, and would help him to sell two storeys of the building to be erected.  He said all this remainedan oral agreement and nothing was signed.  This supposed arrangement contrasted sharply with the situation involving the father,where a Chinese agreement setting out the terms of cooperation between the two sides were signed.  Moreover, even the Plaintiffâscounsel admitted in her final submission that under the alleged oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, the Defendantwas to derive very little benefit from the cooperation.  Apart from the commission to be earned in procuring the sale of two storeysin the building, no concrete benefit could be identified.  The Plaintiff said vaguely in evidence that the Defendant or Bright Widewas developing the whole area, and it helped the Defendant to assist him in erecting the small house on the lot in question.  Hedid not elaborate on his answer, and (leaving aside the question of fraud) I have difficulty in understanding how the arrangementwould be commercially attractive or beneficial to the Defendant or Bright Wide, particularly bearing in mind the amount of moneyto be put up by Bright Wide or the Defendant in the first place and the time taken for the completion of the whole process of development. Furthermore, the alleged oral agreement had never been mentioned in the Plaintiffâs witness statement or pleadings as such.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case of fraud against the Defendant does not impress me.  From the angle of the Defendant, he had already enteredinto an agreement with the father in connection with the development of Lot 1190, and the father, rightly or wrongly, had nominatedthe Plaintiff as one of the three indigenous villagers required in connection with the development.  There was no particular reasonwhy the Defendant should have wanted to sell a piece of land already owned by it to the Plaintiff to help the Plaintiff personallyto develop the land, with minimal benefit to himself (the Defendant) or Bright Wide.  Still less would there be any reason why theDefendant should have wanted to practise fraud on the Plaintiff by tricking him into signing documents which had a totally differentmeaning and effect from a straightforward sale and purchase of land for $100,000.00. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The abandonment of the case of fraud by the Plaintiff and his counsel against the solicitor made the Plaintiffâs remaining caseof fraud against the Defendant an even less credible and awkward one to run.  This is because without the solicitorâs active andknowing participation, the success of the Defendantâs supposed plan of fraud would depend on the solicitor acting negligently orcarelessly in failing to interpret the prepared documents to the Plaintiff, thereby causing the Plaintiff to sign something thatdid not reflect the true agreement that he had orally made with the Defendant â a result that was fraudulently intended by theDefendant (who had, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, deliberately given incorrect instructions to the lawyer to prepare the documents).  As Mr Ho, counsel for the Defendant, put itin final submission, the Plaintiffâs case on fraud is âa case of coincidenceâ. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I have listened carefully to the evidence of the solicitor.  I accept his evidence.  I find that there was no reason why he wouldhave failed to explain and interpret, at least in gist, the legal documents to the Plaintiff before his execution of the documents,which also contained interpretation clauses signed by the solicitor himself.  Given the nature of the transaction, and the doubtfullegality of the whole arrangement, the lawyerâs participation in the preparation of the documents was, professionally speaking,rather bother-line in nature, and there was every reason for the solicitor to explain clearly to the Plaintiff the nature of thedeal and to ensure that he agreed to enter into the scheme in question, before asking him to execute the various documents.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In any event, I have carefully compared the competing versions of the Plaintiff and the solicitor regarding execution, and I haveno difficulty whatsoever in preferring the evidence of the solicitor to that of the Plaintiffâs, on a balance of probabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed that he only learned about the completion of the building and the sale of the same to various purchasers inSeptember 2000 when he received an inquiry from the Inland Revenue.  I find all this rather strange, as the land and building inquestion were very near to where the Plaintiff and his family were residing.  The Plaintiff accepted that he had noticed that peoplewere occupying the building.  I find it unconvincing that in those circumstances he and his family members would have been ignorantabout the sale of the property by the Defendant and the moving in of the purchasers to the building.  After all, one is concernedwith a village environment, and the Plaintiff did not live alone (although he was frequently out of Hong Kong) but resided togetherwith his family members.  I find it odd the suggestion that the Defendant could have secretly sold the building in question, andpurchasers could have moved into the building without the knowledge or information of those in the village or the family membersof the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  What happened subsequently is wholly inconsistent with the Plaintiffâs case.  As mentioned above, the father subsequently haddisputes with Bright Wide, and both the father and the Plaintiff retained the same firm of solicitors, Messrs Laurence Pang &amp;Co. to act for them.  Although in a first letter written by the solicitors on behalf of the Plaintiff, the solicitors asserted thatthe Plaintiff was the registered owner of the subject land (Lot 1139RP), in two subsequent letters dated 3 November 2000 and 7 May2001 respectively, the solicitors, writing respectively on behalf of the father and on behalf of the father and three sons (includingthe Plaintiff), clearly asserted that the Plaintiff had offered his indigenous right to Bright Wide in connection with the developmentof <i>Lot 1190</i>, and alleged that Bright Wide had misapplied the Plaintiffâs indigenous right for the development of Lot 1139RP.  In particular,in the letter dated 5 May 2001 written by the solicitors on behalf of, amongst others, the Plaintiff, the solicitors asked the Defendantwhether payment had been fully made for the use of the indigenous right concerned for the erection of the house â a clear referenceto the house erected on Lot 1139RP, as there was no other house erected in connection with the father and sons by Bright Wide.  ThePlaintiff was forced in cross-examination to say that these letters were written by the solicitors pursuant to instructions givenby his father, who might have given very confusing and indeed wrong instructions to the solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As I said, the father was not called to give evidence or to explain the situation; no satisfactory explanation for his absence wasgiven.  Nor was anybody from Messrs Laurence Pang &amp; Co. called to give evidence on what instructions had been received and whythe two letters were written in the way they were written.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Needless to say, the Plaintiffâs story is wholly inconsistent with the declaration of trust, which clearly said that he merelyheld the land as trustee for Bright Wide.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I have carefully considered the story of the Defendant, in particular his explanation that notwithstanding what had been writtenin the Chinese agreement, the development of the three houses under the Chinese agreement would involve utilizing land other thanLot 1190.  That was supported by the fact that for two of the houses intended to be erected, they were to be erected on land comprisingnot only Lot 1190, but also land belonging to others.  It is true that in relation to Lot 1139RP, it was physically separate fromLot 1190.  The Defendant has given his explanation in the box, which I have borne in mind.  I do not find his explanation incredibleor unbelievable.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Having borne everything in mind, based on the entire evidence, as I say, I have no difficulty in preferring the Defendantâs storyto that of the Plaintiffâs, and I accept the evidence of the Defendant and Mr Woo, in preference to the evidence of the Plaintiff,insofar as their evidence differed.  In particular, I find as a fact that the Plaintiff did not pay any consideration for the assignmentof the subject lot (Lot 1139RP) to him; the land was assigned to him to hold as a mere trustee for Bright Wide, he having agreedto âsellâ his indigenous right to Bright Wide so as to enable Bright Wide to develop the subject lot in his name, and that waswhy the land was assigned to him as part of the scheme. </p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiff had no beneficial interest in land and building</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Given those findings, and subject to the question of illegality and a miscellaneous point raised by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiffâsclaim must fail.  It should be remembered that in this action, the Plaintiffâs claim is for the return of the proceeds of sale. That claim is based on the assertion or implied assertion that what has been sold (which resulted in the proceeds in the first place)was beneficially owned by the Plaintiff, since the Plaintiff is <i>not</i> suing as a trustee for somebody having a superior title than Bright Wide â the Plaintiff asserts <i>he</i> was the beneficial owner of the land and building.  Based on my above findings of fact, what has been sold â i.e. the land togetherwith the building erected thereon â wholly belonged (beneficially speaking) to Bright Wide, which had the land transferred withoutconsideration to the Plaintiff, and had paid for all outgoings including the building costs and premium relating to the erectionof the house and its subsequent alienation, save for the Plaintiffâs indigenous right which he had allowed Bright Wide to makeuse of to obtain the necessary agreement of the Government to the erection of the house.  In relation to that latter aspect, however,the Plaintiff has, so I find, agreed to âsellâ his indigenous right to Bright Wide for the price of $250,000.00.  The sale hadbeen concluded, as per my finding, through the agency of the father.  The Plaintiff either authorised his father to make the dealwith Bright Wide or has by his conduct ratified the act of his father.  In those circumstances, subject to counselâs point on illegality,the indigenous right was also Bright Wideâs, and in other words, what has been sold had belonged beneficially to Bright Wide alone. In those circumstances (subject to the matters discussed below), the Plaintiffâs claim for the proceeds must fail. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In the present action, the Plaintiff, does not make any claim for the sum of $250,000.00 regarding the sale of his indigenous right,or alternatively, the value of his indigenous right.  In any event, as per my finding, any such claim would have to be made by himagainst Bright Wide.  (As mentioned above, Bright Wide has offered to pay the sum of $250,000.00 to the Plaintiff.)</p>    <p class="heading">Illegality</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Turning to the question of illegality, the type of schemes in question has been the subject of judicial discussions and decisions,see for instance, <i>Li Pui Wan v Wong Mei Yin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKLRD%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKLRD 84</a>; <i>Best Sheen Development Ltd v Official Receiver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20HKLRD%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 HKLRD 866</a>; and <i>Chung Mui Teck v Hang Tak Buddhist Hall Association Ltd, supra</i>.  In short, the case law is to the effect that the making use of the name of an indigenous villager to apply for the necessary buildinglicence under the concessionary Small House Policy from the Government to develop a piece of land beneficially owned by the developeris illegal in its performance in that under a typical scheme, a false statutory declaration will be made by the villager to the Governmentto the effect that he is the legal and beneficial owner of the land in question and he has not entered into any private arrangementsfor his right under the Small House Policy to be sold to another individual or developer, and the tort of misrepresentation to theGovernment that the indigenous villager is the legal and beneficial owner of the land to be developed will be committed.  Furthermore,according to the authorities, given the illegality of the contract in question, the court will not lend itself to the enforcementof the same by either party.  However, the illegality will not affect any partyâs case if his case does not involve the assertionof any right or the enforcement of the illegal contract. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  At trial, no issue was taken regarding the making of the necessary statutory declaration and representation to the Government, whichas per my findings above, must have been false given the nominal role of the Plaintiff in the transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  As I have analyzed above, the Plaintiffâs case depends on his establishing that prior to the sale of the land and building, thesame was beneficially owned by him wholly or at least partially, since the Plaintiff is not suing as a trustee for somebody witha superior title.  As far as the land is concerned, the decision of Yuen J (as she then was) in <i>Best Sheen</i> is directly against the Plaintiff.  In that case, the learned judge made a declaration in favour of a developer regarding its beneficialownership in the land as the grant of relief would not amount to enforcement of any illegal contract.  As the learned judge pointedout, as a general rule, a party to an illegality could recover his property by virtue of his legal or equitable property interestif he could establish his title without relying on his own illegality.  In that case, the developer was not forced to rely on theillegal contract for the declaration sought.  The illegal contract only explained why it came about that the indigenous villagerwas registered as the owner of the land.  The declaration of trust in that case, according to the learned judge, constituted an expresstrust which could be enforced by the developer irrespective of the illegality.  The judge relied on <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 AC 340.</a>  The judge went on to hold that even if it might be argued that the declaration of trust was somehow invalid because in truth nopayment was âprovidedâ by the developer to fund the purchase of land (â in fact no payment was made, notwithstanding the wordingsof the assignment and the declaration of trust), the developer would still be entitled to rely on his beneficial interest under aresulting trust, which might be implied where an attempted express trust failed.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The position, so far as the land is concerned, in the present case, is exactly the same.  The declaration of trust in the presentcase was also incorrect in the sense that in fact the sum of $100,000.00 had never been âprovidedâ by Bright Wide â the truthis that no such payment had ever been made by the Plaintiff for the âpurchaseâ of the land from Bright Wide.  In my judgment,that is neither here nor there.  Whether under the express declaration of trust or the implied resulting trust, the land belongedbeneficially to Bright Wide.  The Plaintiff did not own the land beneficially.  When it was sold, nothing belonging beneficiallyto the Plaintiff was sold.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Miss Ng, counsel for the Plaintiff, drew a distinction between the present case and <i>Best Sheen</i> by arguing that in <i>Best Sheen</i> the court was only concerned with the land, the building not having been erected.  But in the present case, the illegal contracthad been successfully performed and the building was indeed erected.  A distinction should therefore be drawn between the land andthe building.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Assume as valid the distinction for the time being for the sake of argument, notwithstanding the general rule of law that anythingerected on land becomes part of it, the argument of counsel must fail.  For it is clear from the evidence that the Plaintiff haspaid nothing for the construction of the building and the premium regarding the alienation of the same. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The Plaintiffâs only possible âcontributionâ, if any, was limited to his making the false declaration and misrepresentationto the Government so as to obtain the latterâs grant of the building licence etc. under the Small House Policy.  That, however,is not something that this Court can or should recognize as a legitimate âcontributionâ towards the building.  To do so wouldbe to recognise and enforce the illegality.  Thus analysed, the Plaintiff had contributed nothing to the building itself.  Beneficiallyspeaking, therefore, the Plaintiff owned nothing in the building; when it was sold, nothing belonging beneficially to the Plaintiffwas sold. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Again the illegal contract explained why Bright Wide contributed to the construction costs and premium.  Yet in the analysis above,Bright Wide need not ask this Court to enforce any right arising out of the illegal contract in order to establish its contributiontowards the construction costs and premium. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In any event, even if Bright Wide were not entitled to refer to the construction costs and premium that it had contributed towardsthe erection of the building and its subsequent sale, it would not mean that the Plaintiff had contributed anything (that is recognisedby law) towards the same.  In the absence of any contribution from the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff would not be able to establish anybeneficial ownership in the building itself, and that would equally be fatal to the Plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In those circumstances, even if one were to separate the land and building and analyse the same separately, the Plaintiff failsto establish any beneficial ownership in the same, and since he is not suing as a trustee, that failure must fatally defeat his claimfor the proceeds of sale.  There is no question of this Court recognizing or enforcing any illegal contract as such, which only providedthe factual explanation for the conduct of the parties. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  For the above reasons, I reject the Plaintiffâs argument based on illegality.</p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Finally, as regards <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219">Cap. 219</a>), referred to by Yuen J in <i>Best Sheen</i> (see page 875B-H) (âUnless a contrary intention is expressed in the assignment, an assignment shall operate to assign all the estate,right and interest in the land assigned which the assignor has in that land and which he has power to assignâ), I do not believethat that section has the effect of precluding a resulting trust from arising, unless the intention should appear in the assignmentitself. </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Where land is conveyed to a party without any consideration, as a matter of law, a presumption of resulting trust would arise. Almost by definition, in the assignment itself, there would not be any mention of any trust or a reservation of the beneficial interestin the assignor.  Yet there can be no doubt that a presumption of resulting trust would arise unless the assignor and assignee arehusband and wife, father and son/daughter, and so forth, in which case a presumption of advancement would arise.  In my judgment,if <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> were to have the effect of requiring an intention for the creation of a trust to be expressed in the assignment itself, it wouldpreclude a resulting trust from ever arising in most cases.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Although <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> was not specifically mentioned, the discussion of Deputy Judge Lam (as he then was) in <i>Ip Man Shan Henry v Ching Hing Construction Co.

According to the learned judge, there is a distinction between cases where the written document containsan expressed declaration of trust concerning the beneficial interest in the property and cases where the document does not containsuch a declaration.  In the former class of cases, there is no room for the application of the doctrine of resulting, implied orconstructive trust unless and until the conveyance is set aside or rectified.  The declaration in the document determines the vestingof the beneficial interest.  However, in the latter class of cases, the way is open for persons claiming a beneficial interest torely on a resulting, implied or constructive trust.  There is no need for the document to be set aside or rectified. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In my judgment, neither <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> of the local Ordinance nor section 63 of the Law of Property Act 1925 on which the local provisions are based has the effect of alteringthe above common law position.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  For those reasons, I do not believe that section 17 would prevent a presumption of resulting trust from arising in favour of BrightWide when it assigned the subject lot in question to the Plaintiff without any consideration, notwithstanding the absence of theexpression of an intention for such a trust to arise in the assignment itself.</p>    <p class="heading">Outcome</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  For all these reasons, I order that the Plaintiffâs case be dismissed. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff pay to the Defendant his costs of the action; such costs are to be taxed if not agreed.
