The question also arises whether in the circumstances of this case the costsof a successful tenant in proceedings for compensation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a> are recoverable by him from the respondent landlord under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s68b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68B</a> of the Ordinance (which precludes any award of costs against an unsuccessful party in any proceedings under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the Ordinance unless that party has conducted his case in a frivolous or vexatious manner) or, alternatively, as compensationunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a> itself.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The appellant ("the tenant") appeals against the order of the Lands Tribunal (Presiding Officer His Honour Judge Scriven) made onthe 12th August 1988 awarding the tenant $63,716 (including a sum of $25,000 costs) against the respondent ("`the landlord''). Thetenant's claim as formulated at the hearing before the presiding officer which occupied no less than four days, was for compensationin the region of $330,000. On appeal he contends that the award was inadequate. The landlord cross appealed on the issues of bothliability and quantum. However at the hearing before before this court he abandoned his attack on the liability issue and confinedhis cross-appeal to challenging the validity of the presiding officer's award of $25,000 compensation to the tenant in respect ofhis costs of the compensation proceedings before the presiding officer.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The tenant's claim was the sequel to an order for possession ("the possession order") made against him by the Tribunal (PresidingOfficer His Honour Judge Downey) on the 9th June 1986 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(2)</a> (b) of the Ordinance requiring the tenant to give up possession of a flat and parking space ("the first flat") in Pok Fu Lam. Thatorder was directed to take effect on the 15th December 1986.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The tenant, who is a practising solicitor, had been in occupation of the first flat since the 15th February 1976, initially undera two year term created by a tenancy agreement dated the 23rd January 1976 and made between the landlord's mother and the tenant.After the expiration of the term the tenancy continued under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the Ordinance at a montly rent, which was increased on the1st June 1984, to $3,515.50. On the 12th November 1985 the Landlord'smother assigned the first flat to him. On the 13th November 1985 the landlord gave the tenant notice to quit the first flat by the14th December 1985. On the 21st December 1985 the landlord applied to the Lands Tribunal for an order for possession of the firstflat under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(2)(b)</a> of the Ordinance on the ground that he reasonably required the premises for occupation as a residence for himself.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The application was strenuously resisted by the tenant who appeared in person and challenged the bona fides of the landlord and allegedthat the assignment and subsequent application were made, not by reason of genuine requirement, but out of spite because there hadbeen previous differences between the tenant and the landlord's mother concerning the tenant's demands for repairs to be effectedto the first flat by and at the expense of the landlord's mother. In the correspondence prior to the hearing resulting in the makingof the possession order the tenant had drawn the landlord's attention to the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8).</a> However the presiding officer found on the evidence before him (including that of both the landlord and the tenant) that a genuinereasonable requirement had been established by the landlord and the possession order was made accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The tenant complied with that order, giving up possession on the 15th December 1986. On the 23rd July 1987 the tenant issued hisnotice of application in the Lands Tribunal claiming compensation (initially $1260,000) against the landlord under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a> of the Ordinance. The claim was opposed both as to liability and quantum. After much time had been taken up by numerous interlocutoryapplications the matter finally came before the Tribunal for hearing on the 19th July 1988.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> At or in the course of the hearing the tenant's claim was formulated as follows by his counsel. The principal amount claimed wasfor $219,000 or alternatively $203,628 for the loss of use and enjoyment of the first flat as a statutorily regulated rent. The firstfigure of $219,000 was claimed on the footing that the regulated monthly rent was $3,675 inclusive of rates, that the current monthlymarket rental value was $12,800 and that a multiplier of 24 (months) applied to the difference between the two rentals ($9,125) produceda claim for $219,000. The alternative sum of $203,628 was produced by a similar calculation with the same multiplier but adoptinga regulated monthly rent of $3,515.50 exclusive of rates and a current monthly market rental value of $12,000. The multiplier of24 was based on the 24 months inhibition imposed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(7)</a> of the Ordinance on the disposition and user of premises by a landlord who has recovered posession of premises under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(2)</a> (b).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> A further claim for the sum of $127,330 was advanced in respect of expenses incurred and time lost by tenant. This claim comprised16 items of expenditure claimed to have incurred in the course of or incidental to two moves which he had made as a result of thepossession order.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On the 5th December 1986 he had entered into an agreement to purchase a flat ("the third flat") in South Bay to accommodate himself.He paid a price of $1.606 million for the third flat, raising a 90 per cent mortgage repayable by monthly instalments which amountedat the the date of the hearing to between $12,000 and $13,000. He completed the purchase on or about the 22nd December 1986 but thethird flat was not yet ready for occupation. Accordingly he had to find temporary acommodation during the period that he was waitingto go into occupation of the third flat. He found such accommodation in Tai Koo Shing where he rented a flat ("the second flat").He gave detailed particulars of this transaction in his pleadings but the only relevant evidence given about it at the hearing seemsto have been to the effect that the second flat was smaller (700 square feet gross) than the first flat (1162 square feet net) sothat his double bed had to be put in the lounge, and that he had paid rent in the form of one lump sum of $10,000 for a term of threemonths less 10 days.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> At the hearing certain facts indicating that the first flat had been lying unoccupied at least until August 1987 were agreed betweenthe parties. The tenant relied upon these facts as giving rise, in the absence of any explanation from the landlord, to the inferencethat the possession order had been obtained by the misrepresentation of the landlord's genuine reasonable requirement of possessionfor occupation as a residence for himself. The landlord called two witnesses, a valuer and a person who had taken photographs ofthe first flat, but elected not to give evidence himself. Understandably the presiding officer felt "led inexorably to the conclusion"that the representation the landlord had made, upon which Judge Downey had made the possession order, "was false and a misrepresentationas to a material fact as to his requirement made before the judge." Although the presiding officer's conclusion that the tenant hadproved that the possession order had been obtained by misrepresentation of material facts was challenged in the landlord's respondent'snotice, the challenge was abandoned at the hearing before this court.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> On the question of quantum the presiding officer rejected the whole of the principal claim for the loss of the use and enjoymentof the first flat at a statutorily regulated rent. He gave this claim, as formulated, careful consideration in a reserved decision,but felt unable to accede to any part of it. By his notice of appeal the tenant seeks to obtain an order upholding his claim underthis head as formulated before the Tribunal (equating mortgage interest paid by the tenant in respect of the third flat with the"loss'' of market rent differential in respect of the first flat), "or such other monthly sum as may be appropriate or proved, for24 months or for such other period as the Court of Appeal may consider appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> As regards the itemised claim amounting to $127,330, the judge allowed only $27,709. This related to six items of expenditure amountingto, to $12,690 which had not, been seriously disputed and a further six items amounting to $15,019 which had been disputed but whichthe presiding officer found to be "true expenses''. The presiding officer rejected the balance of the tenant's claim of $127,330(whichhe found to be $100,121 but which in fact seems to have been $99,621) on the ground that, although the expenditure had been incurredby the tenant, the items concerned were either capital expenditure or "material incidents thereof".</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> However he went on to award the tenant two additional sums of compensation which had not been specifically claimed. The first sumwas $6,007 representing one year's interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the rejected balance of $100,121. The secondsum was $5,000 which the presiding officer added "for the loss of amenity in the form of the general upheaval and inconvenience ofa double move". The total sum allowed, apart from costs, was therefore $38,716.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> None of these sums awarded are challenged by the landlord except the additional sum of $25,000 which the presiding officer allowedfor the tenant's costs of the proceedings before him. I will return to that matter below.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The tenant seeks by his notice of appeal to obtain an order upholding his claim for compensation in respect of three of the itemscomprised in the claim for $127,330 which were rejected` by the presiding officer. Those items are :</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="80%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="bottom" style="text-align:right">$</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="80%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <p>(1) Stamp duty and solicitors' charges and disbursements incurred in acquiring the third flat...................</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="bottom" style="text-align:right">72,081</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="80%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <p>(2) The cost of four new air-conditioners which the tenant installed at the third flat........................</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="bottom" style="text-align:right">14,530</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="80%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <p>(3) The amount of the charges incurred in installing the four new air conditioners in the third flat together with one old one broughtfrom the first flat..............</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="bottom" style="text-align:right"><u>1,650</u></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="80%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="bottom" style="text-align:right"><u>88,261</u></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In addition to the general contention that the presiding officer was wrong in law in rejecting the basis of the tenant's claim for$219,000 or $203,628 for the loss of the use and enjoyment of the first flat at a statutorily regulated rent and for $88,261 in respectof the above mentioned three items of expenditure, the tenant contends in his supplementary grounds of appeal that the presidingofficer has misdirected himself in several respects. It is contended in particular that the presiding officer erred in refusing toequate, for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a> of the Ordinance, mortgage interest payments with rental payments and in awarding interest for only one year. As regards the approachof the presiding officer to the nature of compensation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a>, the presiding officer is said to have wrongly restricted compensation to financial loss and to have wrongly held that compensationwas roughly equivalent to special damages and should not include any punitive element. He is also said to have erred in so far as,he held the tenant's occupation social status and income were relevant factors.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53</a> (8) provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(8) Where a landlord or principal tenant has obtained an order for possession of the premises under subsection (2) and it is subsequentlymade to appear to the Tribunal that the order was obtained by the misrepresentation or concealment of material facts or where suchlandlord or principal tenant is shown to have acted in contravention of subsection (7), the Tribunal or, as the case may be, thecourt referred to in subsection (7C) may order the landlord or principal tenant to pay to the former tenant or sub-tenant such sumas it thinks fit by way of compensation for damage or loss sustained by that tenant or sub a result of the order."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Considering those provisions in their context in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the Ordinance and free from authority it seems to me that they are clearly intended to provide a simple remedy and procedure fora tenant or sub-tenant who is wrongly deprived of his <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> protected domestic tenancy as a result of misrepresentation by the landlord or principal tenant. The tenant who sustains "damageor loss" in this way is entitled to sue his landlord in deceit in ordinary proceedings in the courts but the section provides himwith a simpler and cheaper additional remedy and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s68b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68B</a> protects him from being At risk as to costs provided he does not conduct his case in a frivolous or vexatious manner.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In assessing compensation under the subsection the Tribunal (or the court where subsection (7) has been contravened) may award "suchsum as it thinks fit". I take this to be an indication that the Tribunal may where appropriate use a broad brush when determiningwhat sum to award and that it is not intended to make a minute and lengthy examination into a claim provided that the sum awardedis fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and suppportable on the evidence. There may well be cases where special damages (inthe pleading sense) are proved, such as removal expenditure and additional rent paid for equivalent premises, and constitute theappropriate measure of compensation. However, in my judgment there is nothing in the subsection to indicate that only special damagesare recoverable as "compensation for damage or loss sustained". Despite his reference to special damages in his judgment the presidingofficer seems to have recognised this by awarding the tenant $5,000 in respect of loss of amenity.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The very fact that a tenant is wrongfully deprived of his premises which are protected and regulated under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the Ordinance seems to me to involve loss. This goes without saying in the congested conditions of Hong Kong where even a cubicleis at a premium. If the tenant who loses possession stays with friends or purchases other premises I can see no reason why, in additionto claiming removal expenses, he should not be entitled to such further sum as the Tribunal or court "thinks fit" to determine, tocompensate him for his damage or loss sustained by reason of the loss of his protected tenancy. By analogy with general damages inordinary civil proceedings the presiding officer would perform a jury function in assessing such a sum.  Provided the sum assessedwere reasonable in all the circumstances, I can see no reason why it should not be awarded. Were the position otherwise the impecunioussub-tenant reduced to sleeping in a card board box in the street by reason of a wrongfully obtained order for possession would beunable to recover fair compensation.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> There can be no basis for reacting into the statutory remedy afforded by the subsection any power to award punitive or exemplarycompensation. The provision must contemplate a similar basis for assessing compensation both when it is invoked in criminal proceedingswhich have resulted from a breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(7)</a> and when it is invoked in the case of misrepresentation or concealment of material facts independently of any criminal proceedings.Certainly in the case of a prosecution of a landlord for contravention of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(7)</a> he faces a fine and forfeiture under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(7B)</a>, and subsection (7C) makes it clear that liability for compensation under subsection (8) is in addition to such penalties. As theintention in a criminal case must therefore be to exclude any punitive element from the compensation awarded by a court under subsection(8), the same intention is to be inferred in the case of a claim in the Tribunal in civil proceedings. In the present case therewas in any event no pleading of a claim for exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I can see nothing in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53(8)</a> to indicate that a tenant who is well off and able to purchase his own flat should by reason of his affluence alone be discriminatedagainst in the matter of compensation. However, in fairness to the presiding officer, who dealt with this matter with commendablecare, I do not understand his observations about the status of the parties to have been intended to convey such a meaning. They seemto me to have been directed more to the unusual circumstances of this case and the question whether a tenant who was fortunate enoughto accommodate himself in relative affluence in his own flat was entitled to claim a substantial part of the expenditure involvedfrom the landlord in these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> None of the numerous authorities cited during the hearing of the appeal seems to me to contradict the views I have expressed above.<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53(8)</a> is derived from <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(6)</a> of the Increase of the increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 which contained no link with criminal proceedingsand provided for the court to make an order for such sum "as appears sufficient" as compensation for the damage or loss sustainedby the tenant, whereas section 53(8) has replaced the quoted words with "as it thinks fit".</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Unfortunately most of the cases cited (some of which are referred to in the Rent Acts by R. E. Megarry (11th edition) Vol. I at p.441)are not fully reported and appear only in the Estates Gazettes Reports. It is not always possible to be sure from the report whethera particular case is concerned with a claim based on fraudulent misrepresentation at common law or with a statutory claim for compensationfor misrepresentation under section 5(6) of the 1920 Rent Act or its immediate successor section 19 of the 1968 Act.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The existence of a separate statutory claim for compensation (created by section 5(6) of the 1920 Act) additional to any claim atcommon law or inequity based on fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation was recognised in <u>Thorne</u> v. <u>Smith</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%201%20KB%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 1. KB 3</a>,07 (C.A.) where it was emphasised by Scott L.J. at p.312 that the statutory right to compensation could be established without proofof fraud. Indeed a claim for damages for fraud has been joined with a claim under the statute in England.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Thus in <u>Hunt</u> v, <u>Barnett</u> (1951] E.G.D. 323 the tenant sued in the High Court to set aside a possession order made against him in a county court. He basedhis claim on fraudulent misrepresentation and made an alternative claim for compensation under section 5(6) of the 1920 Act. McNairJ. held that fraudulent misrepresentation was not established but that the possession order had been obtained by concealment of materialfacts. In assessing compensation the judge found that the tenant had incurred removal expenses of Â£2.17s9d and that his annual expenditurehad increased by about Â£30. Rejecting the tenant's contention that he was entitled to the Â£1,000 which the landlord had offeredhim to give up his tenancy, the judge assessed the proper compensation at Â£2,00.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Hunt v. <u>Barnett</u> seems to me to be a good example of a case where a tenant could show only very limited special damage but exercised the functionof a jury in assessing damages in a situation where precise measure can be pointed out except the opinion and judgment of a reasonableman.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> A similar approach was adopted in <u>Engleheart</u> v. <u>Catford</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1926%5d%20EGD%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1926] E.G.D. 352 (C.A.)</a> which is cited in Megarry on the Rent Acts at p. 441 for the proposition that punitive awards are not permissible under the statute,although it is not clear from the report whether the claim was at common law or under the statute. The tenant had given up possessionby reason of the landlord's misrepresentation. He had then bought himself another home for Â£1200. His cost of removal was only Â£4.11s6dbut the jury appears to have awarded him Â£300 for the loss of his statutory tenancy. The Court of Appeal accepted that this figuredwas too high and that the jury had wrongly made a punitive award. However it is significant that a re-assessment of damages on anew trial was awarded. There was no suggestion that the jury was not required to Pit a reasonable value on the loss of a statutorytenancy.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The only reported decision on section 53(8) in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal is <u>Fung Wing-kwong</u> v. <u>The Queen</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20HKLR%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] HKLR 165 (C.A.).</a> That was a criminal prosecution of a landlord for contravention of section 53(7) of the Ordinance. He was fined $35,000 and orderedto forfeit $30,000 under section 53(7B). He was also ordered to pay $25,000 his former tenant as compensation under section 53(8).On appeal the Amount of compensation was reduced to $8,000. In that case the tenant who had given up possession had found alternativerented accommodation which the Court Appeal was prepared to assume was reasonably comparable to the suit premises. He had stayedthere for 10 months, paying more rent than he had paid for the suit premises, and had then moved to larger premises where he hadpaid yet more rent.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The trial judge had awarded compensation based on the actual monthly rental differential between the suit premises and the othertwo premises successively occupied by the tenant for 18 months. The Court of Appeal disallowed inter alia the additional differentialincurred by the tenant in respect of the larger premises. Delivering the judgment of the court Li J.A. observed:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"We do not think that a landlord should be obliged to compensate an evicted tenant for more expensive premises than those which wereavailable to the tenant, if the latter are reasonably comparable to the suit premises."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The Court of Appeal could see nothing wrong with the multiplier of 18 adopted by the trial judge.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Fung's case seems to me to be an example of a case where, in the absence of any claim for removal expenses and inconvenience, compensationunder section 53(8) of the Ordinance was properly capable of being measured by reference to rental differential related to comparablealternative accommodation to which the tenant had moved. It is helpful in that the Court of Appeal indicated that a multiplier of18 (months) was acceptable in such a case and that a landlord is not to be made to compensate a tenant for rental differential excepton the basis of comparability of premises.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Mok relied on the principles applied in a line of English and Hong Kong authority relating to criminal compensation orders. Itsuffices to refer to <u>Reg.</u> v. <u>Vivian</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR 291 (C.A.)</a> where <u>Reg.</u> v. <u>Inwood</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%2060%20Cr%20App%20R%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 60 Cr. App. R. 70 (C</a><i>.A.)</i> was applied and <u>Reg.</u> v. <u>Miller</u> (1976) Cr.L.Rev. 694 (C.A.) was referred to. In <u>Vivian</u> at p.293 the English Court of Appeal applied the following dictum of Scarman L.J. in <u>Inwood</u> at p.73:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Compensation orders were not introduced into our law to enable the convicted to buy themselves out of the penalties for crime. Compensationorders were introduced into our law as a convenient and rapid means of avoiding the expense of resort td civil litigation when thecriminal clearly has means which would enable the compensation to be paid. One has to bear in mind that there is always the possibilityof a victim taking civil proceedings, if he be so advised. Compensation orders should certainly not be used when there is any doubtas to the liability to compensate, nor should they be used when there is a real doubt as to whether the convicted man can find thecompensation."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The Court of Appeal cited <u>Miller</u> for the proposition that an order should only be made when the legal position was quite clear. It did so when about to quash a criminalcompensation order based on a mere estimate for repairs to a car (which the defendant disputed) and expressed the view that ``noorder for compensation should be made unless the sum claimed by way of compensation is either agreed or has been proved ''</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The latter observation was applied by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <u>The Queen</u> v. <u>Chan Lai-ping</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%201241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 1241 (C.A)</a> where the court reduced an award of compensation under section 70B(3) of the Ordinance for "damage, loss or inconvenience suffered"by a sub-tenant due to harassment by his landlord. At p. 1243E, after citing this observation Roberts C.J., delivering the judgmentof the court, said:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"A section of this nature is intended to do no more than provide a form of quick relief. It is not meant to involve the court in thesort of detailed examination of damages which is normally undertaken, for example, in a full claim in contract or tort. Indeed, whenapplying the section, the court should bear in mind the possibility that, in appropriate cases, the victim may resort to civil proceedings.</p>            <p class="quote">The section's purpose is more limited, enabling some immediate compensation to be paid to an injured party for obvious loss causeddirectly by the acts which have been the subject of the charge, and for what is described in the section itself as "inconvenience''.''</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> For my part I consider that it is important to bear in mind the circumstances in which these principles were enunciated and appliedin both <u>Vivian</u> and <u>Chan Lai-ping's</u> case. In the former case the court was considering the quantification of actual damage sustained by a car. In the latter case thecourt had to consider the trial judge's assessment of the sub-tenant's quantifiable loss of profits and accepted the landlord's counsel's contention that the judge had misread the evidence. It is significant that in <u>Chan Lai-ping</u> the court declined to interfere with the judge' assessment of compensation for "inconvenience'' at a figure of $5,000. Roberts C.J.said of this award at p.1243 J:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The judge gives no reason for arriving at a figure of $5,000 for "inconvenience", Such an award is by its nature not related to anyquantifiable loss or damage and we would only have interfered with it if we thought that it was clearly excessive, which we do not.We see no reason why that part of the award should not stand."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> In the course of his helpful and able argument Mr. Mok contended in reliance on the English criminal compensation cases and on <u>Fung's</u> case and <u>Chan Lai-ping's</u> case, that compensation should not be ordered under section 53(8) for loss of a regulated Part II tenancy if the tenant, after goingout of possession, was able to use and enjoy a flat of comparable quality for no rent or at a rent no greater than he paid underhis former regulated tenancy. To award compensation to such a tenant for loss of regulated tenancy would, Mr. Mok contended, be toallow the tenant a windfall profit which is not the intention of compensation. This part of Mr. Mok's argument culminated in thefollowing proposition:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">"The test therefore is <u>not</u> whether a loss is "financial" or not, but whether there is an <u>actual loss</u> at all. If there is no actual loss, no sum should be awarded for the alleged <u>notional loss</u> because that would not be compensation in its true sense."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> This proposition which amounts to regarding compensation under 53(8) as confined, in effect, to expenditure or special damage (inthe pleading sense)actually incurred and accurately quantifiable is one which I am unable to accept. For the reasons I have alreadygiven and in the light of authorities such as <u>Hunt</u> v. <u>Barnett</u> and <u>Engleheart</u> v. <u>Catford</u> I can see no reason why compensation should not be awarded in appropriate circumstances to a tenant in the form of a reasonable sumin respect of his loss of a regulated Part II tenancy as a result of his landlord's misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Approaching the tenant's appeal in the light of the above observations regarding the nature of the compensation payable under section53(8), I consider that the tenant's claim for $219,000 or alternatively $203,628 was rightly rejected by the presiding officer. Theclaim was clearly too remote. The monthly mortgage interest payments made by the tenant were not rent that could give rise to a rentaldifferential claim of the kind which was advanced in <u>Fung's</u> case. Those payment and the monthly instalments of capital were the price of the capital which the tenant had borrowed to enablehim to purchase the third flat. Neither the interest nor the capital repayments were in any sense the equivalent, even for the periodof 24 months (or any appropriate lesser period) of the loss of the advantage of the protected occupation of the first flat at a rentsubstantially below a market rent.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The tenant was not under a general duty to minimise the damage and loss he sustained as a result of the wrongfully obtained possessionorder. He was entitled to buy himself a flat to accommodate himself and to acquire at considerable expense a substantial capitalasset which might increase or decrease in value. However he was not entitled to claim from the landlord as compensation by way ofdamage or loss any greater sum than represented the true measure of the loss of his protected tenancy.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In any event the tenant failed to adduce any evidence segregating the interest from the capital element of his monthly mortgage instalmentsand the presiding officer was not, with respect, entitled to make assumptions regarding the amount of the interest element. Mortgatetransaction vary widely in their terms.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The presiding officer was not asked to determine the value of the tenant's loss of his protected tenancy by assessing a figure inaccordance with what he considered reasonable and just in all the circumstances. He is not therefore to be faulted for failure todo so. However, in my judgment, in a case of this kind where the tenant has not moved to comparable or any rented premises wherehe has had to pay an enhanced rent, but has purchased his own flat as a result of being wrongfully ordered out of his premises, heis entitled to recover something over and above removal expenses and loss of amenity for the loss of his protected tenancy. The sameposition would arise where the tenant stayed with friends or simply slept in the street.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> This approach is consistent with <u>Hunt</u> v. <u>Barnett</u> and <u>Engleheart</u> v. <u>Catford</u>. In my judgment it is also supported by <u>Mafo</u> v. <u>Adams</u> [1970].1 QB 548 (C.A.). In that case a tenant who had been tricked out of his regulated tenancy by his landlord pursued a commonlaw remedy in damages against him. As a result of the loss of his regulated tenancy he had been obliged to stay with friends, forsome weeks and then had obtained new accommodation of his own. There was no evidence that he had paid an enhanced rent for the newaccommodation but it was less commodious than his former premises and it was unlikely to be as securely protected by the Rent Actsas those premises.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The Court of Appeal held that the tenant in that case was entitled to Â£100 damages in deceit for the loss of his protected tenancyand for the inconvenience he had suffered. Widgery L.J. observed at p. 557:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">The principal tangible loss suffered by the plaintiff was that he was deprived of the plaintiff of a flat protected by the Rent Acts,and in the circles in which these parties move possession of such a flat is one of the most significant rights of property that anyof them ever see in their lives. I have no doubt whatever that that was a sufficient loss to sustain the cause of action.''</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Mr. Mok contended that widgery L.J. was there meaning to refer only to security of tenure afforded by the Rent Acts and not to, lossof any rental. Mr. Mok had earlier pointed out by reference to the various Parts of the Ordinance that all tenanted domestic premisesin Hong Kong are afforded some measure of protection of tenure. He contended that, whilst Part II of the Ordinance governing thefirst flat gave security of tenure under sections 52 and 53 and regulated rental under sections 57 to 62 and 64, the tenant's claimin respect of his loss of his protected tenancy in the present case could relate only to the controlled rental under Part II becausehe would have suffered no loss of security of tenure even if he had rented other premises under Part IV (under which the tenant ofdomestic premises is given security of tenure at a market rental).</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> For my part I consider that <u>Mafo</u> v. <u>Adams</u> must be considered in the light of the facts there before the court. The tenant had moved to other rented premises where he had notbeen shown to be paying an increased rent and which appeared to be less securely protected than his former premises. The court couldnot therefore award him any damages for enhanced rent. However it seems to me that when giving him damages, assessed at a reasonablefigure, for the loss of his protected tenancy the court must have been contemplating that the protection lost by the tenant relatednot only to actual tenure but also to the controlled rent, the amount of which is regulated under the English Rent Acts, producingthe result that the rent of a controlled tenancy is usually substantially below a market rent. Without control of rent the actualvalue of such a tenancy to the tenant would be greatly reduced.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> I conclude that in the circumstances of this case the tenant has claimed a sum far in excess of his entitlement, which the presidingofficer has rightly, rejected. Likewise the landlord has wrongly contended that the tenant is entitled to nothing as compensationfor the loss of his protected tenancy, but only to the sums awarded by the presiding officer for expenses actually incurred in orincidental to his two moves and for loss of amenity. Moreover, for the reasons given above, I consider that the tenant is clearlyentitled in the circumstances to a reasonable sum for the loss of his protected tenancy.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> No claim for such a measure of damages was made before the Tribunal. It was not claimed in the tenant's notice of appeal, but inhis supplementary grounds of appeal he had contested the presiding officer's ruling that the compensation to be awarded under section53(8) was roughly equivalent to special damages. In the course of his submissions in support of this ground Mr McCoy for the tenantcontended, rightly in my opinion, that the presiding officer was entitled to make a "jury" award for the loss of a protected tenancy,adding wrongly, that such an award could include a punitive award. Moreover the tenant has always claimed compensation for the lossof his protected tenancy, albeit in accordance with the wrong measure.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In my judgment this is a situation where this court should exercise its powers under Order 60A Rule 5 and Order 59 rule 10(3) and(4) to do justice by ensuring the determination on the merits of the real question in controversy between the parties by awardinga reasonable to the tenant to compensate him for the loss of his protected tenancy at a regulated rent: see <u>Tanner</u> v. <u>Tanner</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20WLR%201346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 W.L.R. 1346  (C</a> .A.) and c.f. <u>Pollock</u> v. <u>Kumar</u> (1977) 242 E.G. 371 (C.A.) where the Court of appeal remitted the assessment (which was lump sum assessment) to the County Courtbecause it was not in possession of the necessary information to make the assessment itself. In the present case this court is inas good a position to make the assessment as the Tribunal. It has all the relevant information.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In assessing a reasonable sum to compensate the tenant for the loss of his protected tenancy I bear in mind that Mr. Mok has stressedthat the tenant complained that the premises were leaking and in a state of disrepair and that his counterclaim against the landlordfor damages in this respect in other proceedings between the same parties was dismissed. I also bear in mind that the last two yearlyincrease of rent in respect of the premises under sections 57 and 64 of the Ordinance was effected in 1984 and that from the 16thDecember 1986 the tenant would have been liable to have his rent  increased to a figure of about $6,120. A further point made byMr. Mok is that under section 74B(1), Part II will expire on the 18th December 1989 unless extended by resolution of the LegislativeCouncil under section 74B(2) but I regard the resultant element of uncertainty as being relatively slight in view of the consistentpattern of renewal in the past.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Bearing in mind those considerations and all the circumstances of the case I consider that a reasonable sum for the loss of the protectedtenancy would be $50,000, whether assessed, by analogy with Lord Denning's assessment of compensation in <u>Tanner</u> v. <u>Tanner</u>, as compensation for a controlled tenancy that should not have been lost, or by analogy with Brightman J.'s assessment in that case,as the amount which the tenant might reasonably have requested and which the landlord might reasonably have been expected to payas the price for an agreement made on the 9th June 1986 (the date of the possession order) for the surrender of the protected tenancyon the 15th December 1986 pursuant to section 52A of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> As regards the additional sums claimed, amounting to a total of $88,261, in respect of stamp duty and solicitors charges and disbursements($72,081), four new air conditioners ($14,530) and the installation of those air conditioners together with an old air conditionerbrought to the third flat from the first flat ($1,650), Mr. McCoy had very little to say in support of these items except for thecost of installing the old air conditioner. Apart from the latter item, which the presiding officer seems understandably to haveover looked, this group of claims was clearly too remote and he rightly rejected them as linked with and incidental to the capitalexpenditure involved in acquiring the third flat. On a rough and ready basis I would attribute $330 (1/5 of $1650) to the cost ofinstalling the old air conditioner in the third flat and increase the compensation by that amount.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> There remains the landlord's cross-appeal on costs. Being of the view that there could be no question of the conduct of the landlord'scase being regarded as having been conducted in a frivolous or vexatious manner, the presiding officer accepted that he was precludedby section 68B of the Ordinance from awarding any costs as such to the tenant in respect of the proceedings. However, being understandablyminded to compensate the for the loss he would compensate the tenant for the loss he would otherwise sustain by way of costs incurredin the proceedings he decided to do so notwithstanding the provisions of section 68B. He explained his decision to take this coursein the following words:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"This applicant has however had to bring his claim to the Tribunal. I was not made aware of any offer to compensate him, and it wouldbe an injustice if he has to bear the costs-that indeed would be a loss. In those circumstances and bearing in mind that counselwere engaged on both sides, I think a sum of $25,000.00 towards his unavoidable legal costs including counsel's fees would be reasonablefor a 4 day hearing."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> With respect to the presiding officer this attempt to drive the proverbial coach and horses though section 68B cannot be sustained.Mr Mok mounted an elaborate and impressive argument in support of the landlord's cross-appeal against this award. For my part I donot find it necessary to deal with all that argument because I think it will not do not to dress up an award of costs in a particularset of proceedings under section 53(8) as damages or loss under that provision in order to circumvent section 68B which expreslyprohibits the award of costs in those proceedings except in circumstances which are not applicable in this cast. I accept Mr. Mok'scontention that, whilst an award of costs qua costs is also a form of compensation, the purpose of section 53(8) is to provide compensationfor loss and damage resulting to a tenant from a wrongfully obtained possession order and not to compensate the tenant for the costshe has incurred in bringing proceedings to obtain obtain compensation under section 53(8).</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Put another way the combined effect of section 53(8) and 68B must, in my judgment, be that the Ordinance contemplates that damageor loss constituting compensation under section 53(8) does not include the costs of proceedings under that provision to recover suchcompensation. Were the position otherwise, as Mr. Mok pointed out, section 68B would be otiose to the sucessful tenant in proceedingsby him for compensation under section 53(8). Such compensation would include his costs incurred in the proceedings whether or notthe conduct of the landlord's case had been frivolous or vexatious. On the other hand the landlord, who can never have claim forcompensation under section 53(8), could not recover his costs under that provision nor could he do so under section 68B unless theconduct of the tenant's case were frivolous or vexatious. A similar situation would arise mutatis mutandis in the case of a landlord'sclaim against a tenant under section 53(9). This would be an absurdly capricious result and cannot be right.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> To the extent that the reasoning of the Tribunal on the costs issue could not be sustained (which is in my judgment the case), Mr.McCoy contended that costs should be awarded by this court to the tenant under section 68B in respect of the section 53(8) proceedings.He argued that, when the presiding officer delivered his judgment in those proceedings it was clearly apparent that the landlord'sapplication in the previous proceedings for the possession order was vexatious. On this footing he sought to support his claim forcosts under section 68B by contending that "case" in that section meant "the case as a whole including the original possession andany consequential proceedings". In the alternative he contended that section 68B should be construed to mean that if a case for possessionwere conducted vexatiously, then costs in remedial proceedings such as those under section 53(8) may be awarded against the partyguilty of such conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> This convoluted argument is demonstrably unsound because it wrongly seeks to equate ''case'' with "proceedings" in section 68B and,in the case of the alternative argument, to control the award of a party's costs in one set of proceedings by reference to the conductof that party's case in a previous and different set of proceedings against the same adversary. I agree with Mr. Mok's basic argumentthat the unambiguous terms of section 68B relating to the costs of "any proceedings under this Part" relate to any particular setof proceedings and that the award or refusal of costs to a successful party in any proceedings to which the section applies is governedby the manner in which the unsuccessful party has conducted his "case" in those proceedings, not his"case" in those and previousrelated proceedings or his case in only the previous proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Accordingly I would allow the tenant's appeal to the extent of increasing the award of compensation by $50,000 (for loss of his statutorytenancy) and $330 (for the cost of the installation of one old air conditioner in the third flat). This has the effect of increasingthe award (excluding costs) from $38,716 to $89,046. I would allow the landlord's cross-appeal and set aside the award of $25,000in respect of the tenant's costs.</p>    <p>Godfrey, J.,</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The facts of this case, and its history, have been set out in the judgment of my Lord Mr. Justice Clough.

It cannot substitute itsown judgment for that of the Lands Tribunal on whether a particular claim should be allowed or disallowed.) The application to theLands Tribunal must be made in writing setting out the nature of the relief applied for and the grounds of the application but noparticular form need be followed : see r.4 of the lands Tribunal Rules.

The section does not create a new tort, to which it would be appropriate to apply the common lawrules to relating to remoteness or measure of damage. As has see been pointed out in relation to a similar section of the ordinance,section 70B(1) "a section of this nature is intended to do no more than provide a form of quick relief. It is not meant to involvethe Court in the sort of detailed examination of damages which is normally undertaken, for example, in a full claim in contract ortort. Indeed, when applying the section, the court should bear in mind the possibility that, in appropriate cases, the victim mayresort to [other] civil proceedings" (see <u>R. V. Chan Lai-ping</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%201241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 1241</a>, per Roberts C.J. at p.1243).</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Section 53(8) confers a power on the court convicting a landlord of a criminal offence under other provisions of the Ordinance toaward a tenant the same measure of compensation as that which he can claim where the landlord has obtained an order for possessionagainst him by misrepresentation or concealment of material facts. It cannot have bee. intended that a court of criminal jurisdictionconvicting the landlord of such a statutory offence should embark on the sort of inquiry appropriate in a civil action for damagesfor deceit; and it cannot have been intended that the inquiry to be conducted by the Lands Tribunal under the same subsection shouldbe of a different nature from that conducted by such a court. The Lands Tribunal must, of course, act on evidence, not on speculation:but, subject to this, it is entitled to make such an award of compensation as it.thinks fit.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> In England and Wales, under statutory provisions similar to those contained in section 53(8), the principal items of damage and lossheld recoverable are removal expenses, legal costs, loss of amenity, net rental loss and the cost of adapting curtains, carpets andthe like where the tenant succeeds in finding other accommodation, some sum in respect of the loss of a protected tenancy and timeand trouble in finding alternative accommodation : Megarry, The Rent Acts, 11th Edition (1988), at p.p. 441, 442.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In the present case, the Lands Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, thought fit to make a total award of $63,716.00. Thisincluded an award, of which the landlord complains, of $25,000.00 for costs. Section 68B of the Ordinance provides, as the LandsTribunal recognized, that no costs can be awarded to the tenant in such proceedings as these, unless the landlord has conducted hiscase in a frivolous or vexations manner. The Lands Tribunal said, in my judgment correctly "There is no question of such conducthere". Before this court, it was argued that, because the landlord had obtained his order for possession against the tenant by misrepresentingthe true facts to the judge who made that order, it necessarily followed that the proceedings before the Lands Tribunal must havebeen conducted frivolously or vexatiously. But, as it seems to me, this does not at all follow. The landlord put the applicant toproof of his case. But that is not the sort of frivolous or vexatious conduct to which reference is made in section 68<strong>B</strong>. The Lands Tribunal tried to get out of the difficulty posed by section 68B by awarding the costs, not as costs, but as part of thecompensation. This will not do. It flies in the face of the plainly expressed intention of those responsible for the ordinance. Thelandlord's cross-appeal, in respect of this award of $25,000.00 for costs, must, in my opinion, be allowed. The error of the LandsTribunal was an error of principle.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> I turn to the appeal itself, in which the tenant complains of the failure of the Lands Tribunal to award compensation for a numberof specified items of damage or loss. There are three of these. The first is, in substance, a claim by the tenant for loss of hisprotected tenancy. The second is a claim for his expenses incurred in relation to his purchase of alternative accommodation. Thethird is a claim for the cost of installing four new air-conditioners at that accommodation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> As to the claim for compensation for loss of the protected tenancy, I am of the opinion that, in principle, this claim was justified.It is not possible, in the present conditions which prevail in Hong Kong, for a protected tenant who loses his accommodation to finda similar tenancy of similar accommodation at a similar rent. If he finds similar premises on similar terms (otherwise than as torent), he will have to pay more for those premises. He therefore suffers a real not a notional, loss. His loss can be quantifiedby reference to the amount which the tenant might reasonably have requested, and which the landlord might reasonably have been expectedto pay, for a surrender of the protected tenancy (compare the reasoning of Brightman, J. in <u>Tanner v. Tanner</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20WLR%201346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 WLR 1346</a>, at p. 1352). However, no suggestion was made in this case, until the last moments of the hearing in this court, that this was anappropriate way in which to calculate the tenant's loss. No suggestion of this method of calculation was raised in the material placedbefore the Lands Tribunal and no evidence was called which would have enabled the Lands Tribunal to have come to any finding as tothe correct amount. In those circumstances it seems to me impossible for this court to entertain the suggestion now. I regret thaton this point I must beg to differ from my Lords Mr. Justice Kempster J.A. and Mr. Justice Clough, J.A.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In fact, the case for the tenant was not put to the Lands Tribunal in this way. The tenant claimed either a notional sum, to be measuredby the difference between the statutory rental of the premises, and the market rental, over 24 months; or, alternatively compensationfor the mortgage payments which the tenant has had to pay in relation to his purchase of alternative accommodation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> As to the first of these, I see no reason to apply by analogy the arbitrary measure of compensation (24 months rental difference)provided for by the ordinance in the case of a contravention of other of its provisions. And, as to the second, I can see no goodreason for allowing the compensation to be measured by reference to the mortgage payments paid by the tenant in connection with hispurchase of the alternative accommodation. These are in no way connected with the loss suffered by the tenant. He might have chosento purchase a much more, or much less, expensive property than the South Bay flat which he did buy; and he might have chosen to doso out of his own resources, rather than out of borrowed money. He might even have chosen to stay with his parents, or with friends.The mortgage payments (whether representing repayments of capital, or interest, or both) are entirely beside the point. What hasto be considered is what sum should be awarded to the tenant to compensate him for the loss of his protected tenancy; the landlordcannot be held responsible for the cost of the particular way in which the tenant chooses to arrange his affairs after he has sufferedthat loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> As to the expenses of purchasing the South Bay flat, there can be no distinction drawn between this point and the one which I havejust considered. These expenses were incurred, like the mortgage payments, in relation to the purchase of the flat.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Lastly, there is the matter of the four air-conditioners. This expense seems to me to be nothing to do with the landlord and nothingto do with the loss suffered by the tenant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> A number of cases were cited to us but they are in my opinion of no assistance. In any event, so far as the second and third claimsare concerned, I cannot see that the Lands Tribunal went wrong in principle in disallowing them. (In fact, I think it was right soto do.)</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> For the reasons I have endeavoured to state, I would dismiss this appeal and allow the cross-appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> I feel bound to add that (as my Lord Mr. Justice Clough, has noted) this case took four days before the Lands Tribunal, and two daysbefore us. Section 53(8) proceedings should never again be conducted at this length. This s no criticism of the Lands Tribunal, whichhad no option but to treat the case with care and patience, as it obviously did.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(G.M.
