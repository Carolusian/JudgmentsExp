Clearly, the other limbs to Order 18, Rule 19, do not apply to thesecircumstances.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The matter concerns a stall at Stanley which had been operated by the plaintiffs and effectively comprised a business selling watchesto tourists. The action is brought on the basis of an agreement dated 29 November 1997 whereby the plaintiffs joined that business.The parties agreed that the value of the existing stock represented by the watches was $250,000 and the defendants agreed to contributeone half of that in consideration of the plaintiffs allowing the defendants to join in as partners in the business.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The story, as it were, is recounted in the various paragraphs of the statement of claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> What is now said is that the defendants have made off with the stock and with some change, I think, amounting to $500 and the plaintiffsseek damages to compensate them for what the defendants are alleged to have done.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Paragraph 13 of the statement of claim is in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Further or alternatively, in reliance of the defendants' operation of the stall, the defendants were in breach of trust to the plaintiffsand had wrongfully misappropriated all the inventory of watches together with $500 change to themselves on 8 April 1998."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> There are then some particulars to paragraph 13 which I can summarise. It is said that in the afternoon of 8 April, the defendant'smisappropriated the goods, that is to say the remaining stock of watches together with $500 change, and as a result the plaintiffshave suffered loss and damage.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Before I turn to the particular complaint made on behalf of the defendants which is said to justify the court now striking out thatparagraph, I should look at the test which the court needs to apply in such circumstances. It is helpful to look at page 349 of theSupreme Court Practice 1999. The principles are said to be the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A reasonable cause of action means a cause of action with some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered.So long as the statement of claim or the particulars disclose some cause of action or raise some question fit to be decided by ajudge or a jury, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Those are the material parts of the note which I need to refer to. So it is clear from that that any party seeking to strike outa pleading or any part of a pleading under this rule has a very high burden to discharge.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I am bound to say, by way of general comment, that this statement of claim perhaps is not in the best of shape but the matter hasto be dealt with on its merits as they presently stand.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> What Mr Fung on behalf of the defendants says is this: that where one has a partnership at the core of this dispute, one is not entitledto sue in conversion in respect of partnership property because, as he submits, one is required to demonstrate an exclusive rightto possession of the particular goods which are the subject matter of the dispute and so where, as in this case, the matter is broughtagainst a background of partnership, the plaintiffs simply do not qualify as appropriate plaintiffs in an action for conversion.In those circumstances, paragraph 13 of the statement of claim is simply not maintainable.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As against that, Mr Lam who appears for the plaintiffs, says that firstly, given the high burden which is placed upon the defendantto justify a striking out, the defendants have simply not shown that the matter is so hopeless as it presently stands as to justifystriking out.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I have also had my attention drawn to a passage from Clark &amp; Lindsell On Tort, the 18th Edition, paragraph 1446, which is inthese terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A person has title to sue for conversion if and only if he had at the time of the conversion either actual possession or the immediateright to possess. It is not necessary to prove ownership and indeed even an owner may not sue unless he either possesses or has theimmediate right to possess."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Then in paragraph 1447, the following sentence appears and Mr Lam also relies on this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The right of a co-owner to sue his other co-owners is limited to cases of destruction, wrongful sale and disposal which pass goodtitle to the disponee. Secondly, where co-owners join in entrusting a chattel to a third party, no action lies for detention or refusalto return it unless all the co-owners concur in demanding its redelivery."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">[although perhaps that does not really suit the circumstances of this dispute].</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> What Mr Lam particularly relies upon is clause 6 of the agreement. The agreement in its material parts is pleaded at paragraph 4of the statement of claim. Clause 6 is in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"During the said period, if the defendants withdraw prematurely any contributed capital and any inventory will belong to the plaintiff'sunconditionally."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Although, as I pointed out to Mr Lam in the course of the argument, it does not immediately appear on the face of the statement ofclaim that the matter is put specifically on the basis of clause 6, it seems to me that Mr Lam has just about done enough to persuademe that it would be wrong to strike out the claim based as it is on paragraph 13 of the statement of claim. If only, perhaps on acharitable view of the matter, all the facts are there on the pleading and what Mr Lam submits on behalf of the plaintiffs is thatthere is sufficient material on the face of the pleading to indicate in this case that the defendants, if the plaintiffs are righton their pleaded case, having made off with the stock, acted in a way that was totally inconsistent with the basis of the agreementamounting to a premature withdrawal and consequently that would bring the partnership to an end, thereby giving the plaintiffs exclusivepossession and thereby justifying the claim for conversion under paragraph 13.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> And so, as I indicated earlier in my judgment, whilst I take the view that this is not the happiest of pleadings and it may wellrequire amendment, I cannot characterise it as being so hopeless as to justify my striking it out on the basis of Order 18, Rule19.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> So for these reasons, this summons must be dismissed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Plaintiff's costs in the cause.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Ian Carlson</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">District Court Judge</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr G Lam, instructed by Messrs C T Chan &amp; Co., for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Fung S W, of Messrs Chan, Leung &amp; Cheung, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="50%" valign="top">                    <p align="justify">I/we certify that to the best of my/our ability and skill, the forgoing is a true transcript of the audio recording of the above proceedings.</p>                    <p align="justify">...............................................<br />                    Liz Shore</p>                    <p align="justify">27 December 2000</p>                </td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2000/27.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
