These are the reasons for my decision.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The background leading to these proceedings may be summarized as follows.</p>    <p class="heading">A. BACKGROUND</p>    <p class="heading">A.1. The parties</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Apple, a US company established in January 1977, is a world renowned leader in the business of designing, manufacturing and marketingof a wide variety of innovative products including computers, iPod media players, iPhones and iPads. IP Application, an English companyincorporated in August 2009, is a special purpose company set up and used by Apple to acquire trademarks related to the name âiPadâ. They are the plaintiffs in these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The defendants come from the Proview Group.  The Proview Group is a producer of display devices.  Its major products include LCDmonitors, CRT monitors and flat-panel digital products.  It has operations and offices around the world, including Taiwan, MainlandChina (Shenzhen and Wuhan), Hong Kong and Europe.  Its holding company is Proview Holdings, which was incorporated in Bermuda andis listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Yang Long San, Rowell (âYangâ), a Taiwanese, is the founder of the Proview Group.  He was at all material times the chairmanand chief executive officer of Proview Holdings until he was adjudicated bankrupt on 2 August 2010.  Other companies of the ProviewGroup that feature in these proceedings are Proview Electronics, a Taiwan company, Proview Shenzhen and Yoke Technology, both beingShenzhen companies.  Yang was at all material times the responsible person and director of Proview Electronics.  He was also thelegal representative, general manager and chairman of both Proview Shenzhen and Yoke Technology and remains so despite his bankruptcy.</p>    <p class="heading">A.2. The disputes</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In January 2010, Apple announced its new tablet computer branded âiPadâ.  It was first launched on the US market on 3 April2010 and then in other places around the world one month later. It has since become much sought after worldwide.  As at June 2010,over 1 million units had already been sold in the US market alone.  Its success is phenomenal.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In preparation for the launch of iPads, Apple caused investigations to be conducted throughout the world to identify registeredtrademarks associated with the name âiPadâ with a view to acquiring them.  As Mr Paul Schmidt of Messrs Baker &amp; Mackenzie(âB&amp;Mâ), solicitors for Apple and IP Application explained in his second affidavit :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â17. â¦ Appleâs products are highly sought after by consumers throughout the world and the launch of every new product by Appleis eagerly awaited and the subject of much media coverage. Accordingly, in the lead up to the launch of a new product, Apple facesthe dual challenges of maintaining the confidentiality of the product (including its features and the name or trade mark under whichit will be marketed) and ensuring that upon its launch, the product can be marketed under the name or trade mark selected for it.The latter challenge is met, inter alia, by Apple securing all requisite trade mark registrations worldwide prior to the announcementand launch of the new product. However, in order to maintain confidentiality and the anonymity of Apple, this is done through specialpurpose companies incorporated for the purpose for securing such requisite trade mark registrations. Based on my 16 yearsâ experienceas a lawyer, and in particular, 7 years of experience as a trade marks lawyer, it is my experience that this practice of using specialpurpose vehicles to secure trade mark registrations in order to preserve the anonymity of a well known company and the confidentialityof its plans to launch a new product is a common practice throughout the world, and especially in mainland China.</p>        <p class="quote">18. Accordingly, in 2009, Apple carried out investigations into the use of trade marks associated with the name âiPadâ via itslawyers and agentsâ¦ in preparation for the proposed announcement and launch of its iPad branded device in early 2010.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The investigations revealed that Proview Group owned trademark registrations in eight countries or territories (âthe Subject Trademarksâ)including two trademark registrations in the Mainland, Registrations Nos. 1590557 and 1682310 (âthe China Trademarksâ).  Negotiationsbetween an agent engaged by Apple and IP Application and Proview Groupâs representatives then took place between August and December2009.  Eventually, IP Application and Proview Holdings, Proview Electronics and Proview Shenzhen (âthe Contracting Defendantsâ)entered into a written agreement in December 2009 whereby the Contracting Defendants agreed to sell, transfer and assign the SubjectTrademarks to IP Application for Â£35,000 (âthe Agreementâ).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is Apple and IP Applicationâs case that in the process of drawing up the formal written agreement (âthe Written Agreementâ)and the assignments (âthe Country Assignmentsâ) to give effect to the Agreement, the representatives of the Contracting Defendantsrepresented and led IP Application to believe that all the Subject Trademarks, including in particular the China Trademarks, wereowned by and registered in the name of Proview Electronics.  Accordingly, the Written Agreement and the Country Assignments executedon 23 December 2009 expressly stated that Proview Electronics was the proprietor of the Subject Trademarks including the China Trademarksand that Proview Electronics warranted that it was the unencumbered sole owner of the Subject Trademarks including the China Trademarks. The Country Assignment pertaining to the China Trademarks (âthe China Country Assignmentâ) also recited that Proview Electronicswas the proprietor of the China Trademarks.  However, after Apple had announced the launch of iPads in January 2010, it was discoveredthat the China Trademarks were in fact registered in the name of Proview Shenzhen.  The China Country Assignment was accordinglyineffective in assigning the China Trademarks to IP Application.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Apple and IP Application further complained that while acknowledging that a mistake had been made in the China Country Assignment,the Contracting Defendants refused to rectify the mistake and suggested that Apple should pay US$10 million to purchase the ChinaTrademarks.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 24 March 2010, Apple and IP Application, through B&amp;M, issued a letter to the Contracting Defendants demanding them to transferthe China Trademarks to them.  The Contracting Defendants refused to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">B. APPLICATIONS FOR INTERIM INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</p>    <p class="heading">B.1. Events leading to the applications</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Since early April 2010, there had been intermittent reports in the media suggesting that the Proview Group, in particular ProviewHoldings and Proview Shenzhen were about to sell or dispose of the China Trademarks.  When pressed by B&amp;M, Proview Holdings andProview Shenzhen gave an undertaking on 9 April 2010 not to sell the China Trademarks before 30 April 2010.  On 29 April 2010, ProviewShenzhen, through its solicitors, gave a further undertaking not to sell or otherwise dispose of the China Trademarks until 31 May2010 in order to facilitate further discussions for a commercial resolution of the dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Despite the second undertaking, press reports about the possibility of Proview Holdings and Proview Shenzhen selling the China Trademarkscontinued to surface.  In response to B&amp;Mâs demands, Proview Shenzhen, through its solicitors, reiterated on 12 May 2010 thatit had no intention of selling or otherwise disposing the China Trademarks until 31 May 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the meantime, the fact that the Proview Group was in financial difficulties began to emerge.  In fact, on 12 May 2010, the HongKong Stock Exchange issued a notice that trading of Proview Holdingsâ shares had been suspended. Legal proceedings had been institutedagainst Proview Holdings, Proview Shenzhen and Yang in the Mainland seeking recovery of substantial assets.  More pertinently, B&amp;Mfound out that China Minsheng Banking Corporation had obtained an asset preservation order (âAPOâ) against Proview Shenzhen andthat such asset preservation order had since March 2010 been registered with the Mainland Trade Mark Office (âTMOâ) over theChina Trademarks.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Apple and IP Application immediately commenced the present action on 20 May 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 24 May 2010, they instituted proceedings against Proview Shenzhen in the Shenzhen Intermediate Peopleâs Court and filed anapplication for APO in respect of the China Trademarks.  The application was granted on 12 June 2010 but subject to the APOs obtainedby some other Mainland banks.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Further searches revealed that contrary to its undertakings, Proview Shenzhen had in fact lodged applications with the TMO to transferthe China Trademarks to Yoke Technology on 7 May 2010.</p>    <p class="heading">B.2. Applications</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 2 June 2010, Apple and IP Application applied, <i>ex parte</i>, for interim injunctive relief against Proview Holdings, Proview Shenzhen, Yang and Yoke Technology essentially to preserve the ChinaTrademarks.  Deputy Judge Carlson allowed the application.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 3 June 2010, Apple and IP Application took out the present <i>inter parte</i> summons (âthe Summonsâ), which was returned for the first hearing before Sakhrani J on 11 June 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Proview Shenzhen and Yoke Technology were then absent.  Sakhrani J granted the interim relief sought against them until trial orfurther order.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Proview Holdings and Yang were legally represented.  After hearing arguments, Sakhrani J ordered that until the determination ofthe Summons, Proview Holdings be restrained from dealing in or with the China Trademarks and Yang be restrained from procuring, assistingor authorizing Proview Holdings, Proview Shenzhen and/or Yoke Technology to deal in the China Trademarks.  His Lordship then gavedirections for filing of evidence and adjourned the Summons for substantive hearing.</p>    <p class="heading">C. THE PRESENT HEARING</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The substantive hearing then came before me.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Yang purported to file an affirmation for and on behalf of himself and Proview Holdings on 30 July 2010.  That affirmation was affirmedoutside Hong Kong before a solicitor of Hong Kong.  It is clearly inadmissible : see <i>Top Flying Investment Ltd v Open Mission Assets Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%204%20HKLRD%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 4 HKLRD 83</a>, <i>per</i> Recorder McCoy, SC at paragraphs 30â32.  B&amp;M pointed out the deficiency to Yangâs solicitors but no attempt had been madeto rectify the defect.  Effectively, neither Proview Holdings nor Yang has placed any evidence before me.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As noted, Yang was adjudicated bankrupt on 2 August 2010.

Instead, they attempted to exploit the situation as a business opportunity for the ProviewGroup by seeking an amount of US$10,000,000 from Apple.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Yoke Technology inferentially participated in the conspiracy by acting as the transferee of the China Trademarks under the reportedtransfer applications referred to in paragraph 17 above.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Yangâs participation in the conspiracy can be inferred from among other things, the following matters :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) as the chairman and chief executive officer of Proview Holdings and the responsible person and director of Proview Electronicsand as the legal representative, general manager and chairman of both Proview Shenzhen and Yoke Technology, he had at the materialtime management and control over them; and</p>        <p>(2) he had knowledge of the Agreement entered into by the parties in December 2009.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  It is plain that the defendants had the necessary intent to injure Apple and IP Application and their conduct will cause damageto them.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is clearly a serious question to be tried for the claim of conspiracy.</p>    <p>D.2.c. The China Trademarks held on trust</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  A contract for valuable consideration to transfer a subject matter passes a beneficial interest by way of property in that subjectmatter if the contract is one of which a court of equity will decree specific performance and the vendor becomes in equity a trusteefor the purchaser of the subject matter.  See <i>Palmer v Carey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1926%5d%20AC%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1926] AC 703</a>, at pp.706â707; <i>Lewin on Trusts</i> 18<sup>th</sup> Edn, at paragraphs 10â03 to 10â10.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In performing of the Agreement, IP Application had paid Â£35,000 for the Subject Trade Marks (including the China Trademarks) on23 December 2009.  It is plainly arguable that the circumstances of the present case are such that the court may order specific performanceif IP Application succeeds in its claim for breach of contract.  There is accordingly clearly a serious question to be tried thatProview Shenzhen now holds the China Trademarks on trust for Apple and IP Application.</p>    <p>D.2.d.

Irreparable damage to Apple and IP Application</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Apple has launched and marketed its iPads worldwide, including, in particular, in Mainland China.  It is accordingly important thatit is able to secure and obtain the China Trademarks.  It can do so only if the China Trademarks are not disposed of by the defendantspending the determination of the present case.  If the defendants are not restrained and are able to dispose of the China Trademarks,they will clearly suffer irreparable damage.</p>    <p class="heading">D.4. No irreparable damage to the defendants</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On the other hand, there will be no damage or harm caused to defendants if they are restrained from not disposing of the China Trademarkspending the resolution of the dispute between the parties.</p>    <p class="heading">D.5. Balance of convenience</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  It is well established that one important factor in the balance of convenience is preservation of the <i>status quo</i>.  The grant of the injunctions sought against the defendants will serve to preserve the <i>status quo</i> pending trial without causing any real loss or damage to the defendants.  But as noted, if no interim injunctions are in place, andthe defendants are at liberty to dispose of the China Trademarks before trial, Apple and IP Application will suffer irreparable damage,even if they succeed at the end of the day.  The balance of convenience is clearly weighed heavily in favour of granting the reliefsought.</p>    <p class="heading">E.
