In short, according to the tribunal's "Reasons for Decision" dated 9 October 2003, the grounds forthe dismissal of the claim were that the claim is beyond its jurisdiction and that it lacked merits. In the revised grounds of appeal,the appellant contends that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the learned Presiding Officer erred in construing the phrase 'sum of money' [in] s. 7 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> to exclude claims for damages for breach of contract but construed the meaning as limited to claim[s] for ascertained sums".</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Jurisdictional Provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a></p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The correctness (or otherwise) of the said order turns on the true meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 7</a> and the Schedule, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>). <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 7(1)</a> provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The tribunal shall have jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine the claims specified in the Schedule".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The parts of the First Schedule relevant to this appeal provide:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A claim for <em>a sum of money</em> which arises from-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) the breach of a term, whether express or implied, of a contract of employment, whether for performance in Hong Kong or under acontract to which the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts for Employment Outside Hong Kong Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap 78</a>) applies;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">... ,</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">other than a claim specified in the Schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/453" class="autolink_findacts">Minor Employment Claims Adjudication Board Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/453">Cap 453</a>)." (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In the "Reasons for Decision", the learned Presiding Officer said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" 13. Although the Appellant in the present case attempted to quantify the amount of damages by adopting a figure [of] $77,070 soas to clothe this claim as a liquidated one, I do not accept it is a claim for a liquidated sum of money. Assuming that the Appellantwas able to prove a case of a breach of [the] trust and confidence term in a contract of employment, I would accept that on the authorityof EVELYN SEMAN BACHICHA and POON SHIU MAN HENRY (Civil Appeal No. 55 of 2000), the Appellant would be entitled to an award of damages.But the amount of damages in my judgment, will not necessarily [consist of] the total wages the Appellant would have earned fromthe remainder of her contract. In the BACHICHA case, the plaintiff was awarded damages in the total sum of $51,629 by HH Judge CB Chan of which $46,577 was awarded for breach of [the] trust and confidence term and constructive dismissal. Such amount of damageswas however reduced to $17,370 by the Court of Appeal. ... " (para. 13 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" 14. ... Given the fact that for the present claim for damages, assessment of damages is required, I failed to see how it could meetthe requirement for 'a claim for a sum of money' which had to be an ascertained sum. I therefore conclude that this Tribunal hadno jurisdiction over this remaining item of claim for damages" (para. 14 thereof).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Relevant Judicial Authorities on Jurisdiction</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The tribunal's above conclusion must have been based on the decision in <strong>National Ebauch Ltd v. Rishi Kaumar Bhatnagar</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 114</a> because that was the only authority on jurisdiction referred to by the tribunal: para. 12, "Reasons for Decision". Roberts CJ saidin that decision:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Section 7 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Labour Tribunal in relation to those claims which are specified in the Schedule tothe Ordinance. Paragraph 1 of that Schedule confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal in relation to a 'claim for a sum of money', whicharises from the breach of a term, whether expressed or implied, in the contract of employment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Is a claim for liquidated damages 'a sum of money' within the meaning of that Schedule? Paragraph 1 of the Explanatory Memorandum,which was annexed to the Labour Tribunal Bill on its publication states -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'This Bill establishes a tribunal, to be known as the Labour Tribunal, the jurisdiction of which is at present restricted to claimsin respect of liquidated sums arising out of a breach of contract of employment, though there is provision for its jurisdiction tobe changed by resolution of the Legislative Council'.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">Paragraph 3 contains a passage, which is to the same effect -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'Part III deals with the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Clause 7 confers on the tribunal the jurisdiction set out in the Schedule.This is limited to claims for money arising out of a breach of contract of employment or statutory duty'.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It seems to me that the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'a sum of money' is that it is an ascertained sum. This view, so far as the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> is concerned, is reinforced by the passages to which I have referred in the Explanatory Memorandum, which indicate that the intentionof the Legislature was to exclude claims for unliquidated damages. This seems to me to be in accordance with the general intentionof the Ordinance, which was to provide a simple informal forum without lawyers to deal with relatively simple claims which can beeasily quantified.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that a claim for a sum of money arising from a breach of contract, does not include a claimfor unliquidated damages. I thus agree with the ruling of Mr. Eric Li, the Presiding Officer in Labour Tribunal Claim No. 2352 of1979 to the same effect" (p. 115).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It is clear that, when construing <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 7</a> and the Schedule in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>, the court in <strong>National Ebauch</strong> approached the matter based on (a) the natural and ordinary meaning of the words "a sum of money", (b) external aid in the form ofthe Explanatory Memorandum annexed to the Bill (which Bill resulted in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>), and (c) a purposive (or mischief) approach.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The learned Chief Justice may not be alone in so concluding, the Full Court in <strong>Hung Sang Engineering Works Ltd v. Yu Wing Fat</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20HKLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] HKLR 394</a> decided that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is therefore the proceeding between the claimant and the defendant which may be transferred under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10</a> and we must construe the Order of transfer accordingly. But what was the proceeding between the Respondent and the Appellants whichwas transferred [from the Labour Tribunal to the District Court]? According to the Form of Claim as I have interpreted it was a proceedingfor the recovery of unliquidated damages for breach of a contract of apprenticeship limited to $338. The whole purpose of the Formof Claim was to inform the Defendant and the Court what it was that the Respondent sought. The presiding officer seems to have appreciatedthat the claim before him was limited, because we see that he said the Respondent "could claim" (not "had claimed" or "was claiming")unliquidated damages and are told he advised the Respondent to apply for legal aid in making such a claim. ... In my view the presidingofficer was right in thinking that there was no unlimited claim to unliquidated damages before him" (p. 400, per Huggins J (as hethen was)).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The above passage can be understood to mean that the Full Court considered that a claim for unlimited unliquidated damages falls outsidethe tribunal's jurisdiction and should be transferred.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> But there are other court decisions which, at least to an extent, concluded differently than <strong>National Ebauch</strong> or <strong>Hung Sang</strong> regarding this matter. It is unknown why the learned Presiding Officer did not refer to these other decisions in the "Reasons forDecision". Probably he was unaware of them.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> In point of time, the first of these decisions is the decision of Hunter J (as he then was) in <strong>Panalpina (Hong Kong ) Ltd v. Ulrich Haldemann</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 275.</a> He said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The defendant relied principally on the decision of Roberts, C.J. in [<em>National Ebauch</em>], to the effect that the tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to claims for liquidated damages and that the High Court had jurisdictionto hear claims for unliquidated damages ..." (p. 277H).</p>        <p class="quote">"In my judgment the phrase 'sum of money' must be construed in the light of the fact that practically every claim for 'breach of aterm ... of a contract' [a phrase used in the Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>] will be for damages unliquidated in law but quantified in practice.It follows, I think that the phrase must cover such claims. I agree with Roberts, C.J. that the legislature anticipated a 'quantified'claim and a claim that was 'ascertained' or ascertainable. But I regret that I cannot agree that this makes the claim one for liquidateddamages, or that it limits the tribunal's jurisdiction to such claims ... " (p. 278D-E).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The reasons given by Hunter J in support of the above conclusion were:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... Liquidated damages arise 'where the parties to a contract, as part of the agreement between them, fix the amount which is tobe paid by way of damages in the event of breach, ... as a genuine pre-estimate', per McGregor on Damages 14th edition paragraph341. It is wholly exceptional to find such a provision in a service agreement. It is equally wholly exceptional to obtain specificperformance of a service agreement. <em>It follows that practically every case involving a breach of a service agreement gives rise to a claim for unliquidated damages,</em> see <em>Yip Wan-chiu v. Magnificent Industrial Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20HKLR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] HKLR 183.</a> ...</p>        <p class="quote">But to say that damages are unliquidated is not to say that they are general in the pleading sense, or at large. With very few exceptions,e.g. loss of reputation, and more recently loss of a holiday, damages for breach of contract are not general but special, and haveto be precisely particularised and quantified. ... " (p. 277I-278C) (emphasis supplied).</p>        <p class="quote">"... This conclusion [that the tribunal's jurisdiction covers "quantified" claims] seems to me to be supported by paragraph 3 [ofthe Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>]. No claim 'founded in tort' can be for liquidated damages. It may contain a calculated or special damageselement; but the bulk is likely to be for general damages. I am much comforted to know that the same conclusion was reached by O'Connor,J. on 18th December 1979 in <em>Stewart and Others v. The Hong Kong Philharmonic Society Limited</em> H.C.Civil Action No. 3031/79. ... " (p. 278E-F).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The next decision (in time) which in effect followed <strong>Panalpina</strong> is <strong>Ying Cheong Shoe Mfy v.

O'Connor, J. there pointed out that the phrase 'sum of money' was clearly envisaged by paragraph 3 of the schedule to includea claim for unliquidated damages, for since all claims in tort are for unliquidated damages, the paragraph, in effect, concedes thata claim for a sum of money can arise in a cause of action founded in tort.</p>        <p class="quote">Mr. Smith, on behalf of the plaintiffs, submitted that Hunter, J. was clearly wrong ...

I only wish to say that it seems likely that the difficult and ambiguous phrase, "sum of money" may well have been usedto highlight the <em>distinction between any monetary claim whatsoever</em>, arising from the breach of a contract of employment, be it a claim for liquidated damages, or unliquidated damages, limited or unlimited,on the one hand, and any <em>non-monetary claim</em>, on the other ...

The issue whether the claim for general damages arisingfrom the breach of employment contract is within the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal has been considered in Labour Appeal cases.The line of authorities has been summarized by H.H. Judge Li in <em>MONES, CELESTINA SALDIVAR v. LUI SIU HUNG</em> (Labour Tribunal Appeal No. HCLA 81 OF 1999)" (para. 38 thereof).</p>        <p class="quote">" 40 ... I agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Roberts CJ as further elaborated by Hunter J. The phase "a sum of money" shouldbe interpreted as damages unliquidated in law but quantified in practice.

The learned editors said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... Damages for a breach of contract committed by the defendant are a compensation to the claimant for the damage, loss or injuryhe has suffered through that breach. He is, as far as money can do it, to be placed in the same position as if the contract had beenperformed. This implies a <em>'net loss' approach</em> in which the gains made by the claimant as the result of the breach (<em>e.g.</em> savings made because he is relieved from performing his side of a contract which has been terminated for breach ... ) must be <em>set off</em> against his losses arising from the breach (after he has taken reasonable steps to minimise those losses). <em>In assessing</em> damages for breach of contract, the court can take account of only strict, legal obligations ... If the claimant cannot establishan actual loss, he is entitled only to nominal damages. Even where the claimant can prove his loss, damages are hardly ever a fullrecompense, since ' it must be remembered that the rules as to damages can in the nature of things only be approximately just' ...": para. 27-001 (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>McGregor on Damages (2003) 17th Ed., para. 1-001 is to similar effect. It is important to bear this elementary but fundamental principlein mind in considering the true meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 7</a> and the Schedule, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> because a proper construction cannot be given to a statutory provision without having regard to the contextin which the provision was enacted.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The terms "general damages", "special damages", "liquidated damages" and "unliquidated damages" have excited generations of legalminds. In <em>Chitty</em>, the learned editors define "general and special damages" by way of pleading and evidence. Thus, they said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the distinction between general damages and special damages is mainly a matter of pleading and evidence. General damages aregiven in respect of such damage as the law presumes to result from the infringement of a legal right or duty: damage must be provedbut the claimant cannot quantify exactly any particular items in it. The main meaning of special damages is that precise amount ofpecuniary loss which the claimant can prove to have followed from the particular facts set out in his pleadings. Special damage mustbe specifically pleaded and evidence relevant to it cannot be adduced if only general damages have been pleaded, since the purposeof pleading special damages is to prevent surprise at trial by giving the defendant prior notice of any item in the claim for whicha definitive amount can be given in evidence, <em>e.g.</em> in a claim for wrongful dismissal, loss of salary during the period of notice required by the contract. A claimant who bases hisclaim on precise calculations must give the defendant access to the facts on which they are based ...

In relation to a head of claim set outin para. 19(b) above, it is important to note that the Schedule specifically distinguishes:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) "a sum of money which arises from ... the breach of a term ... of a contract of employment" (para. 1(a) of the Schedule), from</p>        <p class="quote">(2) "a sum of money which arises from ... the failure of a person to comply with the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> ...

The amount of all such sums is fixed by the provisions of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a>. Hence, these sums are "liquidated damages" as defined by <em>Chitty</em> (see para. 17 above). The Schedule must have intended by this distinction to confer jurisdiction on the tribunal to "inquire into,hear and determine" a claim for liquidated damages based on sums fixed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a> (in other words, sums fixed by statute) by wayof para. 1(b) of the Schedule. I accept, however, in certain instances, such a claim may arguably also fall within para. 1(a) thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As Hunter J observed in <strong>Panalpina</strong>, it is wholly exceptional to find a provision for agreeing and fixing a pre-estimate of damages in employment contracts. Sometimesthere are contractual provisions specifying the amount of wages in lieu of notice for terminating the employment. But it is rarefor there to be contractual provisions specifying that this will be the only damages payable. With this in mind, the conclusion reachedin <strong>National Ebauch</strong> (on which the tribunal based its decision on jurisdiction) would mean, for practical purposes, that both para. 1(a) and 1(b) of theSchedule only confer jurisdiction on the tribunal to inquire into, hear and determine liquidated damages fixed by statute. This istoo narrow a view to adopt. Further, such a view would render para. 1(a) of the Schedule to be almost superfluous.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Consideration should also be given to the use of the phrase "a sum of money" in para. 3 of the Schedule in relation to:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"a claim for a sum of money, or otherwise in respect of a cause of action, founded in tort ... ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> There is a presumption that a phrase used in different parts of the same statute should bear the same meaning. It is trite law thatboth general and special damages, as well as liquidated and unliquidated damages, are recoverable in a claim (or cause of action)founded in tort: see Hunter J's observation to similar effect in <strong>Panalpina</strong>, p. 278E-F (see above). If the conclusion reached in <strong>National Ebauch</strong> were correct, para. 3 of the Schedule would have been intended only to refer to liquidated damages founded in tort. There is no reasonwhy the legislature should intend such a result as regards claims (or causes of action) founded in tort.</p>    <p class="heading">(b) Purposive Approach / Mischief Rule</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I agree with great respect to the observation in <strong>National Ebauch</strong> that the general intention of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... was to provide a simple informal forum without lawyers to deal with relatively simple claims ... ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>But I do not see why that should mean the phrase "a sum of money" is only intended to cover "... claims which can be easily quantified"(insofar as that should mean claims for liquidated damages). On the contrary, a simple informal forum without lawyers which can dealwith all types of monetary claims related to contractual disputes about employment will better serve such general intention thana forum which can only deal with claims for liquidated sums. This is because tribunal proceedings tend to be faster, shorter andcheaper than those in the higher courts.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Further, defining "a sum of money" to also include unliquidated damages does not mean that the tribunal is bound to hear and determinesuch claims. In appropriate cases, the tribunal still has the power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> to decline jurisdiction and to transfer claims to the higher courts.</p>    <p class="heading">(c) Other Statutory Provisions</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Para. 6 of the Schedule, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> confers jurisdiction on the tribunal:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...to hear and determine a claim transferred to the tribunal under ... <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap 338</a>)".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 5(1)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a> provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims specified in the Schedule".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Schedule to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a> uses the phrase "monetary claim" rather than "a claim for a sum of money". It is generally accepted, becauseof the use of that phrase, that the Small Claims Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine claims for both liquidated and unliquidateddamages. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a> was enacted in 1975 (and came into effect on 1 October 1976). On the other hand, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> was enacted in 1972 (andcame into effect on 1 March 1973). Because <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> was enacted before <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>, it is unknown if the legislature intended the phrase"a claim for a sum of money" (in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>) to bear a different meaning than the phrase "monetary claim" (in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap. 338</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> To adopt the court's remark in <strong>National Ebauch</strong> regarding the general intention of the statute, like the tribunal, the Small Claims Tribunal must have been intended to be a simpleinformal forum without lawyers to deal with relatively simple claims. If the legislature should intend that the Small Claims Tribunalcan hear and determine claims for both liquidated and unliquidated damages, I cannot see any valid reason for concluding that thelegislature should intend that the tribunal cannot inquire into, hear and determine such claims.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In addition, the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal to transfer claims is founded on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 7:</a>-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The tribunal may at any stage of proceedings in the tribunal, either of its own motion or upon the application of any party, transferthe proceedings to ... the Labour Tribunal ... , whereupon the practice and procedure of ... the Labour Tribunal ... shall apply",</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 10(1):</a>-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where any counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim in proceedings in the tribunal is a <em>monetary claim</em> which is not within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, the tribunal shall order that the proceedings on the counterclaim or set-offand counterclaim be transferred to ... the Labour Tribunal ...

For this reason, there is no obscurity which would make resort to extrinsic material permissible in accordance with the principleslaid down in <strong>Pepper v. Hart</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 593</a> (the <strong>Pepper</strong> case has been applied in quite a number of Court of Final Appeal decisions).</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> But assuming somehow that resort can be had to the Explanatory Memorandum, I still do not consider this can help resolve any obscurityregarding the meaning of "a sum of money". This is because there is ambiguity in the Explanatory Memorandum itself. The court in<strong>National Ebauch</strong> referred to two paragraphs of the Explanatory Memorandum. Para. 1 reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This Bill establishes a tribunal, to be known as the Labour Tribunal, the jurisdiction of which is at present restricted to claimsin respect of <em>liquidated sums</em> arising out of a breach of contract of employment, though there is provision for its jurisdiction to be changed by resolution ofthe Legislative Council" (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The phrase "liquidated sums" can be taken to mean "liquidated damages" (in contrast to "unliquidated damages") and, if so understood,is supportive of the conclusion reached in <strong>National Ebauch</strong>. However, para. 3 thereof reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Part III deals with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Clause 7 confers on the Tribunal the jurisdiction set out in the Schedule.This is limited to <em>claims for money</em> arising out of a breach of contract of employment or statutory duty" (emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The phrase "claims for money" should have the same meaning as the phrase "monetary claims".</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I therefore disagree with the observation in <strong>National Ebauch</strong> that the Explanatory Memorandum can assist the court in ascertaining the true meaning of the phrase "a sum of money" in the Schedule,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a>. This ambiguity would mean that there has not been any clear statement by a minister or other promotor of the bill to helpresolve an obscurity in the statute: <strong>Pepper v.

It is not abundantly clear if Hunter J in <strong>Panalpina</strong> has decided that a claim for general damage could also fall within the tribunal's jurisdiction.

The nature of their claim was summarised by Lord Steyn (at p 43) as follows: -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">The claim was for damages for pecuniary loss allegedly caused by the bank's breach of an implied contractual obligation of <em>mutual trust and confidence</em>.

The conduct must, of course, impinge on the relationship in the sense that, looked at objectively, it is <em>likely to destroy or seriously damage the degree of trust and confidence</em> the employee is reasonably entitled to have in his employer. That requires one to <em>look at all the circumstances</em>.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>As Lord Steyn put it (at p 46): -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">... the implied obligation as formulated is apt to cover the great diversity of situations in which a balance has to be struck betweenan employer's interest in managing his business as he sees fit and the employee's interest in not being unfairly and improperly exploited.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">...

If the employer commits a breach of the term, and in consequence the contract comes to an end prematurely, the employeeloses the benefits he should have received had the contract run its course until it expired or was duly terminated. In addition tofinancial benefits such as salary and commission and pension rights, the losses caused by the premature termination of the contractmay include other promised benefits ... <em>Exceptionally</em>, however, the losses suffered by an employee as a result of a <em>breach of the trust and confidence term</em> may not consist of, or be confined to, loss of pay and other premature termination losses. Leaving aside injured feelings and anxiety,which are not the basis of the claim in the present case, an employee may find himself <em>worse off financially than when he entered into</em> the contract. The most obvious example is conduct, in breach of the trust and confidence term, which prejudicially affects an employee'sfuture employment prospects. The conduct may diminish the employee's attractiveness to future employers.' ...
