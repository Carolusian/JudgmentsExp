The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (âD1â) was the principal contractor of the site.  Kin Wo Form Mould Engineering was a sub-contractor of D1 doing formboardwork at the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (âD2â) was another sub-contractor of D1 doing steel binding works at the site.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant (âD3â) was employed by D2 working as a steel binding worker.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> At about 9 a.m. in the morning of 12 April 2000 the plaintiff was injured in an accident whilst working at the site.  The plaintiffwas working on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor concrete slab of the building.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> There was erected on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor concrete slab of the building an iron tubular scaffold (âthe scaffoldâ) to place reinforcement iron bars there.   A towercrane (âthe craneâ) with an operator was provided at the site by D1 for the use of sub-contractors that required materials tobe lifted from one part of the site to another. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> At the material time on 12 April 2000 Yip Man Kin (âYipâ) was the crane operator employed by D1 at the site.  Shortly beforethe accident he operated the crane to lift a bundle of iron bars and lowered these into the scaffold which was on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.  D3 was the worker who was bundling the iron bars together which he hooked onto the chains of the crane for the lifting operation. D3 released the hooks after the iron bars were placed inside the scaffold.  As the chains of the crane were being lifted up by Yipthe scaffold toppled.  The scaffold fell with the iron bars and the plaintiff was struck at his right leg.  The plaintiff sustaineda serious right ankle injury as a result of the accident.  One of the plaintiffâs female co-workers was also injured.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> At the commencement of the trial the plaintiff settled his claims against D1, D2 and D3.  An order was made by consent on 4 October2007 that there be judgment for the plaintiff against D1, D2 and D3 in the sum of $3,444,426 (inclusive of pre-trial interest) andcosts to be taxed if not agreed.  It was also ordered that the plaintiff would give credit for the sum of $644,426 received as employeeâscompensation.  The balance judgment sum of $2,800,000 was to be paid to the Director of Legal Aid on behalf of the plaintiff within21 days.  The plaintiffâs own costs was to be taxed in accordance with <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a></i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The remaining issue left to be determined was the apportionment of liability between D1, D2 and D3.  It is common ground that apportionmentof liability should be between D1 on the one hand and between D2 and D3 on the other hand.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I heard evidence from the plaintiff.  I also heard evidence from the crane operator Yip as well as from Mak Man Yan (âMakâ),D1âs site assistant supervisor at the time, and from Chan Hei Ching who provided safety consultancy services to D1.  Cheung KaiWoon (âCheungâ) a site supervisor employed by D2 also gave evidence before me.  However, D3 who had made a witness statementand who was present in Court during the trial did not give evidence before me.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of the plaintiff and Yip whom I found to be truthful and reliable witnesses.  I alsoaccept the evidence of Mak and Chan Hei Ching save that where Mak gave evidence to the effect that at the material time D1 did notoffer safety induction courses to workers at the site, I prefer the evidence of Chan Hei Ching to that of Mak.  I think Mak musthave been mistaken as to this.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> I have no hesitation in rejecting the evidence of Cheung as to what happened at the time of the accident.  He was not a crediblewitness.  He was discredited in cross-examination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Apart from the witnesses who gave evidence, D1 also relied on admissions made by D3 in his declaration to Ng Yuk Bun, the OccupationalSafety Officer of the Labour Department, made on the same day of the accident as well as admissions made by D3 in his evidence inJanuary 2001 at the San Po Kong Magistrateâs Court in the unsuccessful prosecution against D1.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Lin, for D1, submitted that liability should be apportioned as to 20% on the part of D1 and 80% on the part of D2 and D3.  MrHung, for D2 and D3, submitted that liability should be apportioned as to 30% on the part of D2 and D3 and 70% on the part of D1.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> There is no dispute that the scaffold toppled with the iron bars which struck the plaintiff causing him a serious right ankle injury. He suffered a bimalleolar fracture at the right ankle i.e. a fracture at the distal fibular and fracture at the medial malleolusof the right ankle.  He was operated on after admission to hospital for open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture withplate and screws.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> It is necessary to consider why the scaffold toppled with the iron bars which struck the plaintiff causing him a serious right ankleinjury.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On the evidence of the plaintiff, which I unhesitatingly accept, I find that at around 8 a.m. on the morning of the accident theplaintiff was working with two female co-workers and another male co-worker on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the site.  The plaintiff was responsible for taking over the wooden boards from the floor below.  At the time of the accidenthe was squatting down with his back to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and he was facing the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor waiting for the wooden boards to be delivered from the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor.  Before the accident there was no work carried out by the crane and no one gave any warning to him that work was going tobe carried out with the crane.  After the accident, apart from his co-workers there the plaintiff saw only one iron bar worker thereon the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.  This must have been D3.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiff said and I accept that when he joined the site as a worker about 9 days before the accident no one told him that whenthere was to be a lifting operation he had to stay away from that area.  Also, on the day of the accident no one warned him thatthere would be lifting work and that he should stay away from that area.  He had, as all construction workers were required to, attendeda general safety course and had obtained what has been referred to as a green card.  He was adamant that no internal safety trainingcourse was provided to him when working at the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The crane and crane operator was provided by D1 at the site.  As Yip said, and as I accept, in or around April 2000 there were approximately4 sub-contracting projects being carried out at the site including formwork and steel binding.  Each of the sub-contractors had workerson the site and each of the sub-contractors could use the crane lifting services provided by D1.  However, in the 3 days before andafter the accident Yip was mainly helping D2 lift iron bars mostly with the assistance of D3.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> On the evidence of Yip, which I also unhesitatingly accept, I find that he was the crane operator on the morning of the accidentand his task was to use the crane to place iron bars in the scaffold on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.  As he was working at a height he had to rely on the signaller who was D3 at the material time.  D3 was responsible for hookingthe bundle of iron bars to the chains of the crane and for releasing the hooks after the iron bars had been placed inside the scaffold. I also find that after the hooks were released the chains of the crane were lifted up slowly by Yip after D3 using his walkie-talkiehad told him to lift up the slings.  The crane was engaged in 2<sup>nd</sup> gear when lifting the chains and Yip estimated the speed of 2<sup>nd</sup> gear to be about one foot per second which is a slow speed.  He denied that he was lifting the slings at a fast speed.  I believehim.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Yip said that after a short while he heard D3 telling him over the walkie-talkie to stop the crane which he immediately did.  Afterthat he realized that the hooks of the crane struck the scaffold causing it to topple with the iron bars falling out and injuringtwo workers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> There can, in my view, be no doubt that D3 should have held both chains of the crane after releasing the hooks when the iron barswere placed in the scaffold.  The proper and safe procedure for the signaller was to hold the slings and hooks with his hands untilthey are raised to a height above his head to which he can no longer reach and then to let go of the slings and hooks in the liftingprocess.  As Chan Hei Ching said, which I accept, throughout the process the signaller should be cautious and focused to ensure thatthe slings and hooks do not come into contact with any object while they are being raised.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> That D3 knew of the proper and safe procedure to be adopted is clear from the evidence of Chan Hei Ching whose evidence I accept. Chan Hei Ching was the one who organized safety induction courses for the siteâs workers and he confirmed that D3 did attend safetytraining courses which he had conducted at the site as well as site safety meetings.  Although Mak said that D1 did not at the timeof the accident offer safety induction courses to workers, I think he must have been mistaken as to this.  I prefer the evidenceof Chan Hei Ching on this.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> D3 has also admitted that he attended training courses.  The plaintiff was not asked to attend safety induction courses before hestarted work at the site but, in my view, D1 should have ensured that all workers attend the safety induction course before commencingwork on the site. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> D3 admitted in his declaration to Ng Yuk Bun that he had built the scaffold at around 8 a.m. on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the site.  At around 9 a.m. the crane lifted a bundle of approximately 14 pieces of Y32 iron bars with the crane to thescaffold.  He also admitted that when the iron bars were placed in the scaffold he started to untie the bundle at both ends and askedthe crane operator to lift up the slings slowly.  He admitted that the hooks at the end of the chain got entangled with the crossbraces of the scaffold causing the scaffold and the iron bars to fall down and striking the plaintiff and the other female co-worker. He knew that they were working in the vicinity at the time.  He also admitted that the slings were hanging in the air when beinglifted up.  It is clear that he admitted that the crane operator was lifting the slings at a slow speed and the slings were lefthanging in the air.  It is obvious that he did not hold the slings with his hands to a height above his head before releasing thesame in the lifting process as he should have done.  He also admitted that he did not inform the other workers there that the craningoperation was going on and that he did not warn them of the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The declaration made by D3 was made on the same day of the accident and the admissions against the interests of D2 and D3 containedtherein should, in my view, be given great weight.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> D3 also made admissions when giving evidence in the said magistrateâs court which should also, in my view, be given great weight.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> D3 admitted that after he had asked the crane operator to lift up the slings he was busy doing something else.  He admitted thatthe chain was lifted up slowly and the chain was wound around the scaffold and when the chain was pulled up the scaffold leaned andcollapsed with the iron bars dropping on the floor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> D3 also admitted that he had attended safety training courses and that the normal procedure during the lifting process was for himto hold the chains while they were lifted up slowly until a height that he could no longer reach.  He also admitted that Chan HeiChing had verified the safe procedure for lifting work with him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Cheung gave evidence that at the time of the accident he was also on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor supervising D3.  He said that after the iron bars were unloaded into the scaffold D3 unlocked the hooks of the chains.  Hesaid that D3 held one chain, not both chains, of the crane.  The other chain was on the other side of the scaffold and D3 guidedthe one he was holding to the one that was hanging in the air on the other side and brought them together.  He said that D3 askedthe crane operator to lift the slings up.  He said that he could hear what D3 said and he was sure that the exact words used by D3were âoperator, please raise the metal hook slowlyâ.  Cheung said that he heard a voice from D3âs walkie-talkie to the effectthat the crane operator was told to hurry up with the lifting and to turn the crane to the right side to lift something else.  Afterhearing that he said that the crane swung quickly to the right and the hook of the chain hit against the scaffold causing it to fallwith the iron bars.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Cheung also said that he did not see the plaintiff or the other co-workers before the accident.  He only saw the plaintiff and theother injured co-worker after the accident.  He also said that he did not go over to offer help to the injured persons.  He saidthat he did not know that persons had been injured.  He even went so far as to say that they were still standing after the accident. This is not credible.  It is highly unlikely that the plaintiff who had sustained a serious ankle injury would be able to standafter the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> I have grave doubts as to whether D2 was even there at the time of the accident.  He never gave a statement to Ng Yuk Bun who arrivedat the scene at about 10 a.m. which was very soon after the accident.  Although Cheung said that he did inform his boss at aroundnoon that he had witnessed the accident, no statement was taken from him by anyone.  His witness statement was only made on 15 November2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Cheung also contradicted parts of his first witness statement made on 15 November 2004.  He was unable to satisfactorily explainwhy he had said in his first witness statement at paragraph 12 that he had seen the plaintiff enter the area on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and that he had yelled at him to leave warning him of the danger when in his evidence in Court he said that he did not seethe plaintiff before the accident.  He was also unable to satisfactorily explain why at paragraph 12 of his first witness statementhe said that he could not hear D3âs conversation with the crane operator when in evidence he was sure of the exact words used byD3 which he heard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I have no hesitation in rejecting Cheungâs evidence.  His evidence is contradicted by Yipâs evidence and the admissions of D3. Where the evidence of Cheung is at variance with the evidence of Yip and the plaintiff, I have no hesitation in preferring theirevidence to that of Cheung whose evidence I reject.  He was neither a credible nor reliable witness.  I have no hesitation in rejectinghis evidence as to what happened at the time of the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> It is clear that as D3 has without explanation not been called to give evidence at the trial before me even though he had made awitness statement and was clearly available to give evidence as he was present in Court during the trial, an adverse inference shouldbe drawn against D2 and D3 (<i>Li Sau Keung v Maxcredit Engineering Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20HKC%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 HKC 434).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I find that the accident was caused because D3 failed to hold the slings with his hands while the lifting process was being carriedout.  He should, as he well knew, have held the slings up to the height that he could reach before releasing the slings.  Becausehe did not hold the slings, the slings were left hanging in the air and the chain or chains got entangled with the cross braces ofthe scaffold while the crane operator was lifting the slings up slowly.  This caused the scaffold to topple and the scaffold andiron bars fell onto the ground which struck the plaintiff at his right ankle causing him the serious ankle injury.  D3 also failedto warn the plaintiff and the other co-workers to stay away from the vicinity of the lifting operation before carrying out the liftingoperation.  They were only about 2.2 m away from the scaffold at the time as found by Ng Yuk Bun in his investigations as set outin the Accident Report.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In my judgment the main cause of the accident was the result of the negligence of D3 for which D2 is also vicariously liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> D2 is also liable in negligence in failing to ensure that the lifting operation was carried out safely and to safeguard other workerson the site who may be endangered by the lifting operation.  Thus, D2 is also primarily liable apart from being vicariously liablefor D3âs negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> It is not disputed that D1 is also liable for the accident and the injuries to the plaintiff.  It seems to me that D1 as the principalcontractor of the site had control of the site.  D1 provided the crane and the operator which was available for the use of the sub-contractorsat the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Lin submitted that on the evidence reasonable steps were taken by D1 to discharge its duty of care.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I accept that D1 did provide safety induction courses and there were also site safety meetings at the site.  There were also inspectionsat the site conducted by Chan Hei Ching and the other people he mentioned including Mak.  However, it is clear that D1 did not havea site safety officer on the site at all times when work was being carried out.  Chan Hei Ching patrolled the site twice a week inaddition to the inspections by the other persons.  At the time of the lifting operations, however, D1 did not provide a supervisorto supervise the lifting operation to ensure that the lifting was done safely and to avoid any danger to other workers like the plaintiff. There was only one crane at the site so there would only be one lifting operation at a time.  As this was obviously a dangerousoperation in the site where workers were present, it would have been reasonable, in my view, for D1 to provide a supervisor to overseethe lifting operation.  By failing to do so D1, in my view, failed to provide and maintain a safe and proper place or system of work.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> D1 is also liable, in my view, for breach of statutory duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> I find that the injuries to the plaintiff were also caused by the breach of statutory duty on the part of D1.

Hallett J, on the other hand, declinedto follow this interpretation, and it is now well-established that neither element should be disregarded.  For example, in <i>Downs v Chappell</i> a negligent defendant was required to contribute equally with a fraudulent defendant on the basis that the negligence had a greatercausative impact.  Hobhouse LJ said that: âIt is just and equitable to take into account both the seriousness of the respectivepartiesâ faults and their causative relevance.  A more serious fault having less causative impact on the plaintiffâs damage mayrepresent an equivalent responsibility to a less serious fault which had a greater causative impact.â  </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">144.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">The apportionment of damages is substantially a matter of discretion.
