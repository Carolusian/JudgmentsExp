On 29 July2010, ONCL gave a substantive reply as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) BCL never received any notice of the Accident, and only knew about it upon receipt of RLCâs letter dated 8 July 2010 (see theabove paragraph) on 12 July 2010;</p>        <p>(b) since the Accident occurred in March 2007, BLC had ceased business since 31 July 2009 and most of BLCâs documents had been lost,BLC had great difficulty in investigating further about the Accident and the Plaintiffâs alleged claim;</p>        <p>(c) since about April 2005 BLC and the Defendant had an agreement for the supply of labour for pick and pack service at the Warehouseas evidenced by BLCâs quotation to the Defendant dated 26 January 2005 (â<u>BLC Quotation</u>â), which quotation was accepted/signed by the Defendant and which provides for HK$30.00/manhour <i>per</i> worker, but BLC could no longer locate such signed acceptance;</p>        <p>(d) BLC only supplied casual workers (whose salaries were paid in cash and recorded in BLCâs petty cash voucher) to the Defendant;</p>        <p>(e) BLC could only locate a standard form employment agreement which would be signed by its casual workers (â<u>Employment Agreement</u>â) and which provides that âæ¬äººâ¦â¦çº[BLC]è¨æåç´å¡å·¥ï¼æéç±__å¹´__æ__æ¥è³__å¹´__æ__æ¥ï¼å·¥è³ä»¥æ¥èª/æèªæ¯å¤©è¨ç®åç¼æ¾ãéæ¹æ¼ä¸è¿°æéå§å¦æéè¦çµæ­¢/åæ¶èç´åæ­¤åè­°ï¼å¯æ¼ä¸å¤©åå£é ­éç¥å°æ¹å³å¯ï¼ç¡éä»»ä½è³ åæè£åâ,but BLC could no longer find any such signed agreements;</p>        <p>(f) é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) was employed by the Defendant as a casual worker and assigned to perform pick andpack service at the Warehouse;</p>        <p>(g) BLCâs invoice dated 31 March 2007 to the Defendant (â<u>BLC Invoice</u>â) states <i>inter alia</i> that 8 casual workers were supplied to the Defendant to perform pick and pack service, and BLCâs petty cash voucher dated 12 March2007 (â<u>BLC Voucher</u>â) shows that é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) was one of BLCâs casual workers assigned to work at the Warehousefrom 5 to 9 March 2007;</p>        <p>(h) BLC did not know whether âAh Chingâ was one of the 8 casual workers supplied to the Defendant and could not confirm whetherâAh Chingâ is Wong Suk Ching who was allegedly involved in the Accident since the BLC Voucher reveals that 2 out of the 8 workersBLC supplied to the Defendant on 8 March 2007 (ieé»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) and é¦®ç´ è² (transliteration ofFung So Ching)) have the character è² (transliteration of Ching) in their names.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>ONCL confirmed they had made enquiries with the Defendant, and further urged the Plaintiff to withhold action pending further investigation.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 29 July 2009, ONCL wrote to the Defendant claiming that BLC had great difficulty in investigating the alleged Accident and thePlaintiffâs claim, and asking <i>inter alia</i> for copies of the Form 2, any accident investigation report prepared by and any witness statements taken by the Defendant, its lossadjuster and/or the Labour Department, and any colour photographs of the Scene.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On 30 July 2010, RLC informed ONCL they would apply to join BLC as a party to the present proceedings in order to protect the Plaintiffâsposition. Indeed, the Summons was issued on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On 12 August 2010, ONCL asked RLC for (a) documentary evidence in support of the alleged circumstances of the Accident such as statements,notice of accident, accident investigation report and colour photographs of the Scene, (b) confirmation as to whether the LabourDepartment had investigated the alleged Accident, (c) copies of any witness statements and accident report, and (d) pleadings filedin the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On the same day, ONCL chased the Defendant and LL for a reply to their letter of 29 July 2010 (see paragraph 25 above).  On 20 August2010, ONCL again chased LL for a reply and for further confirmation that (a) the Plaintiff only claimed âAh Chingâ was involvedin the alleged Accident for the first time in the Statement of Claim, (b) such allegation could not be found elsewhere in the pleadings,witness statements (if any) and documents relevant to the EC Action and/or the present proceedings, and (c) prior to the serviceof the Defence the Defendant and LL never received enquiries from the Plaintiff about the identity of the person who allegedly pushed/pulledthe trolley/cart that hit the Plaintiff, the full name of âAh Chingâ, the identity of the employer of âAh Chingâ and howthe Defendant could identify âAh Chingâ as Wong Suk Ching with supporting documents if any.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  On 24 August 2010, RLC asked ONCL for the addresses of both é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) and é¦®ç´ è² (transliterationof Fung So Ching).

ISSUES</i></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The relevant issues are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) whether the Plaintiffâs claim against BLC has been time-barred under the primary limitation period in section 27(4)(a);</p>        <p>(b) whether such claim has been time-barred under the secondary limitation period in section 27(4)(b);</p>        <p>(c) if the primary or secondary limitation period has not yet expired, whether BLC should be joined as a further defendant in thepresent proceedings under Order 15 rule 6(2)(b) of the Rules of the High Court (â<u>RHC</u>â);</p>        <p>(d) if the primary and secondary limitation periods have expired, whether section 27 should be disapplied pursuant to section 30.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In respect of (b) in the above paragraph, it is common ground that the date when the Plaintiff first had actual knowledge of thematters set out in section 27(6) was within the three-year period prior to the issue of the Summons.  But there is a sub-issue asto whether the Plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge of the matters set out in section 27(6) from factsobservable or ascertainable by him (if necessary with expert help) within or earlier than the three-year period prior to the issueof the Summons in accordance with section 27(8).</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In respect of (c) in paragraph 37 above, Law/BLC raises the following sub-issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) whether the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is bound to fail in that there is no viable and/or believable factual basis forsuch claim;</p>        <p>(b) whether the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is inherently defective on the basis that the âworker in questionâ workedunder the direction, supervision and/or control of the Defendant and Law/BLC did not retain any such direction, supervision and/orcontrol.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Unless otherwise stated, references to âsectionsâ in this decision are references to sections in the Ordinance.  Both Mr Lau,counsel for the Plaintiff, and Mr Ho, counsel for Law/BLC, have no quarrel with the legal principles set out in my decision in <i>Cheung Yin Heung v Hang Lung Real Estate Agency Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%203%20HKLRD%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] 3 HKLRD 67.</a>  In the circumstances, I rely on but shall not repeat those legal principles in this decision.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Counsel also agree that discussions concerning paragraphs 37(b) and 38 above are premised on the assumption that the Plaintiff hasa viable claim against Law/BLC (â<u>Assumption</u>â), which is without prejudice to the Defendantâs arguments as set out in paragraph 39 above.  Before I turn to such arguments,it is convenient to dispose of the following three matters shortly.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  First, Mr Ho in his supplemental written submissions suggests that the Plaintiffâs cause of action against Law/BLC as pleadedin the draft Amended Indorsement of Claim annexed to the Summons is time-barred in the absence of any averment of âconstructiveknowledgeâ under section 27(8), so the Plaintiff is not entitled to argue in favour of any âconstructive knowledgeâ for thepurpose of the Summons without a properly pleaded case. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  I reject the suggestion that any âconstructive knowledgeâ has to be specifically pleaded in the draft Amended Indorsement ofClaim.  Normally, it is for a defendant to specifically raise any limitation defence, so a plaintiff does not have to anticipatesuch defence by pleading facts which are not yet material. In any event, the issue of âconstructive knowledgeâ will be decidedunder the Summons (see paragraphs 37(b) and 38 above), so if I grant leave for Law/BLC to be joined as a further defendant, thereis no need for the Plaintiff to plead any âconstructive knowledgeâ in any (to be amended) originating process or pleading.  Afterall, upon the determination of the limitation issue, such fact will no longer be material.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Secondly, Mr Ho in his supplemental written submissions argues that since the margin note in the Summons refers to Order 15 rule6(5) of RHC the Plaintiffâs application to join Law/BLC as a further defendant is necessarily premised on the expiry of the relevantlimitation period.  But such argument ignores the primary relief expressly sought in the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph of the Summons for joinder of Law/BLC as a further defendant in the present proceedings âon the basis that the relevantlimitation period has not expiredâ.  Further, the courtâs power to join a new party within the limitation period is governedby Order 15 rule 6(2)(b) of the RHC, and such power is exercisable by the court âeither on its own motion or by applicationâ. In the end, Mr Ho confirms he will not take such procedural point.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Thirdly, Mr Ho submits that the Plaintiffâs proposed amendments to the pleadings are defective since they fail to set out a viableclaim against Law/BLC.  However, both counsel agree that the nub of the present application is whether Law/BLC should be joined asa further defendant, and if I were to grant leave to join Law/BLC as a further defendant in the present proceedings, they furtheragree that leave should be granted to amend the Writ of Summons as <i>per</i> the draft Amended Writ of Summons annexed to the Summons, but any application to amend the Statement of Claim and/or the Defenceshould be adjourned until the Plaintiff is able to produce a draft of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim for consideration bythe other parties.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VIII. PRIMARY LIMITATION PERIOD</i></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  There is no dispute that the primary limitation period under section 27(4)(a) expired on 7 March 2010, ie three years from the dateon which the cause of action accrued (which is the date of the Accident).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>IX. SECONDARY LIMITATION PERIOD</i></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The secondary limitation period under section 27(4)(b) allows a period of three years from the date of the plaintiffâs knowledge(if later than the date of accrual of cause of action) of the matters specified in section 27(6), ie (a) that his injury was significant,(b) that it was attributable to an act or omission alleged to constitute negligence, (c) of the identity of the defendant, and (d)where the act or omission was of someone other than the defendant, the identity of that person and the factual basis upon which thedefendant is vicariously liable.  Such knowledge can be actual knowledge or constructive/imputed knowledge under section 27(8).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(a)</i> <i>Actual knowledge</i></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  As explained in paragraph 38 above, it is common ground that the Plaintiff did not acquire the requisite actual knowledge untila point in time within the three-year period immediately preceding the issue of the Summons (ie after 30 July 2007).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(b) Constructive knowledge</i></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  According to section 27(8), a plaintiffâs knowledge includes knowledge he may reasonably be expected to acquire from (a) factsobservable or ascertainable by him or (b) facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonablefor him to seek, but he shall not be fixed with knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long ashe has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.  In ascertaining whether the plaintiffknows with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the making of a claim (such as submitting a claim tothe proposed defendant, taking legal and other advice, and collecting evidence), or on the issue of a writ of summons, each casemust turn on its own facts.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The burden is on Law/BLC to show constructive knowledge on the part of the Plaintiff by a date earlier than the three-year periodprior to the issue of the Summons, ie by a date on or earlier than 30 July 2007.  The relevant test is an objective one that requiresthe court to consider the objective situation in which the Plaintiff finds himself in, including the effects of his injury but excludingthe personal characteristics individual to him, and then go on to consider when a person in such circumstances with comparable levelof injury/disability might reasonably be expected to investigate (if necessary with expert help) and acquire knowledge of the mattersset out in section 27(6) including, say, the identity of the âdefendantâ (ie Law/BLC), the identity of the relevant tortfeasor(ie âAh Chingâ), and the factual basis upon which the âdefendantâ (ie Law/BLC) is vicariously liable.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that since 3 April 2006 he was employed by the Defendant as a storeman, and his duties included loading andunloading the Goods from shelves at different locations within the Warehouse to pick and pack such products for delivery or adaptation. Apart from manual handling of the Goods, he also used fork-lift truck or trolley to unload or deliver the Goods to different unitsat the Warehouse.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In his affirmation, the Plaintiff claims that on 8 March 2007 whilst lifting the Carton at the Warehouse he was suddenly knockeddown from behind by a moving object âwhich seemed to [him] to be a trolley/cart or forklift truckâ. He lost his balance and fellbackwards to the ground with the Carton falling on his chest.  He was dizzy and in pain as he lied on the ground, and about 30 secondslater a few workers came to help him up to sit on a nearby chair.  He was subsequently taken by ambulance to PMHâs AED.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  According to the Plaintiffâs affirmation, at the time of the Accident he did not know what or who hit him that caused him to fall. It was only until about November 2009 that he heard some colleagues said he was knocked down by a trolley or fork-lift truck.  Heâcontinuously made enquiries with other colleagues who might have known the cause of [his] fall and the identity of the workerwho hit or knocked [him] downâ.  In/about February 2010, he was finally able to locate his ex-colleagues Mr Hung Ka Man (â<u>Hung</u>â) and Mr Leung Chi Hung (â<u>Leung</u>â) who told him that they saw a female worker called âAh Chingâ hurriedly pushing a trolley away from the Scene immediatelyafter he was knocked down.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The Plaintiff further claims that throughout the EC Action and in the present proceedings up to the service of the Defence on 23June 2010, neither the Defendant nor LL mentioned about BLC or any servant/agent of any independent contractor who worked at theWarehouse.  The Defendant alleged for the first time in the Defence that âAh Chingâ whose full name is Wong Suk Ching was atall material times an employee and/or servant of BLC (ie the Defendantâs independent contractor that provided pick and pack serviceat the Warehouse).</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr Ho casts doubt on the Plaintiffâs above explanations.  He argues that the lack of evidence on specific investigative stepstaken by the Plaintiff between March 2007 and November 2009 undermines the Plaintiffâs assertion that he has made enquires as toâhow he was being hit from behindâ.  Mr Ho also questions why the Plaintiff made enquiries with colleagues and not with his employerespecially when the former enquiries led nowhere.  Mr Ho says it is even more bizarre that the Plaintiff would suddenly hear fromex-colleagues in November 2009 that he was hit or knocked down by a trolley or fork-lift truck.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Mr Ho further submits that even on the Plaintiffâs own case, he should have made enquiries with his employer and colleagues shortlyafter the Accident on how the Accident happened, and the Defendant in turn would have made enquires with BLC, so that in the normalcourse of events, the Plaintiff would reasonably have been expected to find out from the Defendant about BLCâs involvement probablywithin a month after the Accident.  Mr Ho argues that the Plaintiffâs cause of action against Law/BLC has been time-barred.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In my view, the underlying premise to such argument appears to be this: had the Plaintiff made enquiries with the Defendant muchearlier he would have been able to ascertain the identity of the relevant tortfeasor who committed the alleged negligent act or omission(ie âAh Chingâ), the identity of the âdefendantâ (ie Law/BLC) and/or the factual basis upon which the âdefendantâ isvicariously liable (ie âAh Chingâ being Wong Suk Ching and an employee and/or servant of the Defendantâs independent contractorBLC that provided pick and pack service at the Warehouse).</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  But the Plaintiff was only required to act reasonably in using information he had and in obtaining information he could get to establishknowledge of the above matters.  It is therefore necessary to address a more fundamental issue first, ie whether the identity ofLaw/BLC and/or whether the factual basis upon which she is said to be vicariously liable are knowledge that the Plaintiff âmightreasonably be expected to acquireâ from facts observable or ascertainable by him.  To answer this question, one has to considerthe position at the material time and not from hindsight.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  As H H Judge Mimmie Chan observed in <i>Chan Ngan Fa v Cui You Jun</i> DCPI832/2007 (unreported, 2 March 2009),</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ the court only expects a person to take reasonable action to acquire knowledge from facts reasonably ascertainable by him.It is reasonable to expect that the action to be taken by a person intending to commence litigation would be proportionate. â¦â¦defendants or prospective defendants cannot be expected to readily assist a prospective plaintiff in pursuing his/her claim, andto volunteer information or evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Applying such principle to the present facts, Mr Hoâs submissions cannot stand if there were no observable or ascertainable factsthat would reasonably suggest to the Plaintiff the probable existence of another party apart from the Defendant so as to triggercuriosity to make enquiries.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The Plaintiff in his affirmation claims that the Warehouse was an international distribution centre occupying more than 150,000sq ft of space and providing logistics service for the export of the Goods within the Asia Pacific operation division of the Defendantâsgroup of companies with the support of around 100 employees. In the 1<sup>st</sup> FBP Answer, the Defendant avers that at all material times it had over 50 workers working at the Warehouse.  I am unable to identifyany circumstance in respect of the operations at the Warehouse or the occurrence of the Accident (and none has been suggested byMr Ho) in the affirmation evidence that would raise (a) any suspicion that the relevant tortfeasor involved in the Accident mightnot have been an employee of the Defendant, (b) any suspicion of the existence of <i>pro hac vice</i> employees at the Warehouse at the time of the Accident, and (c) any reasonably firmly held belief that would justify embarking onthe preliminaries to the making of a claim against Law/BLC or would warrant taking steps to identify the factual basis upon whichshe was said to be vicariously liable.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In such circumstances, I am firmly of the view there was no need for the Plaintiff to make enquiries with the Defendant on or before30 July 2007 as to whether any third party was involved in respect of the Accident.  In coming to this view, I also draw assistancefrom the reasons given by Seagroatt J for his decision in <i>Lau Yan Chor v Hang Lung (Administration) Ltd</i> HCPI 355/1999 (unreported, 19 September 2000) as discussed at pp.91-92 of <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In any event, even if the Plaintiff could have ascertained the identity of âAh Chingâ as the person involved in the Accidenton or before 30 July 2007 (ie within 4Â½ months after the Accident), still he would not have been in a position to frame a case againstLaw/BLC, and it would not have triggered the Plaintiffâs curiosity to investigate whether a third party would have been vicariouslyliable and/or to ascertain the factual basis for such vicarious liability.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Still further, even if the circumstances were to raise such index of suspicion that would render it reasonable for the Plaintiffto begin investigating further into the matter shortly after the Accident (which I disagree), it does not mean that the Plaintiffwould have been fixed with knowledge of the involvement of Law/BLC at such point in time or, say, within a month of the Accidentas suggested by Mr Ho. In my view, there is no reasonable probability that (a) the Defendant would have identified âAh Chingâas Wong Suk Ching, (b) the Plaintiff would have found out Wong Suk Ching was the relevant tortfeasor or (c) the Plaintiff would haveacquired knowledge of the factual basis upon which Law/BLC is allegedly vicariously liable for the alleged act or omission of âAhChingâ or Wong Suk Ching on or before 30 July 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  After all, although the Pre-action Letter dated 28 December 2009 refers to the Plaintiff being knocked down by a trolley or fork-lifttruck, and the Statement of Claim served on 9 April 2010 refers to âAh Chingâ, the Defendant and/or LL did not disclose the identityof âAh Chingâ as Wong Suk Ching and/or the identity of BLC as her general employer until service of the Defence on 23 June 2010. In the circumstances, I am not persuaded there is any sound basis for Mr Hoâs suggestion that earlier enquiries by the Plaintiffwould have elicited prompt clarification of the identities of âAh Chingâ and BLC, say, within a month of the Accident.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Taking all of the above matters into consideration, I am of the view that the Plaintiff upon taking reasonable steps to acquireinformation would only have known of the Defendant as the party who might have been vicariously liable and could not reasonably havebeen expected to acquire knowledge of Lawâs/BLCâs involvement on or prior to 30 July 2007.  On the basis of the Assumption andsince the Plaintiffâs actual and/or constructive knowledge has been acquired within the three-year period prior to the issue ofthe Summons (ie after 30 July 2007), his claim against Law/BLC is within time.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>X. JOINDER</i> <i>OF PARTY</i></p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  If the Plaintiffâs claim against BLC is not time-barred, the next question is whether leave should be granted to join Law/BLCas a further defendant in the present proceedings under Order 15 rule 6(2)(b) of the RHC which provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(2) Subject to the provision of this rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the Court may on such terms asit thinks just and either of its own motion or on application â</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(b) order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely â</p>						<blockquote>			    <p class="quote">(i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all mattersin dispute in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon, or</p>				<p class="quote">(ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating toor connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenientto determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.â</p>			</blockquote>		</blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  According to <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.15/6/1 at p.285, â[this] rule should be construed so as to bring all parties to disputes relating to one subject matterbefore the court at the same time so that the disputes may be determined without the delay, inconvenience and expense of separateactions and trials â¦â¦  Under it the court has power to secure the determination of all disputes, relating to the same subjectmatter, without delay and the expense of separate actions â¦â¦â  The effect of Order 15 rule 6(2)(b)(ii) of the RHC is to widenthe discretion of court as conferred by Order 15 rule 6(2)(b)(i).  The latter allows the adding of a necessary party and the formerpermits the adding of any person described therein if the question or issue is one which in the opinion of the court will be justand convenient to determine as between the applicant and a party to the proceedings as well as between the parties to proceedingsthemselves.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  To properly exercise such discretion, the court will have to determine to what extent Law/BLC (ie the party proposed to be joinedas a party to the proceedings) will assist the court in determining the issues in dispute and to what extent it is just and convenientto determine the issues between the Plaintiff and Law/BLC as well as between the existing parties to the present proceedings.  Indoing so, the court will have regard and give effect to the underlying objectives upon assessment of all the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  At first, Mr Ho submits that the test to be applied is whether the Plaintiffâs proposed claim against Law/BLC has any real prospectof success. Later, he argues the test should be whether such claim is triable and/or believable.  Mr Ho is unable to cite any directauthority to support either proposition, but draws analogy from <i>Kingâs Quality Homes Ltd v AJ Paints Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20All%20ER%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 All ER 267.</a></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  <i>Kingâs Quality Homes Ltd</i> held that a judge, in determining whether to grant an application for leave to substitute a new party, was entitled to have regardto the merits of the case if they were readily apparent to him. In that case, no remotely sustainable case of negligent misrepresentationwas made out in the statement of claim, so the application was refused.  At p.273, Staughton LJ readily recognised that the courtwould not decide questions of right on applications for amendment under Order 20 rule 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and wenton to say as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ I would have thought that a judge who on such an application would substitute a new party is entitled to have some regardto the merits of the case if they are readily visible to him. Of course he should not conduct a prolonged investigation into themerits, and if he is asked to so do he should not do it. If he can form a rough and ready view of the merits, I do not see why heshould not pay regard to it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In my view, this is a far cry from providing any positive support for the contention that before any joinder of a new defendant ispermitted the plaintiffâs claim must have real prospects of success or must be triable and/or believable.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In my view, given the objectives of Order 15 rule 6(2)(b) of the RHC outlined above, the courtâs power to join parties is a generousone, and the courtâs attitude is permissive although it must still ensure that the joinder is necessary and/or just having regardto the statutory criteria.  According to <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.15/6/1 at pp.285-286, â[the] power given by the rule is, however, widely exercised â¦â¦ though the addition of newparties may cause new expense and necessitate new evidence â¦â¦  But, generally speaking, the court will make all such changesin respect of parties as may be necessary to enable an effectual adjudication to be made concerning all matters in dispute â¦â¦ The court will not, however, decide questions of right on applications under the rule â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I am persuaded that the relevant approach to be adopted is whether there is a <i>bona fide</i> claim and a proper question to be tried as between the Plaintiff and Law/BLC that is necessary or just and convenient for resolutionbetween them as well as between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  On such basis, I turn to the Defendantâs arguments for suggesting that Law/BLC should not be joined as a further defendant inthe present proceedings, namely, that the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC (a) is bound to fail because there is no viable andbelievable factual basis for such claim, and (b) is inherently defective because the âworker in questionâ worked under the direction,supervision and/or control of the Defendant and not Law/BLC who did not retain any such direction, supervision and/or control.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(a) Plaintiffâs claim against BLC bound to fail?</i></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Ho argues that the evidence so far produced by the Plaintiff on how the Accident happened is so incredible, tenuous and/or contradictorythat it cannot constitute any viable or believable factual basis for any alleged cause of action against Law/BLC.  It is said thatsince the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is bound to fail, it becomes pointless to allow Law/BLC to be joined as a further defendantto the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Ho submits that the Plaintiffâs case against Law/BLC is unbelievable because he gave different accounts of how the Accidenthappened (which are highly discrepant) at different times as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) In the Notice of Accident dated 20 March 2007 (see paragraph 13 above), the Plaintiff states that he lost balance and fell backwardswhilst transporting goods with no mention of being knocked down by a trolley/cart pushed or pulled by someone else.</p>        <p>(b) The OT Reports dated 24 February and 27 October 2009 respectively (see paragraph 32 above) only mention a fall injury whilst carryingheavy objects but nothing about being knocked down by anything or anyone.</p>        <p>(c) The Orthopaedic Report (see paragraph 34 above) shows that it was only when the orthopaedic experts jointly examined the Plaintiffon 3 September 2009 that it was mentioned for the first time the Plaintiff was hit by something (but without stating what it was)when he was lifting some goods.</p>        <p>(d) It was not until the Pre-action Letter dated 28 December 2009 (see paragraph 18 above) that RLC alleged the Plaintiff was knockeddown by a trolley or fork-lift truck whilst unloading the Carton at the Warehouse.</p>        <p>(e) In the Statement of Claim filed on 7 April 2010, the Plaintiff pleads that he was knocked down by a trolley/cart which was pushedor pulled by the Defendantâs servant and/or agent being a female employee/worker called âAh Chingâ (see paragraph 2 above)without any alternative allegation of being hit by a fork-lift truck.</p>        <p>(f) The Plaintiffâs affirmation filed in reply to Ngâs affirmation in opposition claims that at the time of the Accident he waslifting the Carton when he was suddenly knocked down from behind by a moving object, which âseemed to himâ to be a trolley/cartor fork-lift truck, so he lost his balance and fell backwards to the ground with the Carton falling onto his chest. But later inthe same affirmation he said he âdid not knowâ what object hit or knocked him down and/or he was not âable to ascertain theidentity of the worker who hit or knocked [him] downâ (see paragraphs 52-53 above).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr Ho argues that putting the Plaintiffâs case to the highest, he only âsuggestsâ that he was hit by a trolley pushed/pulledby âAh Chingâ, but it does not logically follow from the bare hearsay assertion that âAh Chingâ was seen hurriedly pushinga trolley away from the Scene immediately after the Accident that it must be âAh Chingâ who hit him.  Mr Ho therefore contendsthat the essential causal connection in the Plaintiffâs case against Law/BLC is remote and indeed missing.  Mr Ho submits thateven if the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is put on trial now, he would not have been able to prove on the present state ofthe evidence it is more likely than not that he was hit by a trolley pushed by âAh Chingâ at the material time, so it is plainand obvious that the Plaintiffâs case against Law/BLC is bound to fail and there is no point in joining Law/BLC as a further defendantto the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Ho also criticises the evolution of the Plaintiffâs assertions as to how the Accident happened.  Apart from the various versionsset out in paragraph 76 above, the Plaintiff says in his affirmation that it was not until about November 2009 that he heard someex-colleagues said he was knocked down by a trolley or fork-lift truck.  The Plaintiff claims this explained why he could not havetold the treatment medical personnel and/or the orthopaedic experts what hit him, and this proved he did not make up his case.  Hefurther claims to have âcontinuously made enquiries with other colleagues who might have known the cause of [his] fall and theidentity of the worker who hit or knocked [him] downâ, but it was not until about February 2010 when he was able to locate hisex-colleagues Hung and Leung who told him they saw a female worker called âAh Chingâ hurriedly pushing a trolley away from theScene immediately after he was knocked down (see paragraph 53 above).  Mr Ho asks me to view the Plaintiffâs various accounts witha high degree of skepticism, but falls short of saying they are wholly unbelievable or not triable.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In my view, the Plaintiff has all along been consistent in saying that at the time of the Accident he was carrying heavy objectsand that he lost balance and fell backwards.  The issue is what caused him to fall. Did he slip and fall or was he knocked down bya trolley/cart pushed/pulled by someone?  In my view, ultimately it is a matter of factual evidence for investigation or considerationin the course of the litigation, and it is not so plain and obvious or so readily visible that the scales are already tipped in favourof Law/BLC at this stage.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  After all, as Mr Lau points out, the treatment medical personnel were concerned with therapeutic and not forensic matters, and thefact the Plaintiff fell backwards to the ground with the heavy objects falling on him might well have been sufficient medical historyfor diagnostic and treatment purposes, but the medical experts were forensically able to elicit more history from the Plaintiff ofbeing hit by something (see the Orthopaedic Report in paragraph 34 above) and by a moving trolley (see the single joint urology andpsychiatric expert reports in paragraphs 35-36 above).  As regards the account given to the Labour Department and in the Applicationin the EC Action, the only issue there is whether the Plaintiff suffered any injury on duty, but there was no serious challenge bythe Defendant on such issue that required expansion on the particulars of how the Accident occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  In my view, whether the Plaintiffâs explanation as to how he discovered he was hit from behind by a trolley/cart will be acceptedby the court or not is a matter of credibility of witnesses and assessment of the weight of the evidence which cannot be properlydetermined at this stage.  The court cannot come to any conclusive finding of fact on affidavit. Mr Lau frankly accepts that circumstantialevidence is relied on to show the person pushing/pulling the trolley/cart that hit the Plaintiff is âAh Chingâ.  However, accordingto the Plaintiff, both Hung and Leung confirm âAh Chingâ was pushing a trolley at the material time, and they placed her in temporaland spatial proximity with the occurrence of the Accident.  In such circumstances, I agree with Mr Lau that ultimately it is forthe court to decide whether it is appropriate to draw the factual inference that the Plaintiff was knocked down by the trolley/cartpushed by âAh Chingâ.  I bear in mind the Plaintiff has all along consistently claimed that he fell backwards to the ground,and it is therefore unsurprising on his case that he did not see and is therefore personally unable to say who or what hit him. The viability of his assertion that âAh Chingâ is the relevant tortfeasor should not turn on the fortuity of having eyewitness(es)or the misfortune of not having any eyewitness who can give direct evidence in respect of the circumstances of the Accident.  Inmy view, it is sufficient if the Plaintiff is able to put forward a reasonable basis from which appropriate factual inference maybe drawn so that there is a proper question to be tried.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  I am not persuaded it is plain and obvious that the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is not viable at all.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(b) Who</i> <i>is vicariously liable?</i></p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The Defendant contends that the Plaintiffâs case against Law/BLC is fundamentally flawed.  It is suggested that even assumingthe Plaintiff was actually hit by the trolley pushed/pulled by âAh Chingâ (being Wong Suk Ching and BLCâs general employee),it does not necessarily follow that Law/BLC is vicariously liable for any act or omission on the part of âAh Chingâ or Wong SukChing.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In his affirmation, Ng claims that Law was the nominal sole proprietor of BLC which carried on business of <i>inter alia</i> supplying labour for pick and pack service, but Ng (and not Law) was the one who was involved in the daily operations of BLCâsbusiness carried on from their matrimonial home.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Ng explains that since about April 2005 BLC entered into an agreement with the Defendant to supply labour for pick and pack serviceat the Warehouse, and pursuant to such agreement BLC supplied causal workers to the Defendant at the rate of HK$30.00/manhour orHK$40.00/manhour âwithout moreâ.  Such casual workers so supplied by BLC were required to sign simple employment agreements withBLC in the form of the Employment Agreement.  Ng claims that the casual workers assigned to work at the Warehouse worked under theDefendantâs direction, control and/or supervision in respect of the work they did, and BLC did not retain any direction, controland/or supervision.  BLC would not and did not (a) provide such casual workers with any tool, plant or equipment and/or (b) sendany supervisor to oversee their work at the Warehouse.  The pick and pack service was a simple manual packaging task, and the casualworkers could handle such task entirely on their own.  In any event, the Defendant would be responsible for instructing them on howto perform such task at the workplace and fixing their daily working hours as it wished.  The arrangement between the Defendant andBLC was merely one of supply of labour by BLC to the Defendant, so no vicarious liability attaches to Law/BLC.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr Ho also refers to the Defence and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> FBP Answers which provide that at all material times the Defendant had been exercising control, direction and/or supervision overits workers at the Warehouse as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) Before the alleged Accident, the Defendant had provided âadequate and proper training, instruction and guidance to its workers(including the Plaintiff) on working procedures and safetyâ, and had âarranged for its staff with a supervisory role to conductgeneral and regular inspection over the [Warehouse] and supervision over its workers (including the Plaintiff) to ensure that itstraining, instruction and guidance regarding working procedures and safety were followed and provide assistance wherever necessaryâ.</p>        <p>(b) The Defendant âinstructed its workers to keep the passageways of the [Warehouse] in a clean and tidy condition, and the workersthereat to be cautious of the surroundings when operating pallet trucks or forklift trucks. Moreover, it arranged for its staff withsupervisory role to conduct general and regular inspection over the [Warehouse] to make sure that a safe place of work was providedand maintainedâ.</p>        <p>(c) Oral instructions, guidance and training on working procedures and safety were given by its staff with a supervisory role (includingMr Kung Shing Chi) to its workers (including the Plaintiff) from time to time and whenever necessary. The exact date of the latestinstructions, guidance and training could not be recalled, but full particulars would be given in witness statements to be served.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is suggested that in such circumstances, the available evidence (including those produced by the Plaintiff) clearly points towardsthe fact that the Defendant had control not only over what âAh Chingâ was to do but also over how she was to do it at the materialtime.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  To properly deal such arguments, it is necessary to revisit the legal principles on vicarious liability in a situation where employerA lends his employee to employer B for a job and the employee causes damage in the course of doing that job.  Question may ariseas to whether the person vicariously liable for the damage is the general employer or the temporary employer or both. âThis isin each case a question of fact; and the facts of one case cannot govern another.  They are only useful so far as similarity of factsare a help and guide to decision â¦â¦ no universal and conclusive test can be laid down â¦â¦  It is to be borne in mind thatthe general employer has a heavy burden of proof to discharge if he is to avoid liability and this probably means that he will beliable unless he proves affirmatively that the temporary employer has acquired the right to control the method of working.  It willnot suffice for him to prove merely that he does not have that right himselfâ (see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 12<sup>th</sup> ed para.6-23 at pp.367-368).</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The leading authority is <i>Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins &amp; Griffiths (Liverpool) Ltd &amp; McFarlane</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%202%20All%20ER%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] 2 All ER 345.</a>  The House of Lords made clear that decision as to whether vicarious liability fell on the general or temporary employer dependedon the particular facts and many factors might bear in the result, and in assessing the facts, certain considerations that wouldor might be relevant would include the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) the burden of showing that responsibility did not remain with the general employer was on him and such burden was a heavy one;</p>        <p>(b) there should be consideration as to who engaged, paid and had power to dismiss the negligent employee;</p>        <p>(c) the court had to consider who had the immediate direction and control of the manner of execution of the relevant work, but ifthere existed such authority, its exercise or non-exercise on the occasion of the doing of the act in question was irrelevant;</p>        <p>(d) responsibility should lie with the employer in whose act some degree of fault, though remote, might be found.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(see <i>Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern Ltd) &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%204%20All%20ER%201181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 4 All ER 1181</a>, 1184-1185).</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  <i>Denham v Midland  Employers Mutual Assurance Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20QB%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 QB 437</a> emphasised that the inquiry on this issue should concentrate on the relevant negligent act and ask whose responsibility it was toprevent it and who was entitled or theoretically obliged to give orders as to how the work should or should not be done.

In the former case the particular employer to whom he has been hired, having directedhim to carry out a particular task which gives rise to a risk to some third party, bears responsibility if in carrying it out theemployee causes injury.

It was held that the fact he worked under the main contractorsâ directions did not impliedly release thegeneral employerâs personal duty to take reasonable care that he would not be exposed to unnecessary risk of injury, so his generalemployer remained liable to him even though they delegated their task to the main contractorsâ site foreman.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  In <i>Nelhams</i>, the plaintiff was a painter employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was engaged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to do decoration work and who was in turn sub-contracted to the main contractors.  The project was running out of timeand the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants agreed that employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would work overtime at the direction and under the supervision of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  After the main contractors had left the site, the plaintiff was instructed by an employee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to do painting work and suffered an accident.  After considering several factors, including the attitude of the main contractorsand the fact that the plaintiff was âclearly a mature man and responsible employeeâ such that the general employer would thinkit unlikely that the employer <i>pro hac vice</i> would operate in an unsafe manner, it was held that the employer <i>pro hac vice</i> had to completely indemnify the general employer.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Given the important distinction between employers being vicariously liable for act done by their employee (as in <i>Mersey Docks and Harbour Board</i>) and employers being liable for injury done to the employee himself (as in <i>Morris</i>, <i>Nelhams</i> and <i>Kwok Wai</i>), I am not persuaded that the latter cases are of assistance in the present context where âthe worker in questionâ being âAhChingâ or Wong Suk Ching was the alleged direct tortfeasor rather than the injured person.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Recent developments of the law in this area in England has opened the possibility that in cases where the courts are simply unableto decide which of employer A or employer B should be held vicariously liable, they may impose dual vicarious liability even thoughit has been suggested that the concept of dual vicarious liability ought not to be over-used (see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 12<sup>th</sup> ed para.6-25 at p.368).</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In <i>Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd</i>, the question that arose was whether a fitterâs mate supplied on a labour-only basis by employer A to employer B would render Aor B vicariously liable in respect of any tort committed by the mate.  On the basis that both employers had sufficient control ofthe mate to prevent negligence, May LJ focused the courtâs attention on the question of control and thought it appropriate to holdthem both vicariously liable for flooding caused by the mateâs negligence, but he did not envisage a finding of dual vicariousliability in many factual situations.  By contrast Rix LJ adopted a broader approach, and even though the degree of control was stillrelevant and important, he considered the critical test to be whether the employee âis so much a part of the work, business ororganisation of both employers that is just to make both employers answer for his negligence.  However, finding that the mate wasequally integrated into both A and Bâs organisations, he, too, felt it appropriate to impose dual vicarious liability â¦â¦  Furthermore,since vicarious liability does not require fault to be shown on the part of an employer, it was said to follow that where it is appropriateto impose vicarious liability, it will typically be shared equally between two employersâ (see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 20<sup>th</sup> ed para.6-25 at p.368).</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  The English Court of Appeal declined to invoke the dual vicarious liability principle in <i>Hawley v Luminar Leisure Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20PIQR%20P17" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] PIQR P17</a> to hold that a borrowed doorman of a nightclub was the employee of two employers on the ground that there had been effective andsubstantial transfer of control from employer A to employer B.  Employer B was entitled and therefore obliged to control the doormanâsactivities so as to prevent the act complained of, and employer A had no immediate or effective control over the activities of thedoorman.  Further, the doorman had been seconded to employer Bâs nightclub for so long that he had become embedded in employerBâs organisation and was no longer recognisable as an employee of employer A.  As between employer B as deemed employer and employerA as general employer, employer Aâs negligence could be found to have had a negligible cumulative effect.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In <i>Biffa Waste Services Ltd &amp; anor v Maschinenfabrik Ernst Hese GmbH &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%20QB%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] QB 725</a>, Stanley Burnton LJ in giving the judgment of the court held that (a) exceptional facts were required for a contractor to be vicariouslyliable for the negligence of his sub-contractor, (b) only where the agreement between them was to be taken as conferring on the contractorthe power to control the manner of execution of the work could vicarious liability be transferred from sub-contractor to contractor,and (c) the right to supervise did not, without more, carry with it the entitlement to instruct how to do the work, particularlywhere the employee was skilled.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  In that case, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (which had the contract to build a new waste disposal plant and was in overall charge of the site) had been supervisingskilled welders/grinders who used their own equipment under their own foreman.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (an overseas company with no local presence which won the contract to design and construct a ball mill on the site andwhich sub-contracted the construction to a third party sub-contractor) had not been exercising control over them which an employerwould have exercised.  The work of the welders/grinders for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was temporary, and they had not become part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs business or undertaking. Instead, the third party had sent more personnel than contracted for to do the job, so the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was held not vicariously liable for the weldersâ negligence just on the basis that they had temporarily become its employees.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Mr Ho fairly accepts that the issue of who should be vicariously liable is a question of fact. Hallett LJ in giving the judgmentof the court in <i>Hawley</i> said at p.220 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThus, the decision as to whether or not an employee remains an employee of the general employer for the purposes of vicarious liabilityor whether he is deemed to be the temporary employee of the hirer of his services very much turns on the facts of the individualcase. The burden of showing that responsibility has moved to a temporary employer rests on the general employer and is a heavy one.The inquiry should focus on the negligent act and the court should ask itself whose duty it was to prevent that act. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  There is no dispute that at the material time Law/BLC was the general employer of Wong Suk Ching and that she worked at the Warehouseon the day of the Accident.  Information forthcoming from the Defendantâs Hui and Chan suggests that Wong Suk Ching was commonlyreferred to as âAh Chingâ, and Hui saw her hurriedly pushing a trolley at the Scene shortly after the Accident occurred.  Inmy view, there may arguably be a <i>prima facie</i> inference that Law/BLC was the general employer of the alleged direct tortfeasor.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  On such basis, Law/BLC (rather than the Plaintiff and/or the Defendant) carries the heavy burden of showing that responsibilityfor the alleged negligent act of âAh Chingâ or Wong Yuk Ching (ie pushing/pulling the trolley to knock down the Plaintiff) hadmoved from her to the Defendant.  It will be necessary to consider whose responsibility it was to prevent such alleged negligentact and who was theoretically obliged to give orders on how such work should be done, and whether âAh Chingâ or Wong Yuk Chinghad become so integrated into the Defendantâs work, business or organisation that the Defendant became responsible for her. Inmy view, all these matters are plainly fact-sensitive. But Ng in his affirmation merely asserts that the direction, control and/orsupervision over the casual workers had passed from Law/BLC to the Defendant without condescending into the factual particulars ofthe specific tasks and/or assigned works carried out by them at the Warehouse and the specific direction, control and/or supervisionthat were pertinent to the negligent act in question. Further, the particulars given in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> FBP Answers in paragraph 86 above are in respect of the Defendantâs averment in the Defence that if it owed any duty of care tothe Plaintiff it had discharged such duty by taking all reasonable steps, and not in respect of any denial of vicarious liabilityfor any act and/or omission of any general employee of Law/BLC.  In my view, it is not so plain and obvious or so apparently visiblethat the issue of potential vicarious liability can be arrested at this stage as suggested by Mr Ho.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(c) Summary</i></p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  I am satisfied that the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is <i>bona fide</i> and raises a proper question to be tried.  I am further satisfied that she is a party whose presence is necessary to ensure thatall matters in dispute are effectually and completely determined.  It is evident from the existing pleadings that whether the Accidentwas caused by any tortious act of âAh Chingâ being Wong Suk Ching, and if so, whether the Defendant or Law/BLC or both are vicariouslyliable for such act are already live issues between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  The Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC whichis premised on Law/BLC being vicarious liable for tortious conduct by her general employee Wong Suk Ching plainly raises a questionor issue relating to or connected with the reliefs claimed in the present proceedings between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  Inmy view, it will be just and convenient to determine this issue between the Plaintiff and Law/BLC as well as between the existingparties.  The issues of delay and additional costs occasioned by the joinder are not sufficient reasons to militate against the exerciseof my discretion in the Plaintiffâs favour, which discretion, I note, can be exercised on own motion or on application.  I thereforeorder that Law formerly trading as BLC be added as a further defendant in the present proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>XI. DISCRETIONARY EXTENSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  If I am wrong and the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is time-barred, I proceed to consider whether I should exercise my discretionto allow such claim to proceed under section 30.  Section 30 provides that if it appears to the court that it would be equitableto allow the action to proceed having regard to the degree to which (a) the provisions of section 27 prejudice the plaintiff and(b) any decision of the court under this subsection would prejudice the defendant or any person whom he represents, the court maydirect that those provisions shall not apply to the action, or shall not apply to any specified cause of action to which the actionrelates.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(a) Courtâs approach</i></p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  As explained at p.94 in <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i>, the discretion to disapply the limitation period is entirely unfettered.  The onus is on the plaintiff to show that in the particularcircumstances of the case it would be equitable to allow the claim to proceed having regard to the respective prejudice likely tobe suffered by each party, but the defendant has to prove the prejudice he says he will suffer.  The court then performs a balancingexercise by looking at (a) the balance of prejudice as to each party, (b) the six specific but non-exhaustive factors contained insection 30(3), and (c) all the circumstances of the case (see also <i>Ng Ngan Chiu v Paramount Printing Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20557" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 557).</a></p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Before <i>A v Hoare</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20All%20ER%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 All ER 1</a>, the leading English case on the correct approach under section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 (â<u>Act</u>â) (ie the English equivalent of section 30) was <i>KR &amp; ors v Bryn Alyn Community (Holdings) Ltd (in liquidation) &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20All%20ER%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 All ER 716.</a>  At pp.741-743, Auld J set out the relevant starting points which he considered to be âwell-established and/or uncontroversialâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ (i) In multiple claims of this sort, a judge should consider the exercise of his discretion separately in relation to eachclaim â¦â¦ (ii) The burden of showing that it would be equitable to disapply the limitation period lies on the claimant and itis a heavy burden.

The overall question was whether it would be âequitableâto disapply the limitation provision having regard to the balance of potential prejudice weighed with regard to all the circumstancesof the case including the six specific factors. Stripping away legal niceties, the question was whether, given the delays, the judgecould fairly try the claim, and all would depend on the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  In <i>Donovan v Gwentoys Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20WLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 WLR 472</a>, it was held that prejudice which occurred before the expiry of the limitation period was a relevant matter for the court to considerin deciding whether to override any limitation period.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Lord Hoffmann in <i>Horton v Sadler</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20PIQR%20P30" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] PIQR P30</a>, a case cited by Mr Lau, said at p.514 that âsince [<i>Thompson v Brown</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20744" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 744]</a> the practice of the courts has been regularly to exercise the discretion in favour of the plaintiff in all cases in which the defendantcannot show that he has been prejudiced by the delay â¦â¦ the plea of limitation which the statute confers upon the defendant is,in the absence of forensic prejudice, described as a windfall of which he can properly be deprivedâ. Such observations were approvedby Tang VP in <i>Chuck Wai Man v Asia Television Ltd</i> CACV29/2008 (unreported, 9 September 2008). Indeed, in <i>A v Hoare</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20All%20ER%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 All ER 1</a>, Baroness Hale at p.21 said she fully supported a more generous approach to the exercise of discretion, and Lord Carswell at pp.26-27said there needed to be a more liberal approach to the exercise of the discretion.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In <i>Cain v Francis; McKay v Hamlani &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%202%20All%20ER%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 2 All ER 579</a> (as in <i>Horton</i>),loss of the limitation defence was the only prejudice the defendant would suffer since no forensic prejudice was relied on at all. The court was of the view that the limitation defence would have been a complete windfall and fairness required the action to beallowed to continue. This type of case must be contrasted with the case where forensic prejudice was suffered by a defendant whohad not for many years been notified of a claim in any detail to enable him to investigate it.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Smith LJ at p.599 in <i>Cain</i> reiterated that in the exercise of discretion, the basic question to be asked was whether it was fair and just in all the circumstancesto expect the defendant to meet the plaintiffâs claim on the merits notwithstanding the delay.  The judge had to ascertain to whatextent the defendant suffered any forensic disadvantage in his investigation of the claim and/or the assembly of evidence.  The reasonfor the delay was also important.  The delay could be for so excusable a reason that looking at the matter in the round fairnessand justice required the action to proceed or there could be no good reason for the delay or for its length that caused proceduraldisadvantage and unfairness to the defendant.  â[It] will always be relevant to consider when the defendant knew that a claim wasto be made against him and also the opportunities he has had to investigate the claim and collect evidence â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  At pp.600-601, Sir Andrew Morritt C said the purpose of section 33 of the Act was to enable the court to review the position inlight of the facts and circumstances of each individual case in order to determine whether the action should proceed to trial:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[80] â¦â¦ Has that delay caused prejudice to the defendant in its defence? If so, does it outweigh the prejudice to the claimantof being denied a trial at all? In addition the court will need to consider all the circumstances of the case and in particular tothe other aspects of the case enumerated in sub-s (3).</p>        <p class="quote">[81] In that context it does not appear to me that the loss of a limitation defence is regarded as a head of prejudice to the defendantat all; it is merely the obverse of the disapplication of s 11 which is assumed. It is this consideration which, in my view, accountsfor and justifies the marked reluctance of the courts, as demonstrated by the judgments to which Smith LJ has referred in detail,to have regard to the loss of a limitation defence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  The Court of Appeal in <i>Ng Ngan Chiu</i> also held that the prejudice resulting from loss of the limitation defence would almost always be balanced by the prejudice to theplaintiff from the operation of the limitation provision so the loss of the limitation defence as such would be of little importance. What was of paramount importance was the effect of the delay on the defendantâs ability to defend (see also <i>Hartley v Birmingham City District Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20All%20ER%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 All ER 212</a>, 214).  What was also important to bear in mind was that the primary purpose of the limitation period was to protect a defendantfrom the injustice of having to face a stale claim, ie a claim which he never expected to have to deal with (see <i>Ng Ngan Chiu</i> at p.563).</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  <i>B v Nugent Care Society; GR v Wirral MBC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%20PIQR%20P3" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] PIQR P3</a> emphasised that the discretion was wide and unfettered, repeated what had been said in <i>Bryn Alyn Community (Holdings) Ltd</i> as the relevant starting points, and confirmed they continued to be valid <i>post-Hoare</i>.  The English Court of Appeal gave further guidance on three particular points:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) For (ii), although the exercise of the discretion was an exceptional indulgence to the claimant because otherwise his claim wouldhave been time-barred, the discretion was wide and unfettered (para.20 at p.55).</p>        <p>(b) For (vi), there were likely to be many cases in which a judge would consider it not feasible to decide the issues simply by referenceto the pleadings, the written witness statements and the extent/content of discovery and conclude it would be desirable to have oralevidence because the strength of the claimantâs evidence seemed to be relevant to the way in which the discretion should be exercised.In particular, in relation to the cogency of the claimantâs case, oral evidence might be extremely valuable in throwing light bothon the prejudice suffered by the defendant and the extent to which the claimant was reasonably inhibited in commencing proceedings(para.21 at p.55).</p>        <p>(c) In considering the exercise of discretion to disapply the limitation provision, the judge must consider all the circumstancesincluding any prejudice to the defendant and what evidence would or might have been available to the defendant if a trial had takenplace earlier or he had learned of the claim earlier (para.25 at p.57).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  I referred both counsel to <i>McDonnell v Walker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%20PIQR%20P5" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] PIQR P5.</a> Waller LJ (with whom Rimer LJ and Sir Paul Kennedy agreed) after referring to <i>A v Hoare</i> and <i>Bryn Alyn Community (Holdings) Ltd</i> emphasised two points at p.112: â(i) depending on the issues and the nature of the evidence going to them the longer the delaythe more likely and the greater, the prejudice to the defendant; and (ii) a judge should not reach a decision by reference to onecircumstance or without regard to all the issues â he should conduct a balancing exercise at the end of his analysis of all therelevant circumstances and with regard to all the issues, taking them all into accountâ.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Waller LJ went on to say at pp.118-119 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â35. If delay has caused forensic prejudice to the defendant, then one must consider the cause of the delay.

On the otherhand if the delay has caused unfairness to the defendant in his ability to investigate it <u>and</u> there is no excuse for the delay, the action should not be allowed to proceed. I would add, where there has been inexcusable andlengthy delay in a claimant notifying a defendant as to his case on liability or as in this case quantum and there has been negligencein issuing the proceedings or in serving them on time, that is a situation in which it almost speaks for itself that a defendanthas suffered forensic disadvantage and a claimant is unlikely to suffer prejudice.</p>        <p class="quote">36.

According to the BLC Invoice (see paragraph 24(g) above), BLCsupplied 8 workers to the Defendant to work at the Warehouse on 8 March 2007. According to the BLC Voucher (see paragraph 24(h) above),é»æ·è²(transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) appeared to be one of such 8 workers, but Ng claims one cannot tell from such documentwhether the alleged direct tortfeasor âAh Chingâ was one of them.  Further, there was no reply from the Defendant, so after ONCLliased with LL on 12 August, 20 August and 3 September 2010 (see paragraphs 27-29 above), Ng contacted é»æ·è² (transliterationof Wong Suk Ching) by telephone.

He submits that to rigorously apply the three-yearlimit would effectively end the Plaintiffâs claim, which potentially will be a far greater detriment to her than any prejudiceto the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(b) Six specific factors</i></p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  For the purpose of convenience, I discuss the six specific factors in section 30(3) in turn even though I accept they cannot beanalysed in isolation from one another.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  <i>Length of delay and reasons by the plaintiff.</i>  As noted in <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i> at p.96, the test is a subjective one and the delay under section 30(3)(a) refers to delay since expiry of the limitation period. Mr Lau refers to <i>Chuck Wai Man</i> where the Court of Appeal disapplied the limitation period under section 27.  Reyes J said at para.19 that ââ¦â¦ the key factorwhich tips the balance decisively in favour of disapplying the s.27 limitation is the fact that only 18 days have passed betweenthe expiry of the 3 year limit and the issuing of the writâ.  The learned judge said given that ârelatively very short periodâ,it was unlikely that the defendantâs position could have been adversely affected in any significant way by the late filing of thewrit.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Here, the <i>post</i>-expiry delay was about 4Â½ months from 7 March to 30 July 2010. On any view, it is not a particularly long period of delay, and Ifind such delay acceptable given the Defendantâs failure to mention BLC until service of the Defence on 23 June 2010 (which inany event is outside the limitation period) and further given the time required for RLC to make enquires as a result of such revelationin the Defence.  Indeed, ONCL by their letter dated 15 July 2010 requested RLC to withhold action until their substantive reply on29 July 2010 (see paragraph 24 above) whereupon the Plaintiff issued the Summons on the following day.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  <i>Effect of any delay on the cogency of the evidence.</i>  Here, the evidential burden is on the âdefendantâ to show that the evidence to be adduced by him is likely to be less cogentbecause of the delay.  Again, delay under section 30(3)(b) is delay since the expiry of the limitation period.  The key questionis whether the âdefendantâ would be in a worse position for dealing with the factual issues than he would have been if the claimwere issued within time.  It is more convenient to deal with the issues of <i>pre-</i> and <i>post-</i>expiry delay in the discussion below, but suffice to say here there is insufficient information before me that by reason of the <i>post-</i>expiry delay of about 4Â½ months the evidence to be adduced by Law/BLC is likely to be less cogent than if the action against herhas been brought within time.  There is no evidence to suggest that during that period of about 4Â½ months (a) previously availablewitnesses were lost, (b) available witnesses had increased difficulty in remembering the event and/or the details, or (c) relevantdocuments were lost.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  <i>Conduct of the defendant after the cause of action arose</i>.

As explained above, the Plaintiff issued theSummons on 30 July 2010 shortly after becoming aware of the involvement of Law/BLC upon service of the Defence on 23 June 2010 (seeparagraphs 5-7 above), raising enquiries with the Defendant, LL, Law/BLC and ONCL in June/July 2010 (see paragraphs 20-24 above),acceding to ONCLâs request made on 15 July 2010 to withhold legal action pending their substantive reply (see paragraph 24 above)and receiving such substantive reply from ONCL on 29 July 2010 (see paragraph 24 above), which I find to be reasonable and promptaction on the part of the Plaintiff and/or his legal advisors.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  <i>Diligence of the plaintiff in obtaining medical, legal or other expert advice.</i>  There is irrelevant since neither party suggests that the Plaintiff should obtain medical, legal or other advice in order to takereasonable steps to bring a claim or make a complaint.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(c) Equity, prejudice and all the circumstances of the case</i></p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  As explained above, although section 30(3)(a)-(b) require the court to look at <i>post</i>-expiry delay the need to look at all the circumstances of the case allows the court to consider what prejudice has occurred withinthe limitation period.  The court has to consider the matter broadly in determining whether or not it will be possible for the defendantto investigate allegations and to ask whether there is a reasonable prospect of a fair trial.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Mr Lau submits that the primary consideration is whether Law/BLC will be prejudiced in her defence because her evidence will beless cogent owing to the passage of time, but Law/BLC suffers no prejudice in this regard because she is not bereft of witness evidence. According to Ng, he has been able to contact Wong Suk Ching who categorically denies having caused the Accident, and therefore shecan be subpoenaed or asked to give evidence at trial.  Mr Lau adds that the Plaintiffâs ex-colleagues Hung and Leung saw âAhChingâ at the Scene in the immediate aftermath of the Accident and they can give evidence and be cross-examined accordingly.  Presumablythe Defendant will also call witnesses to shed light on the circumstances and events culminating in the Accident.  Mr Lau arguesthat the ultimate question is whether âAh Chingâ or Wong Suk Ching did or did not injure the Plaintiff, and there is no evidencethat Wong Suk Chingâs memory has dimmed with the passing of time.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  I agree with Mr Lauâs observations.  Further, if Law/BLC suggests it is unclear whether é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong SukChing) and é¦®ç´ è² (transliteration of Fung So Ching) is âAh Chingâ, there is no evidence before me of any attempt by Ng/Lawto contact Fung So Ching nor is there any suggestion that Fung So Ching as a target for investigation or as potential witness hasbeen lost or is now being unhelpful or her memory has dimmed due to any delay.  Still further, Ngâs affirmation shows that at allmaterial times he was in charge of the daily operations of BLC and he is able to give evidence on the arrangements between Law/BLCand the Defendant for deploying casual workers to perform pick and pack service at the Warehouse as well as on the scope of dutiesof BLCâs casual workers and the supervision, direction and/or control over them.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  As regards the issue of any loss of documentary evidence, I note that Law/BLC concedes that é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong SukChing) and é¦®ç´ è² (transliteration of Fung So Ching) were both assigned to work and did work at the Warehouse on the day of theAccident.  Further, as regards the written agreement between the Defendant and Law/BLC, the BLC Quotation and the terms of agreementbetween the Defendant and Law/BLC are still available.  Although the Defendantâs signed acceptance of the BLC Quotation and thespecific Employment Agreements signed by Wong Suk Ching and Fung So Ching are no longer available, there is nothing before me toshow how long these documents would have been retained if at all, and how their âlossâ was caused by the Plaintiffâs delay. In any event, Ng confirms that the signed Employment Agreements are based on a standard form (which is still available), so theterms of employment as well as the remuneration of the casual workers assigned to work at the Warehouse are still known.  More importantly,in light of the defence argument outlined by Ng (ie é»æ·è² (transliteration of Wong Suk Ching) âdenied even hitting the Plaintiffby trolley or cart at all when she worked at [the Defendantâs] workplaceâ), I am unable to see how any âlossâ of the aforesaiddocuments renders such defence contention less cogent.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  As both counsel agree, the Plaintiff has a reasonably arguable claim on quantum.  Mr Lau submits that if the time bar is not disapplied,the Plaintiff will be deprived of making such claim against Law/BLC.  Mr Ho suggests it is unfair and prejudicial to let the Plaintiffhang such litigation (which by nature is stressful) over Law/BLC and force her to incur substantial time, costs and resources todefend such claim.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  As explained in <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i> at p.99, it is not appropriate to take into account the factor of prejudice due to the action hanging over the head of Law/BLC forso many years because she simply had no knowledge that any action was contemplated against her (see <i>Dobbie v Medway Health Autrhority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%204%20All%20ER%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 4 All ER 450</a>, 462 and <i>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</i> Vol.1, Division VI, para.788 at pp.111-112).  Indeed, Law/BLC claims she was unaware of the Accident until she received RLCâs letterdated 8 July 2010 on 12 July 2010.  For the period after that, it turns largely on the question of whether the Plaintiffâs claimagainst Law/BLC is a <i>bona fide</i> one that deserves to be investigated at trial.  If it is, the Sword of Damocles hanging over her will hardly be able to sufficientlyweigh and tip the scales in her favour.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  This conveniently brings me to Mr Hoâs submissions that the Plaintiffâs claim against Law/BLC is âunmeritoriousâ litigationand âa mere claimâ based on tenuous and shady indirect hearsay âevidenceâ as explained above.  Mr Ho refers to <i>Beer v London Borough of Waltham Forest</i>, December 16, 1987 (unreported) for the proposition that this is a relevant factor in the exercise of discretion under section 30. In that case, Hodgson J held that the apparent strength of the plaintiffâs case was a factor which could legitimately be takeninto account in deciding whether to exercise the discretion under section 33 of the Act, a very strong case being a factor pointingin the directions of allowing the action to be brought (see McGee, <i>Limitation Periods</i> 6<sup>th</sup> ed para.8/054 at p.187).</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  In considering the courtâs approach on the issue of strength of the plaintiffâs claim in the exercise of the section 30 discretion,I have referred to the following cases in <i>Cheung Yin Heung</i> at pp.100-101: <i>Dale v British Coal Corp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20PIQR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] PIQR 373</a>, 380 <i>per</i> Stuart-Smith LJ, <i>Yip Wing Hong v Maeda Corp</i> HCPI518/2000, Master Ho (unreported, 11 May 2001), <i>Yeung Mo Shing v Chung Fai Engineering Co Ltd</i> HCPI 301/2002, Recorder E Chan SC (unreported, 26 February 2003), <i>Li Chung Hung v Secretary for Justice</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKLRD%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKLRD 60</a>, 73 <i>per</i> Deputy Judge Carlson, and <i>McGhie v British Telecommunications Plc</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWCA Civ 48</a>, para.35 <i>per</i> May LJ.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  In my view, it suffices to refer to the judgment of Stuart-Smith LJ in <i>Dale</i> which he reiterated in <i>Forbes v Wandswoth Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20All%20ER%20881" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 All ER 881</a>, 894-895 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe first concerns the relevance of the plaintiffâs prospects of success in the action and the evidence necessary to be adducedto establish those prospects. Although not one of the matters specifically dealt with in paragraphs (a) to (f) of section 33(3),it is one of the circumstances of the case which the court should take into account in considering the balance of hardship. Plainlyit is more prejudicial to a plaintiff to be deprived of a cause of action when it is almost bound to succeed â¦â¦ than one thatlooks highly speculative. Equally, although it is always prejudicial to a defendant to be deprived of a defence under the LimitationAct, it may be less inequitable or unfair where the plaintiff has a strong case and more unfair where he has a weak one. But whereas here the limitation issue is tried and determined before the merits of the claim, the court cannot and should not attempt to determinethe merits on affidavit evidence. All that can be done and should be done is for the judge to take an overall view of the prospectsof success; a judge who is experienced in this type of litigation should have no difficulty in doing so.â (pp.380-381)</p>        <p class="quote">â The onus is on the plaintiff to satisfy the court that the primary limitation period should not apply. He must show that thereis evidence which, if accepted, will establish the necessary ingredients of his cause of action. In many cases his own evidence onaffidavit may suffice. If it is accepted, then he should succeed. It is not normally appropriate for the defendants to try and counterthe evidence at that stage. The matter cannot be tried on affidavit, and as I have said the best the judge can do is to take a viewof the prospects. â¦â¦â (at p.382)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  In my view, the court can only take a broad view of the matter at this stage, and it is inappropriate to go into the details ofthe evidence and the credibility of witnesses.  The EC Action and the consent order dated 27 July 2009 therein (see paragraph 17above) as well as the treatment medical reports concerning the Plaintiffâs condition in the immediate aftermath after the Accident(see paragraphs 30-31 above) lend support to the Plaintiffâs case that the Accident did occur.  As to the blameworthiness of Law/BLC,I note that the Plaintiffâs ex-colleagues Hung and Leung placed âAh Chingâ at the Scene immediately after the Accident in theact of hurriedly pushing away a trolley.  Further, as Mr Lau suggests, presumably the Defendant will call witnesses to shed lighton the circumstances and events culminating in the Accident, and on the extent of the direction, control and/or supervision overthe casual workers assigned by Law/BLC to work at the Warehouse in support of its defence allegation that BLC is vicariously liablefor the activities of âAh Chingâ or Wong Suk Ching.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  There is no need for me to express any view on Mr Lauâs submission that if Wong Suk Ching caused the Accident by pushing the trolleyand knocking down the Plaintiff, the Plaintiffâs case against Law/BLC would be stronger than that against the Defendant on thebasis that the general employee of Law/BLC would have been the direct tortfeasor in causing the Plaintiffâs fall.  In my view,whilst the Plaintiff does not have an overwhelming or cast-iron case against Law/BLC, it cannot be said to have a weak case.  Itis a genuine claim that deserves investigation in the course of litigation, and that is sufficient.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(d) Summary</i></p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  On the information before the court, it must be reasonably arguable to draw inference to the effect that the Plaintiff was knockeddown by the trolley pushed or pulled by âAh Chingâ who according to the Defendant is Wong Yuk Ching. Mr Ho is unable to pointto, in the words of Deputy Judge Carlson in <i>Li Chi Hung</i>, a fairly obvious âloserâ which would tip the scales in the favour of Law/BLC.  I am not persuaded that the strength of the Plaintiffâscase is a factor that weighs heavily in favour of Law/BLC. On the state of the affidavit evidence before me, I find the contentionsof either party evenly balanced, and I approach the issue of delay and evidential prejudice on such basis.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  In all, witness recollection will be no weaker now than it would have been if the claim against Law/BLC had been brought in time. Fading memory has little significance when Wong Suk Ching and Ng can both speak to matters as outlined in Ngâs affirmation.  Whilstsome specific documentation has been lost (although not necessarily as a result of any delay), the BLC Quotation, BLC Invoice, BLCVoucher and standard-form Employment Agreement are still available.  With the availability of Ng and Wong Suk Ching as witnessesand the surviving documents, and having assessed all the circumstances and the six specific factors (including the fact that thePlaintiff has a reasonably substantial claim for damages), I am persuaded that a fair trial is still possible.  It therefore seemsto me that in the exercise of discretion to do equity it is fair and just in all the circumstances for Law/BLC to meet the Plaintiffâsclaim on the merits notwithstanding any delay.  She is not so prejudiced by any <i>pre-</i> and/or <i>post-</i>expiry delay (which has arisen for an excusable reason) that her right to a fair opportunity to defend herself has been compromised. In all the circumstances and balancing the prejudice to either party, I am of the view that I should disapply section 27.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>XII. CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  I therefore order that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) Law formerly trading as BLC be added as the second defendant in the present proceedings;</p>        <p>(b) leave be granted to the Plaintiff to amend the Writ of Summons in the manner marked in red as <i>per</i> the draft annexed to the Summons;</p>        <p>(c) the Plaintiff shall file and serve the Amended Writ of Summons within 7 days from today;</p>        <p>(d) Law formerly trading as BLC being the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant shall file acknowledgment of service within 14 days thereafter.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  In respect of paragraphs 5-7 of the reliefs sought in the Summons, I direct that the Plaintiff do within 14 days from today takeout an <i>inter partes</i> summons (â<u>Amendment Summons</u>â) for leave to amend the Statement of Claim with draft Amended Statement of Claim annexed thereto and for consequential directions,and such summons shall be made returnable and paragraphs 5-7 of the reliefs sought in the Summons shall be restored for hearing atthe same time before the PI Master for three-minute hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  At the hearing, I have reserved the issue of the restoration of the present proceedings for further Checklist Review (â<u>CLR</u>â) hearing.  However, it is inappropriate to fix the date for the adjourned CLR hearing pending the outstanding amendments to thepleadings.  In the circumstances, I direct RLC to forthwith notify LL in writing of the terms of this order, including the costsorder <i>nisi</i> below, and reserve for the PI Master hearing the Amendment Summons to fix the date for the adjourned CLR hearing.  All parties arejointly and severally required to remind the PI Master of such directions at the hearing of the Amendment Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  At the hearing, I made the following orders on costs:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) costs of and occasioned by the inclusion of (i) all items of documents in Bundle C (correspondence bundle) of the hearing bundle(save and except for pages 495-496, 669-670, 713-714 and 716-717) and (ii) items 4, 6-8, 12 and 15 in Bundle A (bundle of pleadings,orders, summons and affirmations) of the hearing bundle to which ONCL has raised objection be paid by the Plaintiff to Law/BLC tobe summarily assessed if not agreed;</p>        <p>(b) the issue of costs of and occasioned by any duplication of documents in Bundle B of the hearing bundle be reserved for considerationand, where appropriate, determination at the hearing of the summary assessment of the aforesaid costs order, and, where appropriate,the relevant party(ies) shall submit his/their statement(s) of costs at such hearing.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  In respect of the joinder application, I see no reason why costs should not follow event, and both counsel agree there should becertificate for counsel.  I therefore grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that (a) save and except for the aforesaid costs orders made at the hearing, Law/BLC do pay the Plaintiffâs costs of the joinderapplication (including all costs reserved if any) to be summarily assessed with certificate for counsel and (b) costs of and occasionedby the application for amendment of the Writ of Summons be costs in the cause, and the Plaintiffâs own costs be taxed in accordancewith <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  As regards summary assessment of costs, Mr Lau confirms that RLC waives the right to any further sum of money in respect of thecosts of joinder application pursuant to Order 62 rule 9C(1)(b) of the RHC.
