Limitation of liability under the ECB</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  There is no dispute that the type of carriage involved in this case was what the ECB calls a âcombined transportâ.  In thisrespect, insofar as material, the ECB provides as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>17(B).    Combined Transport</b></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">1.1) The Carrier shall be liable for loss or damage to the Goods occurring between the time when the Carrier received the Goods intoits charge and the time of delivery.</p>            <p class="quote">2)    The Carrier shall, however, be relieved of liability for any loss or damage if such loss or damage arose or resulted from:</p>            <p class="quote">...</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">k)    any other cause or event which the Carrier could not avoid and the consequences whereof it could prevent by the exercise ofreasonable diligence.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="quote">....</p>            <p class="quote">11.   Notwithstanding anything provided for in other clauses of these Conditions, if it can be proved where the loss or damage occurred,the Carrier and the Merchant shall, as to the liability of the Carrier be entitled to require such liability to be determined bythe provisions contained in any International Convention or National Law which provisions</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">i) cannot be departed from by private contract to the detriment of the claimant, and</p>                <p class="quote">ii)    would have applied (if the Merchant had made a separate and direct contract with the Carrier in respect of the particular stageof transport where the loss or damage occurred and received as evidence thereof any particular document which must be issued if suchInternational Convention or National Law shall apply.</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>18.   Limitation Amount</b></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">18.1 When the Carrier is liable for compensation in respect of loss or damage to the Goods, such compensation shall be calculatedby reference to the invoice value of the Goods plus freight charges and insurance if paid.</p>            <p class="quote">18.2 If there be no invoice value of the Goods, the compensation shall be calculated by reference to the value of such Goods at theplace and time they are delivered to the Merchant in accordance with the contract or should have been so delivered.  The value ofthe Goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of theGoods of the same kind and quality.</p>            <p class="quote">18.3 If in case of Combined Transport it can contrary to 17(B) II above not be proved where the loss or damage occurred compensationshall not exceed US$2.â per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damage unless a higher compensation is provided by applicablecompulsory law.</p>            <p class="quote">If it can be proved where the loss or damage occurred and if no compulsory law applies, compensation shall not exceed US$2.â perkilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged.</p>            <p class="quote">18.4 Higher compensation may be claimed only when, with the consent of the Carrier, the value of the Goods declared by the Merchanthas been stated in the Bill of Lading and the ad valorem freight rate is paid to the Carrier.  In that case the amount of the declaredvalue shall be substituted for the limits laid down in this clause.  Any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on thebasis of such declared value.</p>            <p class="quote">18.5 The Carrier shall not, in any case, be liable for an amount greater than the actual loss to the person entitled to make the claim.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The principal submission of Ms. Janet Ho (appearing for ECT) is that ECT is entitled to rely on the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of ECB cl.18.3.  She suggests that ECT is so entitled by reason of ECB cl.1.3 which defines the expression âCarrierâto include Transpacâs âagents, servants and subcontractorsâ.  If cl.18.3 applies, then the Plaintiffs would only be entitledto damages of US$24,392 (that is, US$2 per kg. x 12,196 kgs.).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  I shall assume that Ms. Ho is right in reading âCarrierâ as encompassing ECT.  Even then, I do not think that the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of cl.18.3 is sufficiently unambiguous to cover the present situation.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  First, it is unclear whether the words âloss or damageâ in the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) only refer to loss or damage occasioned through no-fault of a Carrier; or,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) also extend to loss or damage occasioned through the Carrierâs negligence, recklessness or deliberate fault.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It would be remarkable if, where a Carrier was at fault through negligence or recklessness, the Carrier could limit its compensationto a sum which has no bearing to the actual value of the goods lost or damaged.  Here, for instance, the US$2 per kg limitation inthe 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph produces a compensation which is derisory in relation to the actual value of the goods lost.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Despite cl.18.1 which refers to compensating a party by reference to the invoice value of goods lost or damaged, could the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>paragraph of cl.18.3 really be clawing back on cl.18.1 by only offering a minimal sum even when the Carrier is at fault?  It is possible. But, given the principle of reading a contract <i>contra preferentem</i>, much clearer words would need to be inserted into cl.18.3 before the Court can construe the provision as having the effect for whichMs. Ho contends.  Ambiguities in the clause are to be construed against the Carrier seeking to rely on the same.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Therefore, just read in isolation, cl.18.3 does not seem wide enough to cover the situations where loss or damage has been causedthrough the negligence or recklessness of a Carrier.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Second, cl.18.3 cannot be read in isolation.  The conclusion just reached above is confirmed (at least as far as recklessness isconcerned) by ECB cl.23.2.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Cl.23.2 states that the Carrier:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âshall not be entitled to the benefit of limitation of liability provided for in clause 18.3, if it is proved that the loss or damageresulted from an act or omission of the Carrier itself done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damagewould probably resultâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In my previous Judgment, I indicated that I thought that ECT through its employee Jimmy was not just negligent, but reckless inignoring its own internal procedure.   That remains my view.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Jimmy ought to have checked that Container X had been transferred from ECTâs barge system to its trucking system.  Because ofthe volume of containers having to be processed at the time, Jimmy did not so check.  He took a short-cut and simply re-routed ContainerX to the trucking system.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  ECT must have envisaged that there would be a probable risk of misdelivery in such situations.  Otherwise, why did its internalprocedures require a check?  ECT did not adduce evidence suggesting that Jimmy was unaware of the risk of misdelivery involved indoing what he did or that ECT was oblivious to the real possibility of misdelivery if the internal procedure of a check was not followed.  In those circumstances, the Court can be bold and presume that ECT must have been fully aware of a probable (and I believe self-evident)risk of misdelivery to an unauthorised person if no check with its barging system staff was undertaken.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It appears that short-cuts similar to that which Jimmy took were routinely taken by ECT staff without mishap in the past.  But thatslack practice was only postponing the inevitable day when the obvious risk of misdelivery to an unauthorised person would materialise. That ECT got away with slackness in the past does not make what it did less reckless.  The evidence is that, not surprisingly, sincethe events of the present case ECT has modified its procedures.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Third, I do not read the expression of an exception to cl.18.3 in cl.23.2 as implying that negligence by the Carrier is coveredby the limitation in cl.18.3.  The more plausible reading of cl.23.2 is that it merely emphasises that cl.18.3 does not cover theextremely serious situation where the Carrier has been reckless.  In other words, I do not think that this is a situation of <i>expressio unius exclusio alterius</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  If cl.18.3 was truly meant to cover fault situations (such as negligence), one would at least expect comprehensive expressions suchas âloss or damage whatsoeverâ or âloss or damage howsoever arisingâ to appear in the provision.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Ms. Ho refers me to cl.17(B)(2)(k) which excludes liability for âloss or damageâ due to some unavoidable cause or event âtheconsequences whereof [the Carrier] could not prevent by the exercise of reasonable diligenceâ.  She suggests that since, by cl.17(B)(2)(k)the Carrier is absolved of liability altogether where it is not at fault, cl.18.3 must at least have been intended to operate inthe different situation where the Carrier is at fault by reason of negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I am unable to accept this argument.  In particular, I do not think that cl.17(B)(2)(k) absolves liability in all no-fault situations. Clause 17(B)(2)(k) seems to me only to concern situations of frustration or <i>force majeure</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Where there is âloss or damageâ due to such unavoidable circumstances, the Carrier is not to be liable.  The expression âtheconsequences whereof [the Carrier] could not prevent by the exercise of reasonable diligenceâ merely stresses that the relevant<i>force majeure</i> event must be truly unavoidable or unforeseeable.  I do not think that cl.17(B)(2)(k) goes so far as to absolve a Carrier in allsituations where there has been a lack of fault on the Carrierâs part, even in the absence of frustration or <i>force majeure</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Thus, for example, conversion is a tort of strict liability.  One might commit conversion innocently, despite having taken all reasonablecare, by (say) surrendering cargo to a fraudster who has presented a skilfully forged bill of lading.  I do not think that on itswording cl.17(B)(2)(k) excludes the Carrierâs liability in such case wherethere is no question of <i>force majeure</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It follows that cl.18.3 may possibly simply apply to no-fault situations (such as the one just posited) which are not covered bycl.17(B)(2)(k).</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In summary, ECT having been not just negligent but also reckless, cl.18.3 does not apply to limit its liability to the Plaintiffs. Even if I were wrong about ECT having been reckless, I would still decline to treat cl.18.3 as limiting liability where (as here)ECT has at the very least been negligent.</p>    <p class="heading">B.  Limitation under the Hapag Lloyd Sea Waybill</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Transpac shipped the Plaintiffsâ containers (including Container X) from Shanghai to Rotterdam through Transpacâs agents KuehneNagel.  Kuehne Nagel engaged Hapag Lloyd for the voyage and received a Sea Waybill as evidence of the contract of carriage.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Sea Waybill cl.5(1) provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Port to Port Shipment</b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) When loss or damage has occurred between the time of loading of the Goods by the Carrier at the Port of Loading and the time ofdischarge by the Carrier at the Port of Discharge, the responsibility of the Carrier shall be determined in accordance with Germanlaw, making the Hague-Visby Rules compulsorily applicable to a Bill of Lading....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) Howsoever the Carrier shall be under no liability whatsoever for loss of or damage to the Goods occurring, if such loss or damagesarises prior to loading on or subsequent to the discharge from the vessel....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">....â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the alternative, Ms. Ho submits that ECT is entitled to rely on cl.5(1)(b) of the Sea Waybill.  She says that this is possibleby reason of a Himalaya clause found in cl.4 of the Sea Waybill.  On that basis, the misdelivery of Container X having taken placeafter its discharge from the vessel in Rotterdam, Ms. Ho contends that ECT is not liable for anything at all.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Sea Waybill cl.4 confers on the Carrierâs agents or bailees the benefit of exemptions and limitations accorded to the Carrierby the Sea Waybill.  I shall assume for the purposes of argument that cl.4 allows ECT to rely on provisions in the Sea Waybill. Despite that, I do not think that cl.5(1)(b) applies to give ECT the wholly surprising result of total immunity from liability. Whatever it might mean, cl.5(1)(b) cannot be conferring total immunity for any loss howsoever caused following discharge.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Cl.5(1)(b) needs to be read in the context of the Sea Waybill as a whole.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Sea Waybill cl.3(2) provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a)   The Goods ... will be delivered after payment of freight and other charges to the consignee, or to such person who identifieshimself as being a representative of the consignee, and such delivery shall constitute the performance of this contract.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) The Carrier shall be under no liability for wrong delivery if he can prove that he has exercised reasonable care to ascertainthat the party claiming delivery is in fact entitled.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Logically, delivery to a consignee must follow discharge from a vessel.  Since cl.3(2)(b) provides that the Carrier is liable formisdelivery where it has not âexercised reasonable care to ascertain that the party claiming delivery is in fact entitled,â cl.5(1)(b)(whatever it might mean) cannot be granting immunity in such situation.  Notwithstanding its apparently wide wording, cl.5(1)(b)must have a significantly more restricted ambit.  On pain of contradiction and incoherence, the Carrier cannot rely on cl.5(1)(b)to cut down on the plain meaning of cl.3(2).</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  It is unclear just what the restricted ambit of cl.5(1)(b) was intended to be.  But for the purposes of these proceedings, it isnot necessary to determine the termâs scope.  That is because here (as already discussed) ECT did not take all reasonable careto ascertain that Nico was entitled to receive Container X on the Plaintiffsâ behalf.  On the contrary, ECT acted recklessly inreleasing Container X without first checking with its barge system personnel.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr. Edward Alder (appearing for the Plaintiffs) observes that, insofar as cl.5(1)(b) purports to absolve ECT of liability altogether,it should have been (but was not) raised in the course of ECTâs application to set aside the interlocutory judgment on liability. It is now (Mr. Alder urges) too late to rely on cl.5(1)(b).  While I agree with Mr. Alderâs submission, I have nonetheless dealtwith the merits of ECTâs cl.5(1)(b) argument for the sake of completeness.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Cl.5(1)(b) is not applicable to the present circumstances.</p>    <p class="heading">III. CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  ECTâs submissions for a reduced assessment of quantum fail.  There will be judgment in the Plaintiffâs favour for the invoicevalue of the goods in Container X (Euros 950,071.20).  As insurer, Mitsui Sumitomo (the 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff) paid the invoice value of the goods plus a 10% uplift by way of compensation for the lost Sony Play Stations.  The rationalebehind the 10% uplift is unclear on the evidence.  I therefore am not able to award more than the invoice value of the goods. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I will now hear the parties on interest, costs and consequential orders.</p>    <p>   </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(A.
