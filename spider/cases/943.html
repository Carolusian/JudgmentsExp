It was expressly stated in the letter that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The D and B offer is made on an assumption of 13 months' work. It is our intention to speed up the progress to cut-short the contractperiod wherever possible. Wai Kee shall provide necessary mucking and hauling equipment to clear the muck fast."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This letter of offer was verbally accepted by Wai Kee on 16 September 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It was further provided as a term and condition of the agreement in the tender letter that the initial mobilization fee of $1.5 millionwas requested to be paid to Happy Dynasty during contract signing. It was stated under drilling and blasting fee that there shouldbe one-off equipment mobilization/demobilization costs of $100,000. Mobilization would be made within 10 days, i.e. upon paymentof the mobilization fee.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In fact, the mobilization fee was not paid until after 30 December 1992. But Happy Dynasty had already been mobilized and ready tobegin drilling at least by 4 November 1992. The revised programme of 28 October 1992 shows the D and B works should start on 1 November1992. This seems to be the best and accepted date to use as the starting date.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The contract could not be finished within 13 months i.e. at the end of November 1993. Instead it continued on and could only be completedby 28 May 1995. It is common ground between the parties that by the time the contract was completed, it was 31 months already.</p>    <p class="heading">Was the contract rate applicable for 13 months only?</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The first issue to be decided is whether the contract rate of $12.69/m( would only be applicable for the 13 months up to the endof November 1993. In this respect there is one further complication apart from the construction of the first term and condition ofthe letter of 7 September 1992. The parties were aware at the time of the original subcontract Wai Kee would enter into a joint venturewith other parties in establishing a new company instead of Wai Kee as a subcontractor of LEJV. This was the 3rd Defendant ("HugeHost"), an engineering limited company which was incorporated in March 1993. It formally entered into the subcontract with LEJV.Thereafter by a sub-subcontract dated 6 July 1993, Happy Dynasty entered into a formal subcontract with Huge Host again for the sameD and B works. This D and B subcontract works provided that Happy Dynasty was to carry out the works in accordance with the principalcontractor's programme as revised from time to time. There are provisions in this subcontract that it was intended to be "back toback" with the principal subcontract and I do not want to repeat all of them here : they are in GCC 3, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 59 and63.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> However the letter of 7 September 1992 was expressly incorporated in and appended to the subcontract and the subcontract itself hasno provision for rate. In other words, the only provision for rate of $12.69/m( which specifically stipulated that it would applyfor 13 months was in the said letter incorporated into the formal subcontract.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In this respect I accept the Plaintiff's submission that the letter which was incorporated into the subcontract provided clearlythe contract rate would only apply for 13 months albeit Happy Dynasty had an obligation to follow the programme of the principalcontract beyond 13 months from whence onward the rate would no longer apply. Before I consider what rate would then apply and whatis the legal consequence thereof, I would have to consider the effect of this formal subcontract dated 6 July 1993.</p>    <p class="heading">The formal subcontract</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> By the time the subcontract was signed by Happy Dynasty with Huge Host, the D and B works had already begun. In signing the subcontract,Happy Dynasty was willing to enter into a formal subcontract with Huge Host to continue on the D and B works with a new entity forthe same works which it had previously agreed with Wai Kee, bearing in mind that Wai Kee was one of the party in establishing HugeHost.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> By the same token, Huge Host was willing to enter into this subcontract with Happy Dynasty and accepted the terms and conditionsas stated in the letter of 7 September 1992, by incorporating the same in its subcontract. In so doing Huge Host also accepted thatthe rate would only be applicable for 13 months since the commencement of the works up to November 1993. There was no provision forany other rate. Accordingly, even when the subcontract was intended to be a back to back subcontract with the principal contractand Happy Dynasty was duty bound to perform the subcontract beyond the 13 months period, there was no agreement as to what rate wouldhave by then onwards applied.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> As from 6 July 1993 Happy Dynasty carried out work for and at the direction of Huge Host, requested Huge Host to pay it and was paidby it. Thus I find that Huge Host had assumed the contractual obligations of Wai Kee which was anticipated and accepted by HappyDynasty by signing the subcontract document. However Wai Kee continued to be involved, <em>inter alia</em>, in making promises that they had included delays to Happy Dynasty's works in their claim to LEJV (e.g. letter dated 16 June 1994).The satisfaction letter of 22/24 May 1995 was signed by Wai Kee. Accordingly, in the absence of any express provision defining theposition of Wai Kee and Huge Host after the formal subcontract, the parties had by their conduct accepted that both Wai Kee and HugeHost were the subcontracting parties with Happy Dynasty. This is so in spite of the fact that Mr Law of Happy Dynasty acknowledgedthis in Happy Dynasty's letter dated 3 January 1995 to Wai Kee in which he wrote that "Our contract is with Huge Host Engineeringnot with you". In other words both the 1st and 3rd Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Is the Plaintiff entitled to Quantum Meruit?</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The Plaintiff pleaded in its statement of claim that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If the work took not a maximum of 13 months but very substantially more than 13 months through no fault of the Plaintiff the contractualrates were not applicable but the Plaintiff would be paid a fair and reasonable remuneration based inter alia upon the actual timetaken to complete the contractual works."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Harris, Counsel for the Defendants submitted that a term will only imply if it is required to give efficacy to the agreement orit is obviously to be inferred into the agreement. In <strong>D. P. Refinery (Westerport) Pty Limited v. The Shire of Hastings</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=16%20ALR%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">16 ALR 363</a>, the Privy Council had provided a useful test to be applied in determining whether or not a term should be implied. At p.376 LordSimon, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council, says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In their view, for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1. it must be reasonable and equitable;</p>        <p class="quote">2. it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective withoutit;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3. it must be obvious that 'it goes without saying';</p>        <p class="quote">4. it must be capable of clear expression;</p>        <p class="quote">5. it must not contradict any express term of the contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was submitted by the Defendants that none of these criteria are satisfied by the implied term pleaded by Happy Dynasty. I howeverdisagree.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I have already accepted that in the subcontract, albeit a back to back contract in the sense that Happy Dynasty cannot cease to continueon with the works after 13 months, the contractual rate was only applicable in clear and express term, for 13 months only. It mustbe reasonable and equitable and also obvious in order to give business efficacy to the contract that after 13 months, Happy Dynastyis entitled to be paid at a reasonable rate if the contract is silent on the rate applicable after 13 months. This does not contradictany express term of the contract. It was open to the party to agree on the new term beforehand. They did not. It is therefore necessaryfor the Court to determine according to the circumstances of this case. After all, Wai Kee and Huge Host were paid $20 million ascompensation by LEJV for prolongation by way of settlement. This was not made known to the Plaintiff until during the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Before this settlement payment made by LEJV to Wai Kee and the completion of the works, Wai Kee said to Happy Dynasty :-</p>    <p>(a) in their letter dated 16 June 1994</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... our contract work at Tai Ho site has experienced serious delays ... naturally this situation has affected your subcontract works... we have included the consequent delays to your subcontract works as part of our claim to LEJV", and</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(b) in their letter dated 27 June 1994</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We appreciate that Happy Dynasty's quotation for the blasting work was based on a 13 month contract period ... should LEJV's claimagainst the Engineer be successful an additional payout shall be made on the basis of delays to your works".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>These letters are clear indication that Wai Kee there and then also considered that Happy Dynasty would be entitled to a reasonablesum for the delay.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr Graham, Counsel for the Plaintiff, submitted that the appropriate rate ought to be fixed by way of <em>quantum meruit</em> based upon a fair valuation of the work. In <em>Hudson's Building and Engineering Contract</em> 11 ed. Vol. 1, it was said that the expression "<em>quantum meruit</em>" :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... is frequently employed in two quite different legal contexts. On the one hand, it may be used where a true contractual situationexists in the sense of a request to do work accompanied by an intention to pay for it, and so supported by consideration but wherethe price may not have been fixed at all or with sufficient precision by the contract, so that a promise to pay a reasonable priceor remuneration requires to be implied to give practical effect to the parties' intentions. This is merely an application of therules as to implied terms ... and is not a case of quasi-contract. ... On the other hand, the expression may be used where no agreementexists, or subsequently comes into existence, but it would be unconscionable to allow one party to benefit from the work done orservices rendered by the other. This is true quasi-contractual quantum meruit ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I accept the Plaintiff's submission that the term <em>quantum meruit</em> is obviously used in the first sense as aforesaid. I also accept the Plaintiff's submission that the best way of establishing a fairand reasonable rate for month 14 onwards is by approaching the matter as one would in a traditional prolongation claim. There isno cleft between a "<em>quantum meruit</em> claim" (as the claim under paragraph 20 of the Statement of Claim has been called) and the "prolongation claim" under paragraph 20Aof the Statement of Claim. There are slightly different calculations based on the same approach.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr Michael Charlton, an expert called by the Plaintiff commented in his evidence that he regarded Mr Randolph Law's quantificationunder paragraph 20 of the Statement of Claim as "an attempt to calculate a fair price for those items which were the subject of delay.That seems to me to be the way it is being done, in fact, very similar to what I did." I accept his contention and I shall elaborateit under the consideration of "Quantum".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Before I consider what is the reasonable rate, I have to consider the submission of the Defence that the Plaintiff could not, asstated in its tender letter, finish the work within 13 months' time anyway. Thus, so submitted by the Defendants, the period fromwhich the contractual rate would cease to apply should not be calculated from the 14th month onwards.</p>    <p class="heading">Could the Plaintiff finish the work in 13 months?</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The letter of 7 September 1992 contained key technical figures. In particular in Assumption A it assumed that the development blastingwould last for 2 months, for November and December 1992. It provided that the number of rig to be used would be 1.397. Accordingto Mr Law, this could not in reality be the case since you cannot provide a fraction of a rig. This was used only for calculation.The amount of rock blasted would be 100,000 m(.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Thereafter for Production One period, i.e. for January and February 1993, the total volume of rock to be blasted would be 200,000m( and the number of rig to be provided, as a matter of calculation only, would be 1.222.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In respect of Production Two period i.e. from March to November 1993, as contained in Assumption B, the total volume of rock to beblasted would be 1,260,000 m(. The contractual time would be 9 months and the number of rig to be provided would be 1.01. The pricebreakdown on this tender letter provided that the unit rig for development blasting was $18.86/m( and for production blasting $12.26.Accordingly, for the total volume of 1,560,000 m( the average rate was $12.69/m(.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The Defence submitted that the Plaintiff could not have completed the work in 13 months time using the plant and manpower assumedin the tender. They calculated the total linear metre ("LM") to be drilled in the tender assumption and the actual linear metre drilledfor the whole work. It came to 64% more and thus they submitted that it required 64% more time in the D and B works.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> However the tender assumption, as a matter of calculation as I pointed out herein before, used only part of a rig which is not possiblein reality. The tender letter also stated at the outset that two rigs would be used. The Plaintiff's claim and the Plaintiff's quantificationof its claim presupposes that the tender assumption needs to be revised and compared the delay elements of carrying out the workin 13 months with two rigs and the delay elements of carrying out the work in 31 months using two rigs. In the cross-examinationof Mr Charlton, it was put to him that the Plaintiff could have done the job in 13 months but it would have needed 26 plant-months,not what he had assumed in the tender which is 15.2. Mr Charlton said his assessment did allow for two rigs on site for 13 monthsi.e. 26 plant-months. Even Mr Hawley, an expert called by the Defence, said drilling and blasting 1,560,000 m( with two rigs in 13months would ordinarily be an easily achievable target but in this case, because of the site specific factors, it would be necessaryto work overtime. However he declined to calculate by how much.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The tender assumption is drilling 418 m/day, 27 days/month for 11.5 months. Using the "yield" figure calculated by Mr Hawley, thatwould have produced 2,700,000 m( rock, i.e. 43% more than was required to be done under the contract. In other words, the tenderassumption itself has already allowed for 43% more drilling as a matter of cushioning.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Further and more importantly, the main factor in the additional drilling was changes in the blast pattern. The tender assumptionassumed that emulsion explosive would be used. However, the emulsion plant was shut down by the end of 1993 because of the extremeprolongation of the work. Mr Hawley also agreed with this. He agreed that the reversion from using emulsion explosive to heavy explosive/ANFOinvolved a change in the blast pattern and that the change in the blast pattern could have been because of the change in the explosiveused.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I accept the Plaintiff's evidence that the major cause of the 64% additional drilling was a tighter drilling pattern brought aboutby the forced abandonment of bulk emulsion method because of prolongation and that was just another <em>effect</em> of delay and ought to be ignored for the purposes of quantifying the Plaintiff's claim. In other words, I accept the Plaintiff'ssubmission that although the tender built up was for 280 LM (linear metre) per day during the production phase, it was in fact 1.22rigs at 280 LM/day/rig, i.e. 280 LM plus 22% more or 61.6 LM per day, giving a total of 341.16 LM/day. This figure of 1.22 rigs forproduction was adjusted up by Mr Robert Lloyd, an expert called by the Plaintiff, to two rigs as one cannot have 22% of a rig. MrCharlton then used two rigs as the basis of his quantification. The tender letter already stated that the Plaintiff would providetwo rigs and was thus entitled and bound to supply the same if necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In the end, I find that the Plaintiff could have finished the work in the ordinary course of such contract work if unhindered byany factor of delay. Thus I would have to consider what have caused the delay in the D and B works of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">Were the works prolonged beyond 13 months through no fault of the Plaintiff?</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The works meant the contract works of D and B and pre-splitting carried out as a separate item at $85/m<sup><sup><sup>3</sup></sup></sup> as well as substantial additional works. They were completed on 28 May 1995. In other words, it was 31 months from 1 November 1992as aforesaid.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The additional works included the rectangular channel, U-channel, utility trench, and underpass. The Plaintiff accepted that 3.5months of the total period may be regarded as having been spent on pre-splitting works as well as the additional works. The Defendants'case is that 3.5 months were spent on the additional works alone, i.e. excluding the pre-splitting works. I accept the Plaintiff'ssubmission for reasons which I shall discuss later on.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> On pleadings, apparently the Defendants' case in respect of delay which the Plaintiff has to meet was only those 11 days delay inMarch 1993 as pleaded in paragraph 27 of the counterclaim :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This [difficulty in the excavating rock] caused a delay to the 1st Defendant a period equivalent to 39% of March 1993 which the 1stDefendant has taken to be 11 days. The loss suffered by the 1st Defendant was as follows:"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> However the Defendants' opening described one of the triable issues as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Did the rates in the agreement between Happy Dynasty and Wai Kee and/or Huge Host apply if the works took 31 months rather than 13months to complete for reasons (<em>which is not conceded</em>) for which Happy Dynasty was not or not materially responsible?" (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Further Mr Gabiel Lam, the Defendants' expert also attempted to argue that the Plaintiff's drilling rigs were at all times fullyutilized and the additional 12.5 months needed to complete the drilling and blasting work:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"possibly arises because when preparing his tender the Plaintiff overlooked:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">i. the need to mobilize plants in six areas,</p>        <p class="quote">ii. the fact that little drilling will be carried out during blasting,</p>        <p class="quote">iii. the number of manpower assigned,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">iv. the necessity to start drilling and blasting simultaneously in some areas ... another fact to consider is the productivity ofthe drilling plant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In other words it was contended by Mr Lam that the prolongation was <em>caused</em> by an insufficiency of resources supplied by the Plaintiff. However, this line of argument in his statement was abandoned by Mr Lamwhen he gave his oral evidence. When Mr Harris, Counsel for the Defendants, put to him, he agreed that with the exception of a periodin March 1993, the Defendants were not suggesting that there was any significant delay caused to the excavation works by Happy Dynastythemselves.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The major causes of delay which, in my view, were abundantly established from the evidence and documents before me, might be summarizedas follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) delay in hand over of seawalls;</p>        <p>(2) delays in building seawalls once they were commenced;</p>        <p>(3) delays in reclamation works which were to be the dumping ground for OTR (other than rock);</p>        <p>(4) consequential upon (3) above, delays in OTR removal;</p>        <p>(5) delays in the reclamation works having the knock on effect of causing delays in access to other working areas available to LEJV/WaiKee/Happy Dynasty;</p>        <p>(6) problems caused to programming and planning of works in particular having regard to peak rock demand caused by the above;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7) lack of stock piling areas for OTR and rock;</p>        <p>(8) incidental causes such as breakdown of plant; lack of grizzly facilities and other sources of disruption, including failure tomuck out blasted faces quickly enough; and the need to revert to more labour intensive high explosive/ANFO blasting after 13 months.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The specific causes of prolongation are not material to the Plaintiff's case save that it is necessary only for the Plaintiff toshow that the causes of delay were not attributable to the faults of Happy Dynasty. In view of the concessions put by Counsel forthe Defendants to Mr Gabiel Lam, detailed consideration of all these matters of delay is now not necessary. I would just state afew salient features of the evidence accepted by me.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The Defendants admitted there were frequent machinery breakdowns. Mr William Zen of Wai Kee acknowledged "more breakdowns than normal"of their machineries. Mr Mok Ka Ian of Wai Kee said "it is true that our bulldozers broke down on many occasions."</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Although it was denied by Wai Kee with some indignation that they had "manipulated" rock production to avoid double handling at timeswhen demand for rock for the seawalls was low, it was, in my view, amply supported by the evidence, e.g. the site meeting minutefor 8 June 1993.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Further, Mr Mok also admitted that if the seawall had been held up so that he could not put the grade 700 rock on the seawall. Ashe did not want to stock pile, the only thing he could do was cut down his production of rock. Mr Hawley also agreed that "generallyI would say a delay in the end product definitely delays the mucking out".</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The evidence quite clearly showed that the pace at which Happy Dynasty could execute his works was entirely dictated by Wai Kee andLEJV. Many instances of delays, e.g. by the failure to muck out, low rock requirement etc, are recorded in the site meeting minutes.Mr Mok was cross-examined at some length on these minutes, and eventually he admitted the aforesaid.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In Wai Kee's letter of 12 November 1992 they wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Because of delay of marine works by LEJV, the usage of rock, for seawall construction from excavation was limited. We do not encourageyou to bring some more plants to the site at this stage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Further, Wai Kee had acknowledged in their letter of 24 December 1993 that the contract works had been delayed due to delays in thehandover of sections of works from LEJV, in particular the handover of sections of seawall. Mr Ken Yau of Wai Kee also said in hiswritten statement that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Delays of about 2 months has started to occur to the construction of seawall from around November 1992, and it was quite clear tome that there would be a knock-on delay to Happy Dynasty's works."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Ken Yau tried to resile from this position in his oral evidence. Mr Mok also tried to take a similar stand that one of LEJV's othersubcontractors, in delaying the marine works, could not have delayed Happy Dynasty. The letters of Wai Kee dated 24 December 1993and 16 June 1994, however, plainly acknowledged that delays were caused to the drilling and blasting by delays to the seawall andreclamation. The position could be summarized by what Mr Neil Hodge, the project manager of LEJV, said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I can only repeat: my position was that the China Fijian dredging delayed the excavation works, so I guess I could say that HappyDynasty would be delayed along with that."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In short, the delay or prolongation was not caused by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In the end I reach the firm conclusion that the delay in the drilling and blasting works of the Plaintiff was through no fault ofthe Plaintiff. Before I consider the quantum, as a consequence of the prolongation, I shall consider the two items of counterclaimof the Defendants first.</p>    <p class="heading">First counterclaim ( Was there delay equivalent to 11 days to the works in March 1993?</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The Defendants' first counterclaim contained two elements, namely :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>a. "... by necessary implication" there was a term in the contract that blasting would be carried out by a method and/or using explosiveswhich would result in sufficient "heave" to allow the rock that had been blasted to be excavated by the 1st Defendants;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>b. or alternatively there was a "duty of care" on the part of the Plaintiff to produce "sufficient heave".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The second point could be disposed of quickly. In a contract to provide services, there is no room to import duties or obligationsover and above the contract by means of a "duty of care" ( see Lord Scarman in <strong>Tai Hing Ltd v. Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd</strong>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] AC 80.</a> In <em>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Negligence</em> 1-54[32](ix) it has been said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"where parties have entered into a contract defining their obligations the law of tort will not generally impose any wider duties."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> There is no room for the "necessary implication" as contended by the Defendants. The contract was being carried out using the typeof explosives intended by the contracting parties as stated in the said tender letter of 7 September 1992. If what is intended bythe "necessary implication" is that every cubic metre of rock calculated according to the blast design was to be muckable withoutany secondary blasting, that is, as submitted by the Plaintiff, plainly wrong. It was not disputed that secondary blasting of toeswhich had not fragmented properly was a relatively common occurrence. Even Mr Ken Yau of the Defendant was at pains to explain inthe context of payment of invoices that the amount of rock theoretically produced by a blast was never in fact produced. His explanationwas fortified by a drawing on the white board. He said the difference between the blast design and the surveyed amount would, atthe end of the month, become :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" A very big sum ... . That is the reason why we could not base the blast design to calculate and we had to base on the actual surveydesign to do the calculations. There would be a discrepancy between survey quantity and the quantity shown in the blast design ...".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Thus it would not be correct in the first counterclaim which presupposed that 113,262 m( of rock had actually been blasted but 69,143m( removed would amount to proof that the balance was unmuckable.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> There was no contractual obligation to produce any particular quantity of muckable rock per month or per blast. Mr Charlton's comment(which evidence I accept) was that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... one has to look at the basis on which the Plaintiff tendered. As I recall there was no indication as to the way in which theblasting would allow the mucking out to be done in the terms of efficiency. That is to say, if they found it difficult to removecertain of the rock that had been blasted then so be it, that is the way the rock happens to work out when you blast it ... the blastingfigures fluctuated considerably month by month and there was no prediction on what those figures were actually going to be, and thereforeno prediction on what the mucking out figure ... is going to be. So to suggest that in one month, because you could only remove 69,000and 44,000 had to remain, you have incurred a loss when, in any event, you had no clear indication as to what that figure would bein the first place, it lacks a bit of logic to me ... It seems that the only obligation that was imposed was to actually muck itout so as to allow the blasting to proceed. The reverse was not the case, that the blasting would be carried out so as to allow themucking out to go at a certain rate ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In fact as shown by the Defendant's document, the monthly rock excavation record, March 1993 was by far the best month up until thatdate and was only surpassed by seven subsequent months: May, July, September, October, November, December 1993 and July 1994. Thefact that all other of the 30 months record on the Defendants' vertical bar chart produced less mucked rock than March 1993 highlightsthe fallacy of the contention that the volume of rock mucked in that month delayed the excavation works overall by 11 days and causedthe Plaintiff's damages in the sum of $1,807,566. The Plaintiff's contractual obligation was to drill and blast 1,560,000 m( of rockin 13 months or less, not to drill or blast any particular volume in any particular month.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> I also accept the Plaintiff's submission that in respect of the "necessary implication" argument, in the case of many kinds of contractsfor the provision of expert services, it has been held that the contractual obligation is not (in the absence of any express provision)to achieve any particular result but to serve the client with reasonable skill and care :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... apply this to the employment of a professional man. The law does not usually imply a warranty that he will achieve the desiredresult but only a term that he will use reasonable skill and care ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(Lord Denning M.R. in <strong>Greaves &amp; Co.

There were also contemporaneouscomplaints by Happy Dynasty that shot rock left on the ground was reducing payments to which they would otherwise be entitled. Anydelay in fact caused by March 1993, if any, was obviously subsumed or overtaken by subsequent delays. It has not been shown thatany delays in March 1993 were critical path delays or a limiting factor in the delay in view of concurring causes of delay.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Accordingly, the Defendants failed in their first counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">The second counterclaim ( The cause of remedial work to the railway cutting at Ngau Tau Kok Ch. 13600-13856</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> I accept the Plaintiff's submissions that counterclaim cannot succeed for a number of different reasons herein below.

The Defendants originally seemed to accept that.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The case for the Defendants was that this blasting work was done in July 1995 and thus not covered by the letter of 22/24 May 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Mr Law of the Plaintiff did not accept that the work was done in or about July 1995. He said categorically in cross-examination thatall blasting works were completed by 22 May 1995 at Ngau Tau Wan. Thereafter, Happy Dynasty did not have any blasting licence inthat area any more. He had done other blasting with LEJV in July 1995 in another area which had nothing to do with this area in NgauTau Wan. I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Mr Mok of the Defendants said he was satisfied with the bulk blasting at the time he signed the letter.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> The Plaintiff's case was that there was some damage to the slope in the vicinity of Ch. 13600-13850 of Ngau Tau Kok Railway cuttingbut this was not attributable to the faults of Happy Dynasty as witnessed by the said letter of 24 May 1995. Wai Kee had submitteda claim to LEJV on the basis that "geological conditions" had been responsible for the overbreak of Ngau Tau Kok railway cutting.In Happy Dynasty's letter of 22 September 1995 it said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... most of the rock structure .... is highly weathered .... HDL was instructed to blast according to your setting out into the topof the slope by 1m for 0.6m depth .... no sub-drilling was carried out for the blasting within the damage rock zone .... Bulldozerwas used to clear the slope and rip the top of the upper bench .... No backhoe was used for trimming."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> This letter had already raised at the time long before litigation was contemplated, the points made by Mr Chan Kam Sing of HappyDynasty in his evidence in that the holes along the platform had been drilled 1 metre deeper at the express request of Mr Mok, butthat there had been no sub-drill on the soft slope edge.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The situation on site at that time was also supported by the site meeting minutes of 19 April 1995 which said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Ngau Tau Kok .... Mok reported that 2 of our 3 loaders were broken down yesterday and it would affect our works progress seriouslyif this matter cannot be resolved immediately .... Critical work at Ngau Tau Kok could not be delayed by whatever means at this momentdue to the huge amount of L.D. [liquidated damages]...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Mr Roger Keller, a blasting expert called by the Plaintiff said it is not uncommon for the mucking contractors to request the drillingsub-contractors to slightly over-subdrill in order to make their mucking easier. With 2 out of 3 loaders out of action, and a possibleclaim for "huge" amount of liquidated damages looming, it is more probable that Mr Mok had requested Mr Chan Kam Sing to over-sub-drill1 metre deeper.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> It is also in this context that the platform was ripped by a bulldozer which broke the crest of the slope. It is also apparent fromthe photographs at B2.1, p.241 3A &amp; 3B that damage to the slope was not caused by blasting but over-enthusiastic mucking outin weak geological conditions. I do not accept the Defendants' evidence that these photographs are actually a few metres away fromthe damage in question.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> In any event, the evidence showed beyond any dispute that Wai Kee and the engineer were responsible for checking the blast designsand checking the drilling before blasting to ensure that it conforms to the blast design. They were charged with the duty of overseeingthe blasting operations. Mr Ken Yau of Wai Kee said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My job was to discuss with Happy Dynasty the depth, diameter and spacing of the holes ... Happy Dynasty would drill the holes. Thenthere would be an inspection with Happy Dynasty ... LEJV ... the Engineer (Mott McDonald) and myself to check the holes were drilledin accordance with the specification."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In the end I accept the evidence of the Plaintiff's witnesses and rejected that of the Defendants. I find there was a request forover-subdrilling by one metre deeper. The letter of 22/24 May 1995 is binding on both Wai Kee and Huge Host. They were in fact atthat time satisfied with the blasting works completed on 22 May 1995 in Ngau Tau Wan area.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> For the sake of completeness, I also accept the Plaintiff's submission that if I find the Plaintiff liable under the second counterclaim,upon the Defendants' admission and the evidence of Mr Charlton, deductions would have to be made in respect of savings of the excavationof concrete u-channel and the forming of the u-channel.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> I shall deal with each item of quantum with those uncontroversial items first herein below.</p>    <p>(1) <em>Underpayment for excavated rock</em></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> The LEJV final survey shows that total blasted volume of blasted and mucked rock was 1,570,322.40 m(.

The Plaintiff acceptedthe old rate applied to avoid complication. On the other hand, this amount and liability are admitted by the Defendants as due andowing subject to the Defendants' counterclaims.</p>    <p>(2) <em>Underpayment of amount in Invoice No. 23</em></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Invoice No. 23 was wrongly invoiced for $1,124,710.

However in William Zen'sstatement he says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Having discussed the matter with my Project Manager Mr Chan, I agree that this amount of $411,180 needs to be brought into accountin the claims of Happy Dynasty and the counterclaim of my joint venture."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In other words subject to the counterclaim of the Defendants, this item is due and owing.</p>    <p>(4) <em>Quantification of payment for month 14 onwards</em></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> This is the main claim of the Plaintiff:</p>    <p align="left">(i) Mr Charlton's report (B3.1 p.340) reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3.7 H.D. believe they have a valid sub-contract (the letter of September 1992) but the contract rate is no longer applicable becauseof the extent of the overrun."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3.8 ... it is not correct to take the opportunity to reprice the entire sub-contract or indeed to deny the contractor his profitrecovery which would be obtained in the absence of delay (e.g. in variation works)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> In Mr Charlton's evidence (see transcript Day 13 p.70) he said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If there was no rate available on which to base the core value of the work ... you would have to look at the quantum meruit as atotal cost with no rate on which to base it ... you would have no choice but to try to calculate the total cost expended ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and at pp.91-92:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"one has the cost information available from Happy Dynasty on which to base the calculation ... if the actual costs were obviouslyexcessive or unreasonable, then you would not".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Further in his report he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"4.1 it is necessary to ascertain what the costs would be had the contract been completed in 13 months."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"4.3 the actual costs/month are very much higher than the budgetted rates ... rig costs are much higher but ... there were 2 rigsused throughout ... the first step is to adjust the bill rate and increase the costs of the budget in respect of delayed elements."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(ii) I accept the Plaintiff's submission that the effect of this is that where one has a rate from which to start (and in many <em>quantum meruit</em> situations there will not be) one starts from the rate unless the rate is unreasonable or excessive. It does not matter what therate was as long as the work could have been done in 13 months with the resources that have been used for calculating what the workwould have cost to complete in 13 months.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> In his evidence Mr Charlton also said on Day 14 p.15:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If Mr Law would have lost money in 13 months that is a separate matter entirely and should not feature in the cost of the delay.Mr Law could have priced his rate at HK$2 instead of HK$12.69 and he still would have been entitled to HK$8 million costs ... forthe delay of 18 months."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(iii) <em>Appendix H</em></p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> This encapsulates Mr Charlton's comparison of the costs of doing the work in 13 months (the figures in Column A are "actual" in thesense that (except for explosives, which is necessarily a budget figure) they are the costs incurred over the 31 months divided by31 and multiplied by 13) compared with the costs of 31 months (which included a new explosives method caused by delay). In financialterms the difference between the costs of 31 months and 13 months less 3.5 months' costs for extra work amounted to HK$7,357,173as follows :-</p>    <table border="1" cellspacing="0"

months excludes pre-splitting : there was virtually no evidence on this subject. His contentions in paragraphs 38 and 39 of hisreport are not unconvincing. His conclusions were inaccurate on almost every other topic. I accept the Plaintiff's contention that3.5 months included pre-splitting.</p>    <p>(v) The effect of Gariel Lam's agreement is that if the Plaintiff establishes a right to adjust the contract rate or otherwise obtainfinancial compensation for the fact that the work was not completed in 13 months and a comparison between the additional costs oftime related items is held to be a fair and reasonable approach, then (subject possibly to the question of time for pre-splittingwhich has already been dealt with above) the Defendants' Q.S. expert agrees that HK$7,357,180 is the additional cost. This figurecan be, although it is unnecessary to do so, converted into an addition to the rate for month 13 onwards. Gabriel Lam said (at Day29 p.81) he agreed with Mr Charlton's approach to quantifying 3.5 months for variation works. At Day 30 p.21 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I agree with the basic principles of Mr Charlton..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Mr Randolph Law's quantification (para. 20 Statement of Claim)</p>    <p>(i) Mr Law quantifies the additional cost of time related items at HK$8,619,900 (B1 p.38). Referring to Column 3, Mr Gabriel Lam saidhe agreed all the items except for shot-firer, driller, operators and drilling plant. He was initially taking the view that the costsof running 4 rigs should be set out in Column 3 because the method statement provided for 4 rigs.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> At Day 30 p.35 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"actually Happy Dynasty did spend this amount of money for the first 13 months of the work I will agree to that."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>[i.e. the figures in Column 3]</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> At page 50 (Day 30) he acknowledged that Column 3 was a calculation of the actual costs if the contract period had been for 13 months.</p>    <p>(ii) At Day 30 p.42 Gabriel Lam agreed that the method statement had been based upon a programme which had become obsolete beforethe works commenced. He did not seem to have been made aware previously of the 28 October 1992 programme.</p>    <p>(iii) Mr Charlton commented on Randolph Law's quantification (at Day 13 starting at p.16 onwards). He confirmed that Mr Law was attemptingto calculate a fair price for those items which were the subject of delay</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"in fact, very similar to what I did."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> In dealing with the difference between his figures and Randolph Law's, the most obvious was his non-allowance of HK$1.29 millionfor profit in the sense of lost opportunity profit. The Plaintiff accepts that there is no evidence of lost opportunity profit ascalculated by Mr Law and Mr Law's figure in para.20 can be reduced by HK$1,293,000 leaving a figure of HK$7,326,900. This is strikinglyclose to Mr Charlton's Appendix H calculation of $7,357,180. Mr Charlton's calculation of additional site running costs and headoffice overheads more or less balanced out with Randolph Law's calculation of management costs. The two quantifications as submittedby the Plaintiff, can be regarded as a cross check of one upon the other. I accept Mr Charlton's quantification and round it up to$7,357,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Accordingly the total amount of payment due to the Plaintiff is as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="56%">(1) underpayment</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="29%">$1,148,412.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="56%">(2) underpayment of Invoice 23: (rounded up to)</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="29%">$3,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="56%">(3) utility trench blasting: agreed</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="29%">$411,180.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="56%">(4) prolongation</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="29%"><u>$7,357,000.00</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="56%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="29%">$8,919,592.00</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> There shall be judgment in the sum of $8,919,592 for the Plaintiff against the 1st and 3rd Defendants.
