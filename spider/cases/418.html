He suspended the Mareva on an undertaking that the defendants' solicitors would provide securityfor the $650,000 covered by Mareva until the hearing of the inter parte summons. In due course this came before Woo, J. with anothermatter on 26 July 1994. It was adjourned to 29 July 1994. The hearing was further continued on 22 August 1994 when the parties agreedthat the Mareva injunction and the undertaking should be discharged but the hearing continued upon the costs related to the Marevainjunction. The hearing was concluded on 2 September 1994.</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's decision and the hearing</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The judge decided rightly that there is jurisdiction to award a Mareva injunction which takes into account the costs of the action.This is not challenged. It is correct but the occasions when the court will take into account the incidence of costs in fixing theamount to be frozen in a Mareva injunction are extremely limited. This is not one of them.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In order to determine the appropriate level of costs to be awarded in these Mareva proceedings the judge undertook a detailed enquiryinto the woeful history of the previous proceedings between these parties and associated parties.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It is sufficient to give some flavour of the previous proceedings by saying that they included the obtaining of a default judgmentafter bad service by post, followed by garnishee proceedings, a charging order on the defendants' flat, a payment into court afterthe garnishee order was stayed, the taking out of the money in court by the plaintiff on behalf of a company called Versatile and- a few days before the hearing by Woo, J. - orders by Deputy Judge Yeung setting aside the judgment, ordering the return of themoney and consolidating District Court proceedings and this action.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> That was the position at the time of the ex-parte Mareva application on 16 May 1994. Prior to the hearing before Woo, J. the 1stdefendant took out a summons for directions as the company (Versatile) had not repaid the money to her. Before this was heard byDeputy Judge Yeung on 23 May 1994 the plaintiff's firm filed a notice ceasing to act in a District Court action. They wrote to theRegistrar of the Supreme Court to say they acted for the company Versatile in the second District Court action and asked for a newHigh Court Action No. for the two actions when they were consolidated. Deputy Judge Yeung dealt with these matters firmly. He orderedcosts against Versatile on a full indemnity basis, that if Versatile failed to return the money it was to become a judgment debtand the 1st defendant was given leave to levy execution, the charging orders against the defendants' Shatin Property were to be removedfrom the Land Register and the plaintiff's firm's conduct was criticised.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Later Woo J explained the relevance of this history when he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I dwell on the Plaintiff's acts and conduct in the District Court proceedings in such details because they are part and partial [sic]of all the surrounding circumstances the consideration of which is required for making a decision on costs in this matter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Having reviewed the whole history of proceedings between the parties and the Mareva injunction the judge concluded not only that therehad been material non-disclosure but also that the Mareva proceedings had been undertaken for collateral motives and were not bonafide. He went on to pass serious strictures upon the whole conduct of the plaintiff in this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The context of the litigation was undoubtedly relevant to the issue before the judge. But the determination of motive and mala fideson affidavit evidence ought not have been undertaken. No doubt these issues will be determined at trial. With respect, therefore,the detailed examination of the history of the litigation, the motive and mala fides of the plaintiff as described on affidavitswas not sufficiently relevant and germane to the determination of the simple issue on costs to justify the detailed enquiry whichthe judge was persuaded to undertake. In these circumstances on appeal we encouraged the parties to limit themselves to the barefactual background of the litigation and to concentrate upon the Mareva application itself in order to determine whether the judgewas shown to be plainly wrong in making the order for costs on an indemnity basis.</p>    <p class="heading">The Mareva injunction</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is unnecessary to repeat what has been said many many times before. A Mareva injunction is a draconian order which if made unjustlycan cause incalculable damage to defendants. The order is one which should be regarded as unusual. It is designed for the preservationof assets in good commercial claims. As this court said in <strong>Tamco Electrical &amp; Electronic (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Ng Chung-fai Stephen</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20HKLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 HKLR 178</a> at 191 L41 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... these wholly exceptional orders were devised for use in rare and extreme cases."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> As the application is ex parte the duty on the party applying and its legal advisers is stringent. As Scott, J. said in <strong>Columbia Picture Industries Inc. v. Robinson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 38</a> - cited in Tamco at 192 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... since it was frequently accompanied by a Mareva injunction, it could have the effect that the defendant's business would be destroyedwithout the defendant being in a position to apply to the court for the order to be set aside before it was executed; that, therefore,applicants for an order of such severity were under a strict duty to make to the court a full and frank disclosure of all mattersthat could be relevant and, having obtained the order, neither to act oppressively, nor abuse their power in executing the order."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Further, there are two other matters relevant to this appeal. First, it is not a sufficient disclosure to put before the judge a pileof papers. He may not have the time to read them and to digest them in detail. It is the duty of legal advisers and counsel to callthe judge's attention to everything that he must see. <strong>Intergraph Corporation v. Solid System CAD Services Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1993%20FSR%20617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1993 F.S.R. 617.</a></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Secondly, the plaintiff must put before the judge the grounds for his claim, the amount of the claim and any obvious matters of factor law which could be raised by the defendant against the making of an order. As was said in Tamco at 191.6 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The court itself bears a heavy responsibility, which it must discharge in unusual circumstances, without the benefit of adversaryargument, and for just this reason the applicant's solicitors and counsel come under a duty to assist the judge so as to ensure,so far as possible, that the court does not make an order which perpetrates an injustice against the absent party."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The ex parte application</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The facts of this case speak adequately for themselves. The application was made on the following grounds;</p>    <p>(1) that there was a good arguable case likely to succeed on threat of assault, spraying paint on the door of an office, telephoningand coming to the office demanding to see the plaintiff and demanding the payment of money.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Leaving aside the strange pleading - at most this is a small claim on questionable grounds unlikely to succeed in the obtaining ofa permanent injunction. At best it can be said that the judge was prepared to make the ex parte order in spite of these matters.</p>    <p>(2) That there was a risk of the defendants' dissipating assets to avoid the consequences of the judgment against them. As the damagesin the case at most could amount to about $8,000, the risk of dissipation could only relate to costs of the action.</p>    <p>(3) On the evidence, costs had already been incurred by the plaintiff of about $320,000 and after trial would amount to $650,000.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> At the ex parte application the nature of the associated proceedings between Versatile and the 1st defendant were not disclosed tothe judge. The default judgment and its setting aside were not mentioned nor was the effect of this on the charging order which hadbeen made. For my part, I agree with the judge below that these matters should have been put before the court on the ex parte application.These were closely associated on the facts and with the persons involved. The plaintiff was under strict duty to disclose these matterswhich could be relevant so the judge could consider the context of the order which was sought. However, although the failure to disclosethese matters must have been deliberate, I am not prepared to say that there was a deliberate attempt to mislead the court. Havingregard to matters which follow I leave the point there.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Mareva injunction is designed to protect the plaintiff against the dissipation of assets against which he will execute judgment.It is not available to a plaintiff who simply seeks a declaration. See <strong>The Steamship Mutual Underrising Association (Bemuda) Ltd. v. Thkur Shipping Co. Ltd.</strong> [1986] 2 Lloyds Reports 439. Nor is it available to a plaintiff who seeks only a permanent injunction. It was therefore essentialin this ex parte application that the plaintiff stated the amount of her claim. She failed to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">The strength of the application</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The plaintiff's purported claims for "harassment" and "molestation" are misconceived. There are no such torts. If the plaintiff provesnuisance, a permanent injunction is unlikely. The monetary claim if successful is worth, on the plaintiff's case, only a few thousanddollars. The uncertain assumption that the plaintiff has a good arguable case for this sum puts the application in perspective. Ifthe principles are properly applied there ought to be no possible chance of obtaining a Mareva injunction for such a sum in an assault/nuisanceclaim such as this.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The evidence of risk of dissipation was that the defendants' proposed sale of their flat, the fact that the defendants are Singaporean(and therefore could return there if they so chose) coupled with the plaintiff's affirmed belief in risk of dissipation. Whereasthe plaintiff's case on this point was slim evidence of risk is often difficult to obtain and if the rest of the application wason firm ground the court's practice in the past (perhaps wrongly) has been to accept relatively weak evidence of risk if the otherevidence is strong.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiff did not seek a freezing of the assets for any prospective judgment sum but only in respect of costs. There was oneuntaxed order for costs against the defendant in previous proceedings but freezing was not sought in respect of this costs order.Freezing was sought (a) for the sum of $320,000 alleged to have been expended already in the action and (b) for $330,000 not yetincurred. In the court below, there was considerable argument as to whether the court had jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunctionin respect of costs alone. As I have said already the judge decided rightly that there is jurisdiction but with respect this is notthe real issue. The issue is whether this Mareva injunction ought ever to have been applied for, and if applied for, granted. Assumingeverything had been properly taken into consideration, was there any real chance of a judge granting the injunction had he a fullknowledge of the facts and the background?</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Here, the plaintiff was seeking an order in circumstances which in my experience are unique. Whereas parties should not be discouragedfrom seeking to advance the law by placing full and balanced legal argument before the court, as the Plaintiff was applying ex partethe duty here was to ensure that the judge was aware of the unique nature of the application. This was not done. The plaintiff cannotrely upon the fact that the judge granted the ex parte order nor that on the return date the judge was prepared to continue it.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> <em>The situation can be summarised in this way :</em></p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) There was a material non-disclosure.</p>        <p>(b) The unique nature of the application was not brought to the judge's attention in the following respects;</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) it was an non-commercial claim;</p>            <p>(ii) the chances of obtaining a permanent injunction were small;</p>            <p>(iii) the plaintiff was seeking protection for costs, most of which had not been incurred, and the rest of which - apart for a smalland unknown amount - was not the subject of any order;</p>            <p>(iv) the value of the claim was not disclosed to the judge and was only $8,000;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) That the defendants were in the process of selling their apartment, a Mareva injunction would prevent this, therefore the effectof the injunction was likely to be oppressive or at least severe.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In summary therefore the plaintiff's application for Mareva injunction was oppressive and misconceived. It succeeded because thefull circumstances of the facts and the law were not placed before the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In these circumstances I would hold without hesitation that the judge's order was correct. Although I would uphold his decision onrather different grounds in my judgment the order was the only proper one in the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I would dismiss the appeal and make an order nisi that the costs of the appeal should follow the event and be taxed and paid forthwith.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Liu, J.A.:</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The 1st defendant was the former Marketing Manager of Versatile Advertising Company Limited. I shall call it "Versatile". The 2nddefendant is her husband. The plaintiff is a solicitor and a former shareholder/director of Versatile. When the 1st defendant's employmentcontract with Versatile was terminated, her claim against her former employer was left outstanding, and friction was thereby causedbetween the 1st defendant and Versatile. Such friction was spilling over onto the plaintiff. Foul and abusive messages in red paintwere sprayed outside the offices of Versatile and the legal firm of the plaintiff, demanding payment for money due. In addition,key holes of the locks on the main office door of Versatile were plugged and painted over in red. Both the 1st and 2nd defendantsmade themselves a nuisance at the reception area of the plaintiff's legal firm. Time and again the 1st and the 2nd defendants alsotelephoned Versatile demanding to see the plaintiff, threatening the plaintiff with menaces and pressing for a settlement of thedebts claimed to be due from Versatile. The 1st defendant even personally intimidated the plaintiff. In no time the 1st defendantand Versatile brought proceedings in the Labour Tribunal against one another. Later, Versatile instituted a District Court actionagainst the 1st defendant for various relief including its Labour Tribunal claims which were thereupon discontinued. By consent the1st defendant's Labour Tribunal claim was also transferred to the District Court, and the two sets of District Court proceedingsbetween Versatile and the 1st defendant were consolidated.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The plaintiff commenced this High Court action against the defendants for, inter alia, an injunction restraining them from assaulting,threatening to assault, harassing, molesting, interfering with, disturbing, approaching or attempting to approach the plaintiff forassaults or harassment and from entering the premises of Versatile and the plaintiff's legal firm. The plaintiff further claimedagainst the defendants "damages for harassment and intimidation as pleaded in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Statement of Claim". Thus,the damages claimed in the Statement of Claim flowed in effect from the alleged wrongdoings pleaded in its paragraph 6, viz.:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The defendants have maliciously and wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff, by threats and unlawful means intimidatedand coerced the plaintiff directly and indirectly to pay to the 1st defendant a sum of money allegedly due to the 1st defendant byVersatile which alleged debt the plaintiff was not legally bound to pay".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> These wrongdoings were threats allegedly delivered on some eight occasions by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff, whereby the 1stdefendant was said to have intentionally caused the plaintiff to act to her own detriment. The eight incidents were particularised.What is averred in paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim is the tort of intimidation, allegedly committed in a great many manifestations.Of the tortious damages claimed, only $6,000 in loss of professional chargeable time was pleaded as special damages.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The steps taken by Versatile and the role played by the plaintiff in the course of the proceedings led to judicial strictures andthe plaintiff's legal firm being mulcted in costs on solicitor and own client basis. Whilst the defendants were accused of roguishbehaviour, the conduct of relevant proceedings by the plaintiff through her firm was censured, in the main, for being procedurallyhigh-handed and oppressive.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> This High Court action was commenced on 28 December 1992, and on 6 January 1993 the plaintiff obtained an interlocutory injunctionagainst both defendants in terms of the above permanent injunction prayed for in the Statement of Claim. Thereafter, there has beenno further incident causing the plaintiff anguish or embarrassment. The plaintiff had by then been awarded costs which had yet tobe taxed, but the amount said to have been already incurred was some $320,000 with another $330,000 estimated costs to follow. Whenthe plaintiff applied ex parte to Wong, J for a Mareva injunction on 16 May 1994, her primary purpose was clearly identified to thejudge as one of securing sufficient fund within jurisdiction for satisfying litigation costs in execution. Her pleaded special damagesof $6,000, being fees for lost professional chargeable hours, were not particularly highlighted, but the Statement of Claim in whichdamages including these special damages were claimed was placed before Wong, J. On the return date on 24 May 1994 before Deputy JudgeCheung, that purpose became all the more apparent when the Mareva injunction was suspended by consent on the given undertaking tosecure an amount sufficient for covering the $650,000 estimated costs. Evidently, the ex parte Mareva injunction needed to be affirmed,and the inter partes application for its continuation came before Woo, J on 26 July 1994. Some time prior to the institution of thisHigh Court action, the 2nd defendant had disposed of his Taikoktsui property. Shortly before this action, the plaintiff came to learnof defendants' intention to sell their Shatin flat. These defendants were from Singapore and Macau. The plaintiff then looked uponall this as evidence of risk of dissipation of assets. In fact later the 1st defendant so categorically stated in her affirmation.Such harboured intention to sell was also subsequently verified by the defendants and their counsel later in the Mareva proceedings.On the second day of hearing before Woo, J, the plaintiff became aware that the defendant had re-invested the net proceeds of saleof their Shatin flat in the purchase of a new property. The plaintiff had yet to obtain documentary confirmation of the re-purchase.After the luncheon adjournment on the second day of hearing i.e. 29 July 1994, the plaintiff concluded that there was no longer anyreal risk of dissipation of assets to sustain the Mareva injunction, and she proposed to allow the injunction to be discharged andgive the defendants costs on an indemnity basis provided that the defendants could produce an updated land search for the said newproperty acquisition. The parties failed to come to terms and the proceedings were proceeded with before Woo, J exclusively on thequestion of costs. The plaintiff offered party and party costs; the defendants sought indemnity costs. Woo, J handed down judgmenton 12 September 1994, in which he awarded costs against the plaintiff in the Mareva proceedings on an indemnity basis.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Leave to appeal against Woo, J's judgment on costs was ultimately granted by Bokhary, JA on 22 November 1994. Leave had previouslybeen refused by Woo, J and Godfrey, JA.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> When the appeal was called on before us, the real issues were relatively uninvolved, and they could be shortly stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) whether Woo, J was right in awarding indemnity costs, leave to appeal having been granted; and</p>        <p>(2) if Woo, J was wrong, whether his order can be otherwise supported.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In entertaining the plaintiff's resistance to the defendants' application for indemnity costs, Woo, J considered as the thresholdquestion the court's jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction for primarily securing payments of costs, including estimated costs.The judge concluded that an injunction could be issued to protect "orders for costs that (might) be obtained by a plaintiff". Under23 Rule 1 RSC security for costs cannot be ordered against a defendant. The procedural nature of Order 23 Rule 1 was acknowledgedby Woo, J as being juridically incapable of abrogating the court's liberal jurisdiction to grant Mareva injunctions for securingpayment of costs, spent or to be incurred. Clearly, in exercising such a jurisdiction, the court should have regard to the basicrule that a defendant cannot be called upon to provide security for costs. With the view of Woo, J I entirely agree. The judge'sdecision on jurisdiction was not even sought to be impugned before us.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Was Woo, J wrong in awarding indemnity costs? The judge took into account the District Court proceedings and what had transpiredas "surrounding circumstances" for deciding costs in the Mareva injunction. For costs in an interim application, Buckley, LJ hadthis to say in <strong>Scherer v. Counting Instruments Limited (C. A.)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 615</a> at p. 618 Letters E - J:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Conduct which might be relevant to how the costs of the action should ultimately be borne may be quite irrelevant to whether a partywas justified in making a particular interlocutory application. In such a context one naturally starts from a basis of consideringwhether the defendants were justified in launching their motions for dismissal of the actions for want of prosecution. The relevantproceedings are not the actions in their full extent, but the motions for dismissal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Whilst the courts should consider, with reference to the question of costs in an action after trial, "all circumstances relevantto the issues in the action and the history of the action hitherto and the matters leading to the action", that is to say, "the wholebattlefield of the action and the whole of the conduct of the parties in relation to the matter in dispute", for deciding costs inan interlocutory application, Woo, J ought to have focused on the application itself "from a basis of considering whether the (plaintiffwas) justified in launching (her Mareva application)". See Scherer, ibid. P. 61B Letters D - E. Before Woo, J, the plaintiff didnot find it right to seek to maintain the Mareva upon being fed the confirmatory evidence of a re-investment of the proceeds of saleof the defendants' Shatin property. The concession was readily made as soon as the plaintiff was satisfied with the evidence of thatre-investment. Resorting to the court's jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction for securing payment of costs awarded or to beawarded was good justification for the plaintiff to launch, on the evidence of risk of dissipation she then had, her interlocutoryapplication. Whether the plaintiff would succeed, wholly or in part, at the substantive hearing of her interim application was amatter which did not call for a determination because continuation of the injunction was regarded as no longer necessary or supportablein the developing circumstances. It was not open to the judge to take into consideration the previous unconnected proceedings assurrounding circumstances in his deliberation on costs. Whether Versatile and the plaintiff had been unreasonable, unconscionable,oppressive or vexatious are not matters relevant to the plaintiff's interlocutory application for securing payment of costs. Suchdraconian protection with respect to payment of costs claimed in the plaintiff's interlocutory application could hardly be affectedby her and Versatile's ulterior motive, if any, or their past conduct in the District Court proceedings. Moreover, no finding wasmade by Woo, J that the plaintiff, by herself or through her legal advisers, had deliberately withheld information pertaining tothe District Court proceedings, which for the reasons given the plaintiff was not obliged in any case to disclose in her ex parteapplication.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It is also indefensible to ascribe mala fides to the plaintiff on the face of affidavit evidence. I need not go any further withcounsel's critical examination of the judgment of the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> What are the guidelines for awarding indemnity costs? Except for the recognised contempt cases, special or unusual features haveas a rule to be shown to justify an award of costs on an indemnity basis, such as abuse of court process, scandalous or vexatiousproceedings, proceedings improperly prosecuted with malice or an ulterior motive or in an oppressive manner, circumstances constitutingan affront to the court etc. See <strong>Overseas Trust Bank Limited v. Coopers and Lybrand and Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20HKLR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 HKLR 177</a> at p. 183 A - C, per Godfrey, J as he then was. None of these special or unusual features existed in this case. The plaintiff wasjustified in launching her interlocutory application for a Mareva injunction, and her consent to its discharge was given later fora reason which she regarded as compelling. Woo, J's order for costs on an indemnity basis cannot be supported for the reasons hegave.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I pass on then to the next issue: can the decision of the judge be otherwise supported? There is no substance in any of the mattersraised in the Supplementary Respondents' Notice. Unless the defendants are prepared to give the same undertaking at the conclusionof the action, there are good prospects for the plaintiff's prayer of permanent injunction to succeed. The claim for damages forharassment and intimidation as specified in paragraphs 6 &amp; 7 of the Statement of Claim is a claim sustainable in Tort. Therewas evidence of risk of dissipation of assets. It cannot be said that the plaintiff's interlocutory application was launched withoutany pretence of justification or that it was misconceived or oppressive. There was no special or unusual feature for visiting theplaintiff with a stringent order of costs. Nothing warrants an invitation to be extended to the respondents for amending their SupplementaryNotice so as to enable new grounds to be properly debated. The award of indemnity costs cannot be otherwise supported. I would allowthe appeal with costs and set aside the order of the judge. An open offer was made by letter through the plaintiff's solicitors tothe defendants' solicitors for payment of the defendants' cost on a party and party basis up to, by necessary implication, 11 August1994. I would order that the plaintiff do pay the defendants' costs of the plaintiff's application for "Mareva relief" up to andincluding the 11 August 1994 on a party and party basis. I would make a further order that the defendants do pay the plaintiff'scosts thereafter including those of the plaintiff's applications for leave to appeal. All orders for costs be orders nisi. The respondents'Supplementary Notice is to stand dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Ryan, J.:</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I have had the opportunity of considering both judgments in draft.
